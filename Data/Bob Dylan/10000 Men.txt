ten thousand men on a hill
ten thousand men on a hill
some of 'em going down, some of 'em gonna get killed


ten thousand men dressed in oxford blue
ten thousand men dressed in oxford blue
drumming in the morning, in the evening they'll be coming for you


ten thousand men on the move
ten thousand men on the move
none of them doing nothin' that your mama wouldn't disapprove


ten thousand men digging for silver and gold
ten thousand men digging for silver and gold
all clean shaven, all coming in from the cold


hey, who could your lover be?
hey, who could your lover be?
let me eat off his head and you can really see


ten thousand women all dressed in white
ten thousand women all dressed in white
standing at my window wishing me goodnight


ten thousand men looking so lean and frail
ten thousand men looking so lean and frail
each one of 'em got seven wives, each one of 'em just out of jail


ten thousand women all sweepin' my room
ten thousand women all sweepin' my room
spilling my buttermilk, sweeping it up with a broom


ooh, baby, thank you for my tea
baby, thank you for my tea
it's really so sweet of you to be so nice to me
