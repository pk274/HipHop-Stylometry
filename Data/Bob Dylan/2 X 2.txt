one by one, they followed the sun
one by one, until there were none
two by two, to their lovers they flew
two by two, into the foggy dew
three by three, they danced on the sea
four by four, they danced on the shore
five by five, they tried to survive
six by six, they were playing with tricks


how many paths did they try and fail?
how many of their brothers and sisters lingered in jail?
how much poison did they inhale?
how many black cats crossed their trail?


seven by seven, they headed for heaven
eight by eight, they got to the gate
nine by nine, they drank the wine
ten by ten, they drank it again


how many tomorrows have they given away?
how many compared to yesterday?
how many more without any reward?
how many more can they afford?


two by two, they stepped into the ark
two by two, they step in the dark
three by three, theyâ€™re turning the key
four by four, they turn it some more


one by one, they follow the sun
two by two, to another rendezvous
