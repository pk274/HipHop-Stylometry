when i send for my baby, man, and she don't come
send for my baby, man, and she don't come
all the doctors in hot springs sure ain't gonna help her none
if she gets unruly, thinks she don't want you
if she gets unruly and thinks she don't want you

she got a .38 special, but i believe it's much too light
she got a .38 special, but i believe it's much too light
i got a 32-30, makes the camp all right


if i send for my baby, man, and she don't come

if i send for my baby, man, and she don't come
send for my baby, man, and she don't come
all the doctors in, sure ain't gonna help her none
