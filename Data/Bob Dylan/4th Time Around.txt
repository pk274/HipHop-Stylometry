when she said
“don’t waste your words, they’re just lies”
i cried she was deaf
and she worked on my face until breaking my eyes
and said, “what else you got left?”
yeah, it was then that i got up to leave
but she said, “don’t forget
everybody must give something back
for something they get”


i stood there and hummed
i tapped on her drum i asked her "how come?"
and she buttoned her boot
and straightened her suit
then she said, “don’t get cute”
so i forced my hands in my pockets
and felt with my thumbs
and gallantly handed her
my very last piece of gum


she threw me outside
i stood in the dirt where everyone walked
and after finding out i’d
forgotten my shirt
i went back and knocked
i waited in the hallway, she went to get it
and i tried to make sense
out of that picture of you in your wheelchair
that leaned up against


her jamaican rum
and when she did come, i asked her for some
she said, “no, dear”
i said, “your words aren’t clear
you’d better spit out your gum”
she screamed 'til her face got so red
then she fell on the floor
and i covered her up and then
thought i’d go look through her drawer


and when i was through
i filled up my shoe
and brought it to you
and you, you took me in
you loved me then
you never wasted time
and i, i never took much
i never asked for your crutch
now don’t ask for mine
