pardon me if i'm sentimental, came to say goodbye
don't be angry, don't be angry with me, should i cry
when you're gone, i will dream a little dream as years go by
now and then there's a fool, a fool such as i (such as i)


now and then there's a fool such as i am over you
you taught me how to love and now you's had to be untrue
i am a fool but i love you, dear, yes i will, till the day i die
now and then there is a fool such as i (such as i)
