how many times have you heard someone say
if i had his money i'd do things my way
hmm, but little they know
hmm, it's so hard to find
one rich man in ten with a satisfied mind


hmm, once i was wading in fortune and fame
everything that i dreamed of to get a start in lifeâ€™s game
but suddenly it happened
hmm, i lost every dime
but i'm richer by far with a satisfied mind


hmm, when my life is over and my time has run out
my friends and my love ones
i'll leave there's no doubt
but one thing for certain
when it comes my time
i'll leave this old world with a satisfied mind
