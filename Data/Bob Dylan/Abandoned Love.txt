i can see the turning of the key
i’ve been deceived by the clown inside of me
i thought that he was righteous but he’s vain
oh, something’s a-telling me i wear the ball and chain


my patron saint is a-fighting with a ghost
he’s always off somewhere when i need him most
the spanish moon is rising on the hill
but my heart is a-tellin’ me i love ya still


i come back to the town from the flaming moon
i see you in the streets, i begin to swoon
i love to see you dress before the mirror
won’t you let me in your room one time ’fore i finally disappear?


everybody’s wearing a disguise
to hide what they’ve got left behind their eyes
but me, i can’t cover what i am
wherever the children go i’ll follow them


i march in the parade of liberty
but as long as i love you i’m not free
how long must i suffer such abuse
won’t you let me see you smile one time before i turn you loose?


i’ve given up the game, i’ve got to leave
the pot of gold is only make-believe
the treasure can’t be found by men who search
whose gods are dead and whose queens are in the church


we sat in an empty theater and we kissed
i asked ya please to cross me off-a your list
my head tells me it’s time to make a change
but my heart is telling me i love ya but you’re strange


one more time at midnight, near the wall
take off your heavy makeup and your shawl
won’t you descend from the throne, from where you sit?
let me feel your love one more time before i abandon it
