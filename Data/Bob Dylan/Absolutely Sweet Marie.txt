well, your railroad gate
you know i just can't jump it
sometimes it gets so hard, you see
i just sitting here, beating on my trumpet
with all these promises you left for me
but where are you tonight, sweet marie?


well, i waited for you when i was half sick
yes, i waited for you when you hated me
well, i waited for you inside of the frozen traffic
yeah, when you knew i had some other place to be
now, where are you tonight, sweet marie?


well, anybody can be just like me, obviously
but then, now again, not too many can be like you, fortunately


well, six white horses that you did promise
were finally delivered down to the penitentiary
but to live outside the law, you must be honest
i know you always say that you agree
alright, so where are you tonight, sweet marie?


well, i don't know how it happened
but the riverboat captain, he knows my fate
but everybody else, even yourself
they're just gonna have to wait


well, i got the fever down in my pockets
the persian drunkard, he follows me
yes, i can take him to your house, but i can't unlock it
you see, you forgot to leave me with the key
oh, where are you tonight, sweet marie?


well, i been in jail when all the mail showed
that a man can't give his address out to bad company
and now i stand here lookin' at your yellow railroad
in the ruins of your balcony
wondering where you are tonight, sweet marie
