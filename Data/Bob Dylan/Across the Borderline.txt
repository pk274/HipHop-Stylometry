there's a place where i've been told
every street is paved with gold
and it's just across the borderline
and when it's time to take your turn
here's a lesson that you must learn
you could lose more than you'll ever hope to find


when you reach the broken promised land
and every dream slips through your hands
then you'll know that it's too late to change your mind
'cause you've paid the price to come so far
just to wind up where you are
and you'rе still just across the borderline


up and down thе rio grande
a thousand footprints in the sand
reveal a secret no one can define
the river flows on like a breath
in between our life and death
tell me, who's the next to cross the borderline?


and when you reach the broken promised land
every dream slips through your hands
and you'll know it's too late to change your mind
'cause you pay the price to come so far
just to wind up where you are
and you're still just across the borderline
now you're still just across the borderline
