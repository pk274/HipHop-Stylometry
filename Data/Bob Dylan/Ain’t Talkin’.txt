as i walked out tonight in the mystic garden
the wounded flowers were danglin' from the vine
i was passin' by yon cool and crystal fountain
someone hit me from behind


ain't talkin', just a'walkin'
through this weary world of woe
heart burnin', still yearnin'
no one on earth would ever know


they say prayer has the power to help
so pray from the mother
in the human heart an evil spirit can dwell
i'm a'tryin' to love my neighbor and do good unto others
but oh, mother, things ain't goin' well


ain't talkin', just a'walkin'
i'll burn that bridge before you can cross
heart burnin', still yearnin'
they'll be no mercy for ya' once you've lost


now i'm all worn down by weepin'
my eyes are filled with tears, my lips are dry
if i catch my opponents ever sleepin'
i'll just slaughter them where they lie


ain't talkin', just a'walkin'
through the world mysterious and vague
heart burnin', still yearnin'
walkin' a'through the cities of the plague


well, the whole world is filled with speculation
the whole wide world which people say is round
they will tear your mind away from contemplation
they will jump on your misfortune when you're down


ain't talkin', just a'walkin'
eatin' hog-eyed grease in a hog-eyed town
heart burnin', still yearnin'
someday you'll be glad to have me around


they will crush you with wealth and power
every wakin' moment you could crack
i'll make the most of one last extra hour
i'll avenge my father's death an' i'll step back


ain't talkin', just walkin'
hand me down my walkin' cane
heart burnin', still yearnin'
got to get ya' out of my miserable brain


all o' my loyal and much-loved companions
they approve of me and share my code
i practice a faith that's been long abandoned
ain't no altars on this long and lonesome road


ain't talkin', just a'walkin'
my mule is sick, my horse is blind
heart burnin', still yearnin'
thinkin' ‘bout that gal i left behind


well, it's bright in the heavens and the wheels are flyin'
fame and honor never seem to fade
the fire gone out but the light is never dyin'
who says i can't get heavenly aid?


ain't talkin', just a'walkin'
carryin' a dead man's shield
heart burnin', still yearnin'
a'walkin' a'with a toothache in my heel


the sufferin' is unending
every nook and cranny has its tears
i'm a'not playin', i'm not pretending
i'm not nursin' any superfluous fears


ain't talkin', just a'walkin'
walkin' ever since the other night
heart burnin', still yearnin'
walkin' ‘til i'ma clean outta sight


as i walked out in the mystic garden
on a hot summer day, a hot summer lawn
"excuse me, ma'am, i beg your pardon
there's no one here, the gardener is gone"


ain't talkin', a'just a'walkin'
up the road around the bend
heart burnin', still yearnin'
in the last outback, at the world's end
