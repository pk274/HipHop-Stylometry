alberta let your hair hang low
alberta let your hair hang low
i'll give you more gold
than your apron can hold
if you'd only let your hair hang low


alberta what's on your mind
alberta what's on your mind
you keep me worried and bothered
all of the time
alberta what's on your mind


alberta don't you treat me unkind
alberta don't you treat me unkind
oh my heart is so sad
cause i want you so bad
alberta don't you treat me unkind


alberta let your hair hang low
alberta let your hair hang low
i'll give you more gold
than your apron can hold
if you'll only let your hair hang low
