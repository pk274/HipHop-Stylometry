well, if i had to do it all over again
babe, i’d do it all over you
and if i had to wait for ten thousand years
babe, i’d even do that too
well, a dog’s got his bone in the alley
a cat, she’s got nine lives
a millionaire’s got a million dollars
king saud’s got four hundred wives
well, ev’rybody’s got somethin’
that they’re looking’ forward to
i’m looking’ forward to when i can do it all again
and babe, i’ll do it all over you


well, if i had my way tomorrow or today
babe, i’d run circles all around
i’d jump up in the wind, do a somersault and spin
i’d even dance a jig on the ground
well, everybody gets their hour
everybody gets their time
little david when he picked up his pebbles
even sampson after he went blind
well, everybody gets the chance
to do what they want to do
when my time arrives you better run for your life
’cause babe, i’ll do it all over you


well, i don’t need no money, i just need a day that’s sunny
baby, and my days are gonna come
and i grab me a pint, you know that i’m a giant
when you hear me yelling’, “fee-fi-fo-fum”
well, you cut me like a jigsaw puzzle
you made me to a walk-in’ wreck
then you pushed my heart through my backbone
then you knocked off my head from my neck
well, if i’m ever stand-in’ steady
a-doin’ what i want to do
well, i tell you little lover that you better run for cover
’cause babe, i’ll do it all over you


i’m just resting’ at your gate so that i won’t be late
and, momma, i’m a-just sitting’ on the shelf
look out your window fair and you’ll see me squatting’ there
just a-fumblin’ and a-mumbling’ to myself
well, after my cigarette’s been smoked up
after all my liquor’s been drunk
after my dreams are dreamed out
after all my thoughts have been thunk
well, after i do some of these things
i’m gonna do what i have to do
and i tell you on the side, that you better run and hide
’cause babe, i’ll do it all over you
