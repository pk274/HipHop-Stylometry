all or nothing at all
half a love never appealed to me
if your heart never could yield to me
then i'd rather have nothing at all


all or nothing at all
if it's love there is no in-between
why begin then cry for something that might have been
no, i'd rather have nothing at all


please don't bring your lips so close to my cheek
don't smile, i'll be lost beyond recall
the kiss in your eyes and the touch of your hand makes me weak
and my heart may grow dizzy and fall


and if i fell under the spell of your call
i would be caught in the undertow
and so you see, i've got to say "no, no"
all or nothing at all


all or nothing at all
