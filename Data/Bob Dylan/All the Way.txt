when somebody loves you
it's no good unless he loves you all the way
happy to be near you
when you need someone to cheer you all the way


taller than the tallest tree is
that's how it's got to feel
deeper than the deep blue sea is
that's how deep it goes if it's real


when somebody needs you
it's no good unless she needs you all the way
through the good or lean years
and for all those in-between years come what may


who knows where the road will lead us
only a fool would say
but if you'll let me love you
it's for sure i'm gonna love you all the way, all the way
