well, it’s always been my nature to take chances
my right hand drawing back while my left hand advances
where the current is strong and the monkey dances
to the tune of a concertina


blood dryin’ in my yellow hair as i go from shore to shore
i know what it is that has drawn me to your door
but i don't know what it is makes you think you’ve seen me before
angelina


oh, angelina
oh, angelina


her eyes were two slits that would make any snake proud
with a face that any painter would paint and she was well-endowed
praising the dead as she rode a donkey through the crowd
or was it a hyena?


do i need your permission to turn my other cheek?
if you can read my thoughts, why must i speak?
no, i have heard nothin' about the man that you seek
angelina


oh, angelina
oh, angelina


in the valley of the giants where the stars and stripes explode
the peaches they were sweet and the milk and honey flowed
i was only following instructions when the judge sent me down the road
with your subpoena


a peaceful exchange of ideas for you was always too tame
inter-tribal warfare was always more your style that your game
your best friend and my worst enemy is one and the same
angelina


oh, angelina
oh, angelina


there’s a black mercedes rolling through the combat zone
your servants are half-dead, you’re down to the bone
tell me, tall man, where would you like to be overthrown?
in jerusalem or argentina?


she was stolen from her mother when she was three days old
now her vengeance has been satisfied and her strength cards are showin' gold
he’s surrounded by god’s angels and she’s wearing’ a blindfold
and so are you, angelina


oh, angelina
oh, angelina


i see pieces of men marching, trying to take heaven by force
i can see the unknown rider, i can see the pale white horse
in god’s truth name tell me what you want and you’ll have it of course
just step into the arena


beat a path of retreat up them spiral staircases
pass the tree of smoke, pass the angel with four faces
begging god for mercy and weepin’ and moanin' in unholy places
angelina


oh, angelina
oh, angelina
(oh, oh angelina)
(oh, oh angelina)
