sometimes i’m in the mood, i want to leave my lonesome home
and sometimes i’m in the mood, i want to hear my milk cow moan
and sometimes i’m in the mood, i want to hit that highway road
but then again, but then again, i said oh, i said oh, i said
oh babe, i’m in the mood for you


sometimes i’m in the mood, lord, i had my overflowing fill
sometimes i’m in the mood, i’m going to make out my final will
sometimes i’m in the mood, i’m going to head for the walking hill
but then again, but then again, i said oh, i said oh, i said
oh babe, i’m in the mood for you


sometimes i’m in the mood, i want to lay right down and die
sometimes i’m in the mood, i want to climb up to the sky
sometimes i’m in the mood, i’m going to laugh until i cry
but then again, i said again, i said again, i said
oh babe, i’m in the mood for you


sometimes i’m in the mood, i’m going to sleep in my pony’s stall
sometimes i’m in the mood, i ain’t going to do nothing at all
sometimes i’m in the mood, i want to fly like a cannonball
but then again, but then again, i said oh, i said oh, i said
oh babe, i’m in the mood for you


sometimes i’m in the mood, i want to back up against the wall
sometimes i’m in the mood, i want to run till i have to crawl
sometimes i’m in the mood, i ain’t going to do nothing at all
but then again, but then again, i said oh, i said oh, i said
oh babe, i’m in the mood for you


sometimes i’m in the mood, i want to change my house around
sometimes i’m in the mood, i’m going to make a change in this here town
sometimes i’m in the mood, i’m going to change the world around
but then again, but then again, i said oh, i said oh, i said
oh babe, i’m in the mood for you
