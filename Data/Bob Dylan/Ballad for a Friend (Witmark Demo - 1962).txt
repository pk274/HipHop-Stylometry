sad i’m a-sittin’ on the railroad track
watching’ that old smokestack
train is a-leavin’ but it won’t be back


years ago we hang around
watching’ trains roll through the town
now that train is a-graveyard bound


where we go up in that north country
lakes and streams and mines so free
i had no better friend than he


something happened to him that day
i thought i heard a stranger say
i hung my head and stole away


a diesel truck was headin’ down
carryin' up a heavy load
left him on a utah road


they carried him back to his hometown
his mother cried, his sister moaned
listening’ to them church bells tone


a diesel truck was rollin' slow
pullin' down a heavy load
it left him on a utah road


i-i sung the last verse for ya because i missed the words the first time i sung them about the truck
