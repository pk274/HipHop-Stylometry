hollis brown, he lived on the outside of town
hollis brown, he lived on the outside of town
with his wife and five children and his cabin broken down


he looked for work and money and he walked a ragged mile
he looked for work and money and ya walked a ragged mile
your children are so hungry that they don't know how to smile


your baby's eyes look crazy, they're a-tugging at your sleeve
your baby's eyes look crazy, they're a-tugging at your sleeve
you walk the floor and wonder why with every breath you breathe


the rats have got your flour, bad blood, it got your mare
the rats have got your flour, bad blood, it got your mare
if there's anyone that knows is there anyone that cares?


he prayed to the lord above, oh, please send you a friend
he prayed to the lord above, oh, please send you a friend
your empty pockets tell ya that you ain't a-got no friend


your babies are crying louder now, it's a-poundin' on your brain
your babies are crying louder now, it's a-poundin' on your brain
your wife's screams are stabbin' ya like the dirty drivin' rain


your grass is turnin' black, there's no water in your well
your grass is turnin' black, there's no water in your well
you spent your last lone dollar on seven shotgun shells


way out in the wilderness a cold coyote calls

your eyes fix on the shotgun that's hanging on the wall


your brain is a-bleedin' and your legs can’t seem to stand
your brain is a-bleedin' and your legs can’t seem to stand
your eyes fix on the shotgun that you're holding in your hand


there's seven breezes blowin' all around the cabin door
there's seven breezes blowin' all around the cabin door
seven shots ring out like the ocean's poundin' roar


there's seven people dead on a south dakota farm
there's seven people dead on a south dakota farm
somewheres in the distance there's seven new people born
