oh, well, i love ya pretty baby
you're the only love i've ever known
just as long as you stay with me
the whole world is my throne


well, i'm moving after midnight
down boulevards of broken cars
don't know what i'd do without it
without this love that we call ours


down every street there's a window
and every window made of glass
we'll keep on loving, pretty baby
for as long as love will last


well, my ship is in the harbor
and the sails are spread
listen to me, pretty baby
lay your hand upon my head
