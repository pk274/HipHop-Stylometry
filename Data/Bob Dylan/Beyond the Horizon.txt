beyond the horizon, behind the sun
at the end of the rainbow life has only begun
in the long hours of twilight 'neath the stardust above
beyond the horizon it is easy to love


my wretched heart's pounding
i felt an angel's kiss
my memories are drowning
in mortal bliss

beyond the horizon, in the springtime or fall
love waits forever for one and for all


beyond the horizon across the divide
'round about midnight, we'll be on the same side
down in the valley the water runs cold
beyond the horizon someone prayed for your soul


i'm touched with desire
what don't i do?
i'll throw the logs on the fire
i'll build my world around you

beyond the horizon, at the end of the game
every step that you take, i'm walking the same


beyond the horizon the night winds blow
the theme of a melody from many moons ago
the bells of st. mary, how sweetly they chime
beyond the horizon i found you just in time


it's dark and it's dreary
i ponder in vain
i'm weakened, i'm weary
my repentance is plain

beyond the horizon o'er the treacherous sea
i still can't believe that you've set aside your love for me


beyond the horizon, 'neath crimson skies
in the soft light of morning i'll follow you with my eyes
through countries and kingdoms and temples of stone
beyond the horizon right down to the bone



it's late in the season
never knew, never cared
whatever the reason
someone's life has been spared


beyond the horizon the sky is so blue
i've got more than a lifetime to live lovin' you
