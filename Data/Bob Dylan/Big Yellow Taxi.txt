they paved paradise, they put up a parking lot
a pink hotel, a boutique and a swinging hot spot
don't it always go to show
you never know what you got till it's gone?
they paved paradise, they put up a parking lot


they took all the trees, they put them in a tree museum
they charged the people a dollar and a half just to see 'em
don't it always go to show
you never know what you got till it's gone?
they paved paradise, they put up a parking lot


hey farmer, farmer, put away that d.d.t
give me spots on my apples but leave me the birds and the bees, please
don't it always go to show
you never know what you got till it's gone?
they paved paradise, they put up a parking lot


late last night, i heard my screen door slam
a big yellow bulldozer took away the house and land
don't it always go to show
you never know what you got till it's gone?
they paved paradise, they put up a parking lot
they paved paradise, they put up a parking lot
they paved paradise, they put up a parking lot
paved paradise, they put up a parking lot
