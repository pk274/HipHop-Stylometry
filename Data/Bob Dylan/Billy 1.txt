there’s guns across the river aimin’ at ya
lawman on your trail, he’d like to catch ya
bounty hunters, too, they’d like to get ya
billy, they don’t like you to be so free


campaign’ out all night on the veranda
dealing’ cards ’till dawn in the hacienda
up to boot hill they’d like to send ya
billy, don’t you turn your back on me


playing’ around with some sweet señorita
into her dark hallway she will lead ya
in some lonesome shadows she will greet ya
billy, you’re so far away from home


there’s eyes behind the mirrors in empty places
bullet holes and scars between the spaces
there’s always one more notch and ten more paces
billy, and you’re walking’ all alone


they say that pat garrett’s got your number
so sleep with one eye open when you slumber
every little sound just might be thunder
thunder from the barrel of his gun


guitars will play your grand finale
down in some tularosa alley
maybe in the rio pecos valley
billy, you’re so far away from home


there’s always some new stranger sneakin’ glances
some trigger-happy fool willin’ to take chances
and some old whore from san pedro to make advances
advances on your spirit and your soul


the businessmen from taos want you to go down
they’ve hired pat garrett to force a showdown
billy, don’t it make ya feel so low-down
to be shot down by the man who was your friend?


hang on to your woman if you got one
remember in el paso, once, you shot one
she may have been a whore, but she was a hot one
billy, you have been running’ for so long


guitars will play your grand finale
down in some tularosa alley
maybe in the rio pecos valley
billy, you’re so far away from home
