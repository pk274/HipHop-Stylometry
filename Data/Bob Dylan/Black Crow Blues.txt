i woke in the mornin', wandering
weary and worn out
i woke in the morning’, wandering
weary and worn out
wishin’ my long-lost lover
would walk to me, and talk to me, tell me what it’s all about


i was standin’ at the side road
listenin’ to the billboard knock
standin' at the side road
listenin’ to the billboard knock
well, my wrist was empty
but my nerves were kickin’, tickin’ like a clock


well i got anything you need, babe
let me tell you in front
if i got anything you need, babe
let me tell you in front
you can come to me sometime
night time, day time, any time you want


sometimes i’m thinkin' i’m
too high to fall
sometimes i’m thinkin' i’m
much too high to fall
other times i’m thinkin' i’m
so low i don’t know if i can come up at all


black crows in the meadow
sleepin' across a broad highway
black crows in the meadow
across a broad highway
though it’s funny, honey
i'm outta' touch, don’t feel much like a scarecrow today
