blue moon, you saw me standing alone
without a dream in my heart, without a love of my own


blue moon, you knew just what i was there for
you heard me saying a prayer for someone i really could care for


and suddenly there appeared before me the only one my arms could ever hold
i heard someone whisper, "please, adore me"
and when i looked my moon had turned to gold


blue moon, now i'm no longer alone
without a dream in my heart, without a love of my own
without a love of my own
