unlike most of the songs nowadays that have been written up in tin pan alley, that's where most of the folk songs come from nowadays, this, this is a song, this wasn't written up there, this was written somewhere down in the united states


well, the lone ranger and tonto
they are riding down the line
fixing everybody’s troubles
everybody’s except mine
somebody must have told them
that i was doing fine


oh you five and ten cent women
with nothing in your heads
i got a real gal i’m loving
and lord i’ll love her till i’m dead
go away from my door and my window too
right now


lord, i am not going down to no race track
see no sports car run
i don’t have no sports car
and i don’t even care to have one
i can walk anytime around the block


well, the wind keeps a-blowing me
up and down the street
with my hat in my hand
and my boots on my feet
watch out so you don’t step on me


well, look it here buddy
you want to be like me
pull out your six-shooter
and rob every bank you can see
tell the judge i said it was all right
yes!
