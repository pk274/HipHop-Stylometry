oh, i'm sailin' away, my own true love
i'm a-sailin' away in the mornin'
is there somethin' i can send you from across the sea
from the place that i'll be landin'?


no, there's nothin' you can send me, my own true love
there's nothin' i'm a-wishing to be ownin'
just a-carry yourself back to me unspoiled
from across that lonesome ocean


ah, but i just thought you might want somethin' fine
made of silver or of golden
either from the mountains of madrid
or from the coast of barcelona


but if i had the stars of the darkest night
and the diamonds from the deepest ocean
i'd forsake them all for your sweet kiss
for that's all i'm wishin' to be ownin'


well, i might be gone a long old time
and it's only that i'm asking
is there somethin' i can send you to remember me by
to make your time more easy passin'?


oh, how can, how can you ask me again?
it only brings me sorrow
the same thing i would want today
i would want again tomorrow


oh, i got a letter on a lonesome day
it was from her ship a-sailin'
sayin', "i don't know when i'll be comin' back again
it depends on how i'm a-feelin'"


if a-you, my love, must think that-a-way
i'm sure your mind is a-roamin'
i'm sure your thoughts are not with me
but with the country to where you're goin'


so, take heed, take heed of the western winds
take heed of the stormy weather
and, yes, there's somethin' you can send back to me
spanish boots of spanish leather
