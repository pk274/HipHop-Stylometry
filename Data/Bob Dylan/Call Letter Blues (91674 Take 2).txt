well, i walked all night long
hearin' them church bells tone
yes, i walked all night long
listen to them church bells tone
either someone needing mercy
or might be somethin' i've done wrong


well, your friends come by for you
i don't know what to say
well, your friends come by for you
i don't know what to say
i just can't face to tell 'em
honey, you just went away


the children cry for mother
i tell 'em, "mother took a trip"
well, the children cry for mother
i tell 'em, "mother took a trip"
well, i walk on pins and needles
i hope my tongue don't slip


well, i gaze at passing strangers
in case i might see you
yes, i gaze at passing strangers
in case i might see you
but the sun goes around the heavens
and another day just drives on through


way out in the distance
i know you're with some other man
way out in the distance
i know you're with some other man
but that's alright, baby
you know i always understand


call girls in the doorway
all givin' me the eye
call girls in the doorway
all givin' me the eye
but my heart's just not in it
i might as well pass right on by


my ears are ringin'
ringin' like empty shells
my ears are ringin'
ringin' like empty shells
well, it can't be no guitar player
it must be combat bells
