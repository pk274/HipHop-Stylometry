well, it's all of fair and handsome girl
she's all in her tender years
she fell in love with a sailor boy
it's true she loved him well
for to go off to sea with him
like she did not know how
she longed to see that seaport town
of canadee-i-o


so she bargained with the sailor boy
all for a piece of gold
straightaway then he led her
down into the hold
sayin', "i'll dress you up in sailor's clothes
your jacket shall be blue
you'll see that seaport town
of canadee-i-o


now, when the other sailors heard the news
well, they fell into a rage
and with all the ship's company
they were willing to engage
saying, "we'll tie her hands and feet, my boys
overboard we'll throw her
she'll never see that seaport town
called canadee-i-o


now, when the captain he heard the news
well, he too fell in a rage
and with the whole ship's company
he was willing to engage
sayin', "she'll stay in sailor's clothes
her color shall be blue
she'll see that seaport town
call canadee-i-o


now, when they come down to canada
scarcely 'bout half a year
she's married this bold captain
who called her his dear
she's dressed in silks and satins now
she cuts a gallant show
finest of the ladies
down canadee-i-o


come, all you fair and tender girls
wheresoever you may be
i'd have you to follow your own true love
whene'er he goes to sea
for if the sailors prove false to you
well, the captain, he might prove true
you'll see the honor i have gained
by the wearing of the blue
