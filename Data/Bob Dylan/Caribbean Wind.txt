she was the rose of sharon from paradise lost
from the city of seven hills near the place of the cross
i was playing a show in miami in the theater of divine comedy
told about jesus, told about the rain
she told me about the jungle where her brothers were slain
by a man who had been dying and disappeared so mysteriously


was she a child or an angel? did we go too far
were we sniper bait? did we follow a star?
to a hole in the wall wall to where the long arm of the law can not reach?
could i been used and played as a pawn?
it certainly was possible as the gay night wore on
where men bathed in perfume and practiced the hopes of free speech


and them caribbean winds still blow from nassau to mexico
fanning the flames in the furnace of desire
and them distant ships of liberty on them iron waves so bold and free
bringing everything that’s near to me nearer to the fire


she looked into my soul through the clothes that i wore
she said, “we got a mutual friend over by the door
and you know he’s got our best interest in mind”
he was well connected but her heart was a snare
and she had left him to die in there
there were payments due and he was a little behind


the cry of the peacock, flies buzz my head
ceiling fan broken, there’s a heat in my bed
street band playing “nearer my god to thee”
we met at the steeple where the mission bells ring
she said, “i know what you’re thinking, but there ain’t a thing
you can do about it, so let us just agree to agree”


and them caribbean winds still blow from nassau to mexico
fanning the flames in the furnace of desire
and them distant ships of liberty on them iron waves so bold and free
bringing everything that’s near to me nearer to the fire


atlantic city by the cold grey sea
i hear a voice crying, “daddy,” i always think it’s for me
but it’s only the silence in the buttermilk hills that call
every new messenger brings evil report
’bout armies on the march and time that is short
and famines and earthquakes and hatred written upon walls


would i have married her? i don’t know, i suppose
she had bells in her braids and they hung to her toes
but i kept hearing my name and had to be moving on
i saw screws break loose, saw the devil pound tin
i saw a house in the country being torn from within
i heard my ancestors calling from the land far beyond


and them caribbean winds still blow from nassau to mexico
fanning the flames in the furnace of desire
and them distant ships of liberty on them iron waves so bold and free
bringing everything that’s near to me nearer to the fire
