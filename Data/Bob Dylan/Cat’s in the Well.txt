the cat’s in the well, the wolf is looking down
the cat’s in the well, the wolf is looking down
he got his big bushy tail dragging all over the ground


the cat’s in the well, the gentle lady is asleep
cat’s in the well, the gentle lady is asleep
she ain’t hearing a thing, the silence is a-stickin’ her deep

the cat’s in the well and grief is showing its face
the world’s being slaughtered and it’s such a bloody disgrace


the cat’s in the well, the horse is going bumpety bump
the cat’s in the well, and the horse is going bumpety bump
back alley sally is doing the american jump

the cat’s in the well, and papa is reading the news
his hair’s falling out and all of his daughters need shoes


the cat’s in the well and the barn is full of bull
the cat’s in the well and the barn is full of bull
the night is so long and the table is oh, so full

the cat’s in the well and the servant is at the door
the drinks are ready and the dogs are going to war


the cat’s in the well, the leaves are starting to fall
the cat’s in the well, leaves are starting to fall
goodnight, my love, may the lord have mercy on us all
