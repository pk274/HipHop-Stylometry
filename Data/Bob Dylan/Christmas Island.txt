how'd you like to spend christmas on christmas island?
how'd you like to spend the holiday away across the sea?
how'd you like to spend christmas on christmas island?
how'd you like to hang a stocking on a great big coconut tree?


how'd you like to stay up late, like the islanders do?
wait for santa to sail in with your presents in a canoe
if you ever spend christmas on christmas island
you'll never stray for everyday your christmas dreams come true

if you ever spend christmas on christmas island
you'll never stray for everyday your christmas dreams come true
