i’m beginning to hear voices and there’s no one around
well, i’m all used up and the fields have turned brown
i went to church on sunday and she passed by
my love for her is taking such a long time to die

i’m waist deep, waist deep in the mist
it’s almost like, almost like i don’t exist
i’m twenty miles out of town in cold irons bound


the walls of pride are high and wide
can’t see over to the other side
it’s such a sad thing to see beauty decay
it’s sadder still to feel your heart torn away

one look at you and i’m out of control
like the universe has swallowed me whole
i’m twenty miles out of town in cold irons bound


there’s too many people, too many to recall
i thought some of ’m were friends of mine, i was wrong about ’m all
well, the road is rocky and the hillside’s mud
up over my head nothing but clouds of blood

i found my world, found my world in you
but your love just hasn’t proved true
i’m twenty miles out of town in cold irons bound
twenty miles out of town in cold irons bound


oh, the winds in chicago have torn me to shreds
reality has always had too many heads
some things last longer than you think they will
there are some kind of things you can never kill

it’s you and you only i been thinking about
but you can’t see in and it’s hard lookin’ out
i’m twenty miles out of town in cold irons bound


well the fat’s in the fire and the water’s in the tank
the whiskey’s in the jar and the money’s in the bank
i tried to love and protect you because i cared
i’m gonna remember forever the joy that we shared

looking at you and i’m on my bended knee
you have no idea what you do to me
i’m twenty miles out of town in cold irons bound
twenty miles out of town in cold irons bound
