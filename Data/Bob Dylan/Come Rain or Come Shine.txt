i'm gonna love you like nobody's loved you
come rain or come shine
high as a mountain and deep as a river
come rain or come shine


i guess when you met me
it was just one of those things
but don't ever bet me
'cause i'm gon' be true if you let me


you're gonna love me like nobody's loved me
come rain or come shine
happy together, unhappy together
and won't that be fine?


days may be cloudy or sunny
we're in or we're out of the money
but i'm with you always
i'm with you rain or shine
