this morning i looked out my window and found
a bluebird singing but there was no one around
at night i lay alone in my bed
with an image of you goin' around in my head


i guess i must have loved you more than i ever knew
my world is empty now 'cause it don't have you
and if i had just one more chance to win your heart again
i would do things differently, but what's the use to pretend?
