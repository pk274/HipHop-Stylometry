corrina, corrina
gal, where you been so long?
i've been worrying about you, baby
baby, please come home


i got a bird that whistles
i got a bird that sings
i got a bird that whistles
i got a bird that sings
but i ain't a-got corrina
life don't mean a thing


corrina, corrina
gal, you're on my mind
corrina, corrina
gal, you're on my mind
i'm a-sittin' down thinkin' of you
i just can't keep from cryin'
