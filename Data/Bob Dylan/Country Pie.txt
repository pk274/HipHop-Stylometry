just like old saxophone joe
when he’s got the hogshead up on his toe
oh me, oh my
love that country pie


listen to the fiddler play
when he’s playin' 'til the break of day
oh me, oh my
love that country pie


raspberry, strawberry, lemon, and lime
what do i care?
blueberry, apple, cherry, pumpkin, and plum
call me for dinner, honey, i’ll be there


saddle me up my big white goose
tie me on her and turn her loose
oh me, oh my
love that country pie


i don’t need much, that ain’t no lie
ain’t runnin' any race
give to me my country pie
i won’t throw it up in anybody’s face


shake me up that old peach tree
a'little jack horner got nothin’ on me
oh me, oh my
love that country pie
