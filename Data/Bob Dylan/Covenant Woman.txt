covenant woman got a contract with the lord
way up yonder, great will be her reward
covenant woman, shining like a morning star
i know i can trust you to stay where you are


and i just got to tell you
i do intend
to stay closer than any friend
i just got to thank you
once again
for making your prayers known
unto heaven for me
and to you, always, so grateful
i will forever be


i’ve been broken, shattered like an empty cup
i’m just waiting on the lord to rebuild and fill me up
and i know he will do it ’cause he’s faithful and he’s true
he must have loved me so much to send me someone as fine as you


and i just got to tell you
i do intend
to stay closer than any friend
i just got to thank you
once again
for making your prayers known
unto heaven for me
and to you, always, so grateful
i will forever be


covenant woman, intimate little girl
who knows those most secret things of me that are hidden from the world
you know we are strangers in a land we’re passing through
i’ll always be right by your side, i’ve got a covenant too


and i just got to tell you
i do intend
to stay closer than any friend
i just got to thank you
once again
for making your prayers known
unto heaven for me
and to you, always, so grateful
i will forever be
