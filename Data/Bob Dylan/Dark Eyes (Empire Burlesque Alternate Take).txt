oh, the gentlemen are talking and the moonlight’s on the riverside
they’re drinking up and walking and it is time for me to slide
i live in another world where life and death are memorized
where the earth is strung with lovers' pearls and all i see are dark eyes


a cock is crowing far away and another soldier’s deep in prayer
some mother’s child has gone astray, she can’t find him anywhere
but i can hear another drum beating for the dead that rise
whom nature’s beast fears as they come and all i see are dark eyes


they tell me to be discreet for all intended purposes
they tell me revenge is sweet and from where they stand, i’m sure it is
but i feel nothing for their game where beauty goes unrecognized
all i feel is heat and flame and all i see are dark eyes


oh, the french girl, she’s in paradise and a drunken man is at the wheel
hunger pays a heavy price to the falling gods of speed and steel
oh, time is short and the days are sweet and passion rules the arrow that flies
a million faces at my feet but all i see are dark eyes
