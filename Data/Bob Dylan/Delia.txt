delia was a gambling girl, gambled all around
delia was a gambling girl, she laid her money down
all the friends i ever had are gone


delia's dear ol' mother took a trip out west
when she returned, little delia gone to rest
all the friends i ever had are gone


delia's daddy weeped, delia's momma moaned
wouldn't have been so bad if the poor girl died at home
all the friends i ever had are gone


curtis' looking high, curtis' looking low
he shot poor delia down with a cruel forty-four
all the friends i ever had are gone


high up on the housetops, high as i can see
looking for them rounders, looking out for me
all the friends i ever had are gone


men in atlanta, tryin' to pass for white
delia's in the graveyard, boys, six feet out of sight
all the friends i ever had are gone


judge says to curtis, "what's this noise about?"
"all about them rounders, judge, tryin' to cut me out."
all the friends i ever had are gone


curtis said to the judge, "what might be my fine?"
judge says, "poor boy, you got ninety-nine."
all the friends i ever had are gone


curtis' in the jail house, drinking from an old tin cup
delia's in the graveyard, she ain't gettin' up
all the friends i ever had are gone


delia, oh delia, how can it be?
you loved all them rounders, never did love me
all the friends i ever had are gone
