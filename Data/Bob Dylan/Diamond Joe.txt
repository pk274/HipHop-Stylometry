now there's a man you'll hear about
most anywhere you go
and his holdings are in texas
and his name is diamond joe


and he carries all his money
in a diamond-studded jar
he never took much trouble
with the process of the law


i hired out to diamond joe, boys
did offer him my hand
he gave me a string of horses
so old they could not stand


and i nearly starved to death, boys
he did mistreat me so
and i never saved a dollar
in the pay of diamond joe


now his bread it was corn dodger
and his meat you couldn't chaw
nearly drove me crazy
with the wagging of his jaw


and the telling of his story
mean to let you know
that there never was a rounder
that could lie like diamond joe




now, i tried three times to quit him
but he did argue so
i'm still punching cattle
in the pay of diamond joe


and when i'm called up yonder
and it's my time to go
give my blankets to my buddies
give the fleas to diamond joe
