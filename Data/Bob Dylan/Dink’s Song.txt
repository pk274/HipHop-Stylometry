if i had wings
like noah's dove
i’d fly the river
to the one i love
fare thee well, my honey
fare thee well


i had a man
who was long and tall
moved his body
like a cannonball
fare thee well, my honey
fare thee well


remember one evening
was drizzling rain
and around my heart
i felt an aching pain
fare thee well, my honey
fare thee well


once i wore
my apron low
couldn’t keep you
away from my door
fare thee well, my honey
fare thee well


now my apron
is up to my chin
you pass my door
but you never come in
fare thee well, my honey
fare thee well


oh, mighty river
runs muddy and wild
can’t care the bloody
for my unborn child
fare thee well, my honey
fare thee well


number 9 train
won’t do no harm
number 9 train
take my poor baby home
fare thee well, my honey
fare thee well


fastest man
i ever saw
skipped missouri
on the way to arkansas
fare thee well, my honey
fare thee well
