he loves your sexy body, he loves your dirty mind
he loves when you hold him, grab him from behind
oh baby, you're such a pretty thing
i can't wait to introduce you to the other members of my gang


you don't need no wax job, you're smooth enough for me
if you need your oil changed, i'll do it for you free
oh baby, the pleasure would be all mine
if you let me drive your pickup truck and park it where the sun don't shine


every time he touches you, his hair stands up on end
his legs begin to quiver and his mind begins to bend
oh baby, you're such a tasty treat
but i'm under doctor's orders, i'm afraid to overeat


he love your sense of humor, disposition too
there's absolutely nothing that he don't love about you
oh baby, i'm on my hands and knees
life would be so simple if i only had you to please
oh baby, turn around and say goodbye
you go to the airport now and i'm going home and cry
