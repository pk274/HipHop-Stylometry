there’s a whole lot of people suffering tonight
from the disease of conceit
whole lot of people struggling tonight
from the disease of conceit
comes right down the highway
straight down the line
rips into your senses
through your body and your mind
nothing about it that’s sweet
the disease of conceit


there’s a whole lot of hearts breaking tonight
from the disease of conceit
whole lot of hearts shaking tonight
from the disease of conceit
steps into your room
eats your soul
over your senses
you have no control
ain’t nothing too discreet
about the disease of conceit


there’s a whole lot of people dying tonight
from the disease of conceit
whole lot of people crying tonight
from the disease of conceit
comes right out of nowhere
and you’re down for the count
from the outside world
the pressure will mount
turn you into a piece of meat
the disease of conceit


conceit is a disease
that the doctors got no cure
they’ve done a lot of research on it
but what it is, they’re still not sure


there’s a whole lot of people in trouble tonight
from the disease of conceit
whole lot of people seeing double tonight
from the disease of conceit
give ya delusions of grandeur
and a evil eye
give you the idea that
you’re too good to die
then they bury you from your head to your feet
from the disease of conceit
