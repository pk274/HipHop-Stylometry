just a minute 'fore you leave, girl
just a minute 'fore you touch the door
what is it that you’re trying to achieve, girl?
do you think we can talk about it some more?
you know, the streets are filled with vipers
who’ve lost all ray of hope
you know, it's not even safe no more
in the palace of the pope

don’t fall apart on me tonight
i just don’t think that i could handle it
don’t fall apart on me tonight
yesterday’s just a memory
tomorrow is never what it’s supposed to be
and i need you, yeah


come over here from over there, girl
sit down here, you can have my chair
i can’t see us goin' anywhere, girl
the only place open is a thousand miles away
and i can’t take you there
i wished i’d have been a doctor
maybe i’d have saved some life that've been lost
maybe i’d have done some good in the world
instead of burning every bridge i crossed


don’t fall apart on me tonight
i just don’t think that i could handle it
don’t fall apart on me tonight
yesterday’s just a memory
tomorrow's never what it’s supposed to be
and i need you, ah, yeah


i ain't too good at conversation, girl
so you might not know exactly how i feel
but if i could i’d bring you to the mountain top, girl
and build you a house made out of stainless steel
but it’s like i’m stuck inside a painting
that’s a-hanging in the louvre
my throat starts to tickle and my nose itches
but i know that i can’t move


don’t fall apart on me tonight
i just don’t think that i could handle it
don’t fall apart on me tonight
yesterday’s gone but the past live' on
tomorrow's just one step beyond
and i need you, ah


who are these people that are walking towards you?
do you know them or will there be a fight?
with their humorless smiles so easy to see through
can they tell you what’s wrong from what’s right?
oh, do you remember st. james street
where you blew jackie p.’s mind?
you were so fine, clark gable would have fell at your feet
and laid his life on the line

let’s try to get beneath the surface waste, girl
no more booby traps and bombs
no more decadence and charms
no more affection that’s misplaced, girl
no more mudcake creatures lying in your arms
what about that millionaire
with the drumsticks in his pants?
he looked so baffled and so bewildered
when he played and we didn’t dance


don’t fall apart on me tonight
i just don’t think that i could handle it
don’t fall apart on me tonight
yesterday is just a memory
tomorrow's never what it’s supposed to be
and i need you
yeah, you, ah
i need you
