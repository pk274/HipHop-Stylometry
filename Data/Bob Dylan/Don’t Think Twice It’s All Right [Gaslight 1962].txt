well it ain't no use to sit and wonder why, babe
if'n you don't know by now
and it ain't no use to sit and wonder why, babe
it'll never do somehow
when your rooster crows at the break of dawn
look out your window and i’ll be gone
you’re the reason i’m a-traveling on
but don’t think twice, it’s all right


and it ain't no use in turning on your light, babe
the light i never knowed
and it ain't no use in turning on your light, babe
i’m on the dark side of the road
but i wish there was something you would do or say
to try and make me change my mind and stay
but we never did too much talking anyway
but don’t think twice, it’s all right


so it ain't no use in calling out my name, gal
like you never done before
and it ain't no use in calling out my name, gal
i can’t hear you anymore
i’m a-thinking and a-wondering, walking down the road
i once loved a woman, a child i’m told
i gave her my heart but she wanted my soul
but don’t think twice, it’s all right





so long, honey babe
where i’m bound, i can’t tell
goodbye's too good a word, babe
so i’ll just say fare thee well
i ain't a-saying you treated me unkind
you could've done better, but i don’t mind
you just kinda wasted my precious time
but don’t think twice, it’s all right
