down along the cove
i spied my true love comin’ my way
down along the cove
i spied my true love comin’ my way
i say, “lord, have mercy, mama
it sure is good to see ya' comin' today"


down along the cove
i spied my little bundle of joy
down along the cove
i spied my little bundle of joy
she said, “lord, have mercy, honey
i’m so glad you’re my boy!”


down along the cove
we walked together hand in hand
down along the cove
we walked together hand in hand
ev’rybody watchin’ us a'go by
knows we’re in love, yes, and they understand
