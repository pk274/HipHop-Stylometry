the light in this place is really bad
like being at the bottom of a stream
any minute now
i’m expecting to wake up from a dream


means so much, the softest touch
by the grave of some child, who neither wept or smiled
i pondered my faith in the rain
i’ve been dreaming’ of you, that’s all i do
and it’s driving me insane


somewhere dawn is breaking
light is streaking across the floor
church bells are ringing
i wonder who they’re ringing for


travel under any star
you’ll see me wherever you are
the shadowy past is awake and so vast
i’m sleeping in the palace of pain
i’ve been dreaming’ of you, that’s all i do
but it’s driving me insane


maybe they’ll get me, maybe they won’t
but whatever it won’t be tonight
i wish your hand was in mine right now
we could go where the moon is white


for years they had me locked in a cage
then they threw me onto the stage
some things just last longer than you thought they would
and they never, ever explain
i’ve been dreaming’ of you, that’s all i do
and it’s driving me insane


well, i eat when i’m hungry, drink when i’m dry
live my life on the square
even if the flesh falls off my face
it won’t matter, long as you’re there


feel like a ghost in love
underneath the heavens above
feel further away than i ever did before
feel further than i can take
dreaming’ of you is all i do
but it’s driving me insane


everything in the way is so shiny today
a queer and unusual fall
spirals of golden haze, here and there in a blaze
like beams of light in the storm


maybe you were here and maybe you weren’t
maybe you touched somebody and got burnt
the silent sun has got me on the run
burning a hole in my brain
i’m dreaming’ of you, that’s all i do
but it’s driving me insane
