i didn’t know that you’d be leaving’
or who you thought you were talking’ to
i figure maybe we’re even
or maybe i’m one up on you


i send you all my money
just like i did before
i tried to reach you honey
but you’re drifting too far from shore


drifting too far from shore
drifting too far from shore
drifting too far from shore
drifting too far from shore


i ain’t gonna get lost in this current
i don’t like playing cat and mouse
no gentleman likes making love to a servant
especially when he’s in his father’s house


i never could guess your weight, baby
never needed to call you my whore
i always thought you were straight, baby
but you’re drifting too far from shore




well these times and these tunnels are haunted
the bottom of the barrel is too
i waited years sometimes for what i wanted
everybody can’t be as lucky as you


never no more do i wonder
why you don’t never play with me anymore
at any moment you could go under
’cause you’re drifting too far from shore




you and me we had completeness
i give you all of what i could provide
we weren’t on the wrong side, sweetness
we were the wrong side


i’ve already ripped out the phones, honey
you can’t walk the streets in a war
i can finish this alone honey
you’re drifting too far from shore
