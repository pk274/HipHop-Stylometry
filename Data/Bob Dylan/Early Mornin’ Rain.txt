in the early mornin' rain with a dollar in my hand
and an achin' in my heart and my pockets full of sand
i'm a long way from home and i miss my loved ones so
in the early mornin' rain with nowhere to go


out on runway number nine big 707 set to go
i'm stuck here on the ground where the cold winds blow
the liquor tasted good and the women all were fast
there she goes, my friend, she's rollin' down at last


hear the mighty engines roar, see the silver bird on high
she's away and westward bound, far above the clouds she'll fly
where the mornin' rain don't fall and the sun always shines
she'll be flyin' over my home in about three hours time


this old airport's got me down, it's no earthly good to me
'cause i'm stuck here on the ground, cold and drunk as i might be
you can't hop a jet plane like you can a freight train
so i'd best be on my way in the early mornin' rain
