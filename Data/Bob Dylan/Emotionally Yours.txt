come baby, find me, come baby, remind me of where i once begun
come baby, show me, show me you know me, tell me you’re the one
i could be learning, you could be yearning to see behind closed doors
but i will always be emotionally yours


come baby, rock me, come baby, lock me into the shadows of your heart
come baby, teach me, come baby, reach me, let the music start
i could be dreaming but i keep believing you’re the one i’m living for
and i will always be emotionally yours


it’s like my whole life never happened
when i see you, it’s as if i never had a thought
i know this dream, it might be crazy
but it’s the only one i’ve got


come baby, shake me, come baby, take me, i would be satisfied
come baby, hold me, come baby, help me, my arms are open wide
i could be unraveling wherever i’m traveling, even to foreign shores
but i will always be emotionally yours
