i sang the song slowly
as she stood in the shadows
she stepped to the light
as my silver strings spun
she called with her eyes
to the tune i’s a-playing
but the song it was long
and i’d only begun


through a bullet of light
her face was reflecting
the fast fading words
that rolled from my tongue
with a long-distance look
her eyes was on fire
but the song it was long
and there was more to be sung


my eyes danced a circle
across her clear outline
with her head tilted sideways
she called me again
as the tune drifted out
she breathed hard through the echo
but the song it was long
and it was far to the end


i glanced at my guitar
and played it pretending
that of all the eyes out there
i could see none
as her thoughts pounded hard
like the pierce of an arrow
but the song it was long
and it had to get done


as the tune finally folded
i laid down the guitar
then looked for the girl
who’d stayed for so long
but her shadow was missing
for all of my searching
so i picked up my guitar
and began the next song
