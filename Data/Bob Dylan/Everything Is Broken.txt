broken lines, broken strings
broken threads, broken springs
broken idols, broken heads
people sleeping in broken beds
ain’t no use jiving
ain’t no use joking
everything is broken


broken bottles, broken plates
broken switches, broken gates
broken dishes, broken parts
streets are filled with broken hearts
broken words never meant to be spoken
everything is broken

seem like every time you stop and turn around
something else just hit the ground


broken cutters, broken saws
broken buckles, broken laws
broken bodies, broken bones
broken voices on broken phones
take a deep breath, feel like you’re choking
everything is broken

every time you leave and go off someplace
things fall to pieces in my face


broken hands on broken ploughs
broken treaties, broken vows
broken pipes, broken tools
people bending broken rules
hound dog howling, bullfrog croaking
everything is broken
