another day that don't end
another ship goin' out
another day of anger, bitterness, and doubt
i know how it happened
i saw it begin
i opened my heart to the world and the world came in


hello, mary lou
hello, miss pearl
my fleet-footed guides from the underworld
no stars in the sky shine brighter than you
you girls mean business and i do too


well, i'm the enemy of treason
an enemy of strife
i'm the enemy of the unlived meaningless life
i ain't no false prophet
i just know what i know
i go where only the lonely can go


i'm first among equals
second to none
the last of the best
you can bury the rest
bury 'em naked with their silver and gold
put 'em six feet under and i pray for their souls


what are you lookin' at?
there's nothing to see
just a cool breeze that's encircling me
let's go for a walk in the garden
so far and so wide
we can sit in the shade by the fountain-side


i search the world over
for the holy grail
i sing songs of love
i sing songs of betrayal
don't care what i drink
i don't care what i eat
i climb the mountain of swords on my bare feet


you don't know me, darlin'
you never would guess
i'm nothing like my ghostly appearance would suggest
i ain't no false prophet
i just said what i said
i'm just here to bring vengeance on somebody's head


put out your hand
there's nothing to hold
open your mouth
i'll stuff it with gold
oh, you poor devil, look up if you will
the city of god is there on the hill


hello, stranger
hello and goodbye
you ruled the land
but so do i
you lusty old mule
you got a poisoned brain
i'll marry you to a ball and chain


you know, darlin'
the kind of life that i live
when your smile meets my smile
something's got to give
i ain't no false prophet
no, i'm nobody's bride
can't remember when i was born
and i forgot when i died
