oh it’s fare thee well my darling’ true
i’m leaving’ in the first hour of the morn
i’m bound off for the bay of mexico
or maybe the coast of californ
so it’s fare thee well my own true love
we’ll meet another day, another time
it ain’t the leavin’
that’s a-grievin’ me
but my true love who’s bound to stay behind


oh the weather is against me and the wind blows hard
and the rain she’s a-turnin’ into hail
i still might strike it lucky on a highway going’ west
though i’m traveling’ on a path beaten trail
so it’s fare thee well my own true love
we’ll meet another day, another time
it ain’t the leaving’
that’s a-grievin’ me
but my true love who’s bound to stay behind


i will write you a letter from time to time
as i’m rambling’ you can travel with me too
with my head, my heart and my hands, my love
i will send what i learn back home to you
so it’s fare thee well my own true love
we’ll meet another day, another time
it ain’t the leaving’
that’s a-grievin’ me
but my true love who’s bound to stay behind


i will tell you of the laughter and of troubles
be them somebody else’s or my own
with my hands in my pockets and my coat collar high
i will travel unnoticed and unknown
so it’s fare thee well my own true love
we’ll meet another day, another time
it ain’t the leaving
that’s a-grievin’ me
but my true love who’s bound to stay behind


i’ve heard tell of a town where i might as well be bound
it’s down around the old mexican plains
they say that the people are all friendly there
and all they ask of you is your name
so it’s fare thee well my own true love
we’ll meet another day, another time
it ain’t the leaving
that’s a-grievin’ me
but my true love who’s bound to stay behind
