feeling funny in my mind, lord
i believe i'm fixing to die, fixing to die
feeling funny in my mind, lord
i believe i'm fixing to die
well, i don't mind dying
but i hate to leave my children crying
well, i look over yonder to that burying ground
look over yonder to that burying ground
sure seems lonesome, lord, when the sun goes down


feeling funny in my eyes, lord
i believe i'm fixing to die, fixing to die
feeling funny in my eyes, lord
i believe i'm fixing to die
well, i don't mind dying but
i hate to leave my children crying
there's a black smoke rising, lord
it's rising up above my head, up above my head
there's a black smoke rising, lord
it's rising up above my head, up above my head
and tell jesus make up my dying bed


i'm walking kind of funny, lord
i believe i'm fixing to die, fixing to die
yes i'm walking kind of funny, lord
i believe i'm fixing to die
fixing to die, fixing to die
well, i don't mind dying
but i hate to leave my children crying
