they say the wife got the husband drunk
but i don't know, i wasn't there, i was visiting a friend in jail
they sang “danny boy” at his funeral and the lord’s prayer
preacher talking ’bout christ betrayal
it’s like the earth just opened and swallowed him up
that he reached too high, tumbled back to the ground
you know what they say about being nice to the right people on the way up
sooner or later you gonna meet them coming down


well, there ain’t no goin’ back, ain't no goin' back
when your foot of pride come down
ain’t no goin’ back


he had a brothеr named paul
you can find him at the cafe royalе
where miss trixie plays and the reviews are mixed
he's on the borderline, says revenge is mine
but he drinks and drinks can be fixed
sing me one more song about whiskey heaven
and your old cold-blooded love affair with errol flynn
in these times of compassion where conformity’s in fashion
say one more stupid thing to me before the final nail is driven in


well, the foot of pride come down
ain’t no goin’ back
