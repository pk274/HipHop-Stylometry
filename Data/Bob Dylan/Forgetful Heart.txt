forgetful heart
lost your power of recall
every little detail
you don't remember at all
the times we knew
who would remember better than you


forgetful heart
we laughed and had a good time you and i
it's been so long
now you're content to let the days go by
when you were there
you were the answer to my prayer


forgetful heart
we loved with all the love that life can give
what can i say
without you it's so hard to live
can't take much more
why can't we love like we did before


forgetful heart
like a walking shadow in my brain
all night long
i lay awake and listen to the sound of pain
the door has closed forevermore
if indeed there ever was a door
