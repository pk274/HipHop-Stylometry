i was born in dixie in a boomer shack
just a little shanty by the railroad track
freight train was it taught me how to cry
the holler of the driver was my lullaby
i got the freight train blues
oh lordy mama, got them in the bottom of my rambling shoes
and when the whistle blows i got to go baby, don't you know
well, it looks like i'm never gonna lose the freight train blues


well, my daddy was a fireman and my mama-ha
she was the only daughter of an engineer
my sweetheart was a brakeman and it ain't no joke
it's a shame the way she keeps a good man broke
i got the freight train blues
oh lordy mama, got them in the bottom of my rambling shoes
and when the whistle blows i got to go woah mama, don't you know
well, it looks like i'm never going to lose the freight train blues


well, the only thing that makes me laugh again
is a southbound whistle on a southbound train
every place i want to go i never can't go
because you know i got the freight train blues
oh lord mama, i got them in the bottom of my rambling shoes
