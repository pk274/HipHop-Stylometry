ain't got no fur slippers now


six o’clock in the evening, i feel so low
ain't got not girlfriend ain't got no place to go
even took my fur slippers away


oh, ain’t got no fur slippers now


where did she go, where can she be?
maybe to a movie show, maybe she's watching tv
she was here yesterday, that's all i can say
all that i know she took my fur slippers away


oh, ain't got no fur slippers now
oh, ain't got no fur slippers now


i cannot go outside, the ground is too hard
where can i go? can't even go in my backyard
can't drive my car nowhere i don't wanna get in, too
i sure do miss them fur slippers as much as i miss you


oh, ain’t got no fur slippеrs now
oh, ain’t got no fur slippers now
