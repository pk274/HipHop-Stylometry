if you're travelin' to the north country fair
where the winds hit heavy on the borderline
remember me to one who lives there
for she once was a true love of mine


if you go when the snowflakes fall
when the rivers freeze and summer ends
please see for me if she's wearing a coat so warm
to keep her from the howling winds


if you're travelin' in the north country fair
where the winds hit heavy on the borderline
please say hello (remember me) to the one who lives there
for she once was a true love of mine

if you're travelin' in the north country fair
where the winds hit heavy on the borderline
remember me to the one who lives there
for she once was a true love of mine


a true love of mine
a true love of mine
a true love of mine
a true love of mine
a true love of mine
a true love of mine
she once was a true love of mine
