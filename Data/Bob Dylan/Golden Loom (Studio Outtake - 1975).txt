smoky autumn night, stars up in the sky
i see the sailing boats across the bay go by
eucalyptus trees hang above the street
and then i turn my head, for you’re approaching me
moonlight on the water, fisherman’s daughter, floating in to my room
with a golden loom


first we wash our feet near the immortal shrine
and then our shadows meet and then we drink the wine
i see the hungry clouds up above your face
and then the tears roll down, what a bitter taste
and then you drift away on a summer’s day where the wildflowers bloom
with your golden loom


i walk across the bridge in the dismal light
where all the cars are stripped between the gates of night
i see the trembling lion with the lotus flower tail
and then i kiss your lips as i lift your veil
but you’re gone and then all i seem to recall is the smell of perfume
and your golden loom
