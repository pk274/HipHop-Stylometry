mary wore three links of chain
every link was jesus name
keep your hand on that plow, hold on
oh lord, oh lord, keep your hand on that plow, hold on


mary, mark, luke and john
all these prophets so good and gone
keep your hand on that plow, hold on
oh lord, oh lord, keep your hand on that plow, hold on
well, i never been to heaven
but i've been told streets up there
are lined with gold
keep your hand on that plow, hold on
oh lord, oh lord, keep your hand on that plow, hold on
oh lord, oh lord, keep your hand on that plow, hold on
oh lord, oh lord, keep your hand on that plow, hold on
