don't ever try to change me
i been in this thing too long
there's nothing' you can say or do
to make me think i'm wrong


well, i'm going' off to libya
there's a guy i gotta see
he's been living there three years now
in an oil refinery
i've got my mind made up
oh, i have got my mind made up


call your ma in tallahassee
tell her her baby's on the line
tell her not to worry
everything is gonna be fine


well, i gave you all my money
all my connections, too
there ain't nothing' in this world, girl
you can say i didn't give to you
i've got my mind made up
i've got my mind made up


you will be alright, girl
someone's watching' over you
he won't do nothing' to you
baby that i wouldn't do


well, if you don't want to see me
look the other way
you don't have to feed me
i ain't your dog that's gone astray
i got my mind made up
i got my mind made up
i got my mind made up
i got my mind made up
i got my mind made up
