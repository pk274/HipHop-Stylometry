well, i ain’t got my childhood
or friends i once did know
no, i ain’t got my childhood
or friends i once did know
but i still got my voice left
i can take it anywhere i go
hey, hey, so i guess i’m doing fine


and i’ve never had much money
but i’m still around somehow
no, i’ve never had much money
but i’m still around somehow
many times i’ve bended
but i ain’t never yet bowed
hey, hey, so i guess i’m doing fine


trouble, oh trouble
i’ve trouble on my mind
trouble, oh trouble
trouble on my mind
but the trouble in the world, lord
is much more bigger than mine
hey, hey, so i guess i’m doing fine


and i never had no armies
to jump at my command
no, i ain’t got no armies
to jump at my command
but i don’t need no armies
i got me one good friend
hey, hey, so i guess i’m doing fine

i been shot at just like you
i been kicked and whipped and trampled on
i been shot at just like you
but as long as the world keeps a-turning

hey, hey, so i guess i’m doing’ fine


well, my road might be rocky
the stones might cut my face
my road it might be rocky
the stones might cut my face
but as some folks ain’t got no road at all
they gotta stand in the same old place
hey, hey, so i guess i’m doing fine
