i got to see you baby, i don’t care
it may be someplace, baby, you say where


i had a dream about you, baby
had a dream about you, baby
late last night you come a-rolling across my mind


you got the crazy rhythm when you walk
you make me nervous when you start to talk


i had a dream about you, baby
had a dream about you, baby
late last night you come a-rolling across my mind


standing on the highway, you flag me down
said, take me daddy, to the nearest town


i had a dream about you, baby
had a dream about you, baby
late last night you come a-rolling across my mind


the joint is jumping
it’s really something
the beat is pumping
my heart is thumping
spent my money on you honey
my limbs are shaking
my mind is breaking


you kiss me, baby, in the coffee shop
you make me so mad, i tell you to stop


i had a dream about you, baby
had a dream about you, baby
late last night you come a-rolling across my mind


you wear a blue scarf upon your head
wearing a long dress fire engine red


i had a dream about you, baby
had a dream about you, baby
late last night you come a-rolling across my mind
