handy dandy, controversy surrounds him
he been around the world and back again
something in the moonlight still hounds him
handy dandy, just like sugar and candy


handy dandy, if every bone in his body was broken he would never admit it
he got an all-girl orchestra and when he says
“strike up the band,” they hit it
handy dandy, handy dandy


you say, “what are ya made of?”
he says, “can you repeat what you said?”
you’ll say, “what are you afraid of?”
he’ll say, “nothin’! neither ’live nor dead.”


handy dandy, he got a stick in his hand and a pocket full of money
he says, “darling, tell me the truth, how much time i got?”
she says, “you got all the time in the world, honey”
handy dandy, handy dandy


he’s got that clear crystal fountain
he’s got that soft silky skin
he’s got that fortress on the mountain
with no doors, no windows, no thieves can break in


handy dandy, sitting with a girl named nancy in a garden feeling kind of lazy
he says, “ya want a gun? i’ll give ya one.” she says, “boy, you talking crazy”
handy dandy, just like sugar and candy
handy dandy, pour him another brandy


handy dandy, he got a basket of flowers and a bag full of sorrow
he finishes his drink, he gets up from the table, he says
“okay, boys, i’ll see you tomorrow”
handy dandy, handy dandy, just like sugar and candy
handy dandy, just like sugar and candy
