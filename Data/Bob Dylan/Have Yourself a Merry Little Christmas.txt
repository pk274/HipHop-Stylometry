have yourself a merry little christmas, let your heart be light
next year all our troubles will be out of sight
have yourself a merry little christmas, make the yuletide gay
next year all our troubles will be miles away


once again as in olden days, happy golden days of yore
faithful friends who are dear to us will be near to us once more
someday soon we all will be together, if the fates allow
until then, we'll have to muddle through somehow
so have yourself a merry little christmas now
