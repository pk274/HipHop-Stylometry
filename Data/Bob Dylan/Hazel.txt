hazel, dirty-blonde hair
i wouldn’t be ashamed to be seen with you anywhere
you got something i want plenty of
ooh, a little touch of your love


hazel, stardust in your eye
you’re going somewhere and so am i
i’d give you the sky high above
ooh, for a little touch of your love


oh no, i don’t need any reminder
to know how much i really care
but it’s just making me blinder and blinder
because i’m up on a hill and still you’re not there


hazel, you called and i came
now don’t make me play this waiting game
you’ve got something i want plenty of
ooh, a little touch of your love
