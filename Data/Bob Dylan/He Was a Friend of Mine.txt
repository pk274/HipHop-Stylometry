he was a friend of mine
he was a friend of mine
every time i think about him now
lord i just can't keep from crying
'cause he was a friend of mine


he died on the road
he died on the road
he never had enough money
to pay his room or board
and he was a friend of mine


i stole away and cried
i stole away and cried
'cause i never had too much money
and i never been quite satisfied
and he was a friend of mine


he never done no wrong
he never done no wrong
a thousand miles from home
and he never harmed no one
and he was a friend of mine


he was a friend of mine
he was a friend of mine
every time i hear his name
lord i just can't keep from crying
'cause he was a friend of mine
