heart of mine be still
you can play with fire but you’ll get the bill
don’t let her know
don’t let her know that you love her
don’t be a fool, don’t be blind
heart of mine


heart of mine go back home
you got no reason to wander, you got no reason to roam
don’t let her see
don’t let her see that you need her
don’t put yourself over the line
heart of mine


heart of mine go back where you been
it’ll only be trouble for you if you let her in
don’t let her hear
don’t let her hear you want her
don’t let her think you think she’s fine
heart of mine


heart of mine you know that she’ll never be true
she’ll only give to others the love that she’s gotten from you
don’t let her know
don’t let her know where you’re going
don’t untie the ties that bind
heart of mine


heart of mine so malicious and so full of guile
give you an inch and you’ll take a mile
don’t let yourself fall
don’t let yourself stumble
if you can’t do the time, don’t do the crime
heart of mine
