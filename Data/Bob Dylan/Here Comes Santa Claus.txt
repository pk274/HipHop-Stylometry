here comes santa claus, here comes santa claus
right down santa claus lane
vixen and blitzen and all his reindeer
are pulling on the reins
bells are ringing, children singing
all is merry and bright
hang your stockings, say your prayers
'cause santa claus comes tonight


here comes santa claus, here comes santa claus
right down santa claus lane
he's got a bag that is filled with toys
for boys and girls again
hear those sleigh bells jingle jangle
what a beautiful sight
so jump in bed, cover your head
'cause santa claus comes tonight


here comes santa claus, here comes santa claus
right down santa claus lane
he doesn't care if you're rich or poor
for he loves you just the same
santa claus knows that we're god's children
that makes everything right
fill your hearts with the christmas cheer
'cause santa claus comes tonight


here comes santa claus, here comes santa claus
right down santa claus lane
he'll come around when the chimes ring out
when it's christmas morn again
peace on earth will come to all
if we just follow the light
fill your hearts with christmas cheer
'cause santa clause comes tonight


peace on earth will come to all
if we just follow the light
let's give thanks to the lord above
'cause santa clause comes tonight
'cause santa clause comes tonight
let's give thanks to the lord above
'cause santa clause comes tonight
tonight, tonight
