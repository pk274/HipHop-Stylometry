yes, the gal i got
i swear she’s the screaming end
she wants me to be a hero
so she can tell all her friends


well, she begged, she cried
she pleaded with me all last night
well, she begged, she cried
she pleaded with me all last night
she wants me to go out
and find somebody to fight


she reads too many books
she got new movies inside her head
she reads too many books
she got movies inside her head
she wants me to walk out running
she wants me to crawl back dead


you need a different kinda man, babe
one that can grab and hold your heart
need a different kind of man, babe
one that can hold and grab your heart
you need a different kind of man, babe
you need napoleon boneeparte


well, when i’m dead
no more good times will i crave
when i’m dead
no more good times will i crave
you can stand and shout hero
all over my lonesome grave
