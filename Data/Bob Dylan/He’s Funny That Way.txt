once he dressed in silks and lace
and owned a rolls royce car
now he seems quite out of place
like a fallen star

race around my kitchen sink
happy as can be
i'll just have to stop and think
why he fell for me


i'm not much to look at
nothing to see
just glad i'm living
and lucky to be
i've got a man crazy for me
he's funny that way

i can't save a dollar
ain't worth a cent
he'd never hollar
he'd live in a tent
i've got a man crazy for me
he's funny that way


though he'd love to work
and slave for me everyday
he'd be so much better off
if i went away


but why should i leave him?
why should i go?
he'd be unhappy without me, i know
i've got a man crazy for me
he's funny that way


i can see no other way
and no better plan
than to end it all and let him go
to some other man

when i hurt his feelings once in a while
his only answer is one little smile
i got a man crazy for me
he's funny that way
