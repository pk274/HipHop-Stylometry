highway 51 runs right by my baby's door
highway 51 runs right by my baby's door
if i don't get the girl i'm loving
won't go down to highway 51 no more


well, i know that highway like i know my hand
yes, i know that highway like i know the back of my hand
running from up wisconsin way down to no man's land

well, if i should die before my time should come
and if i should die before my time should come
won't you bury my body out on the highway 51


highway 51 runs right by my baby's door
highway 51 runs right by my baby's door
if i don't get the girl i'm loving
won't go down to highway 51 no more
