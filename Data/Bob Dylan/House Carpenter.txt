well met, well met, my own true love
well met, well met, cried she
i've just returned from the salt, salt sea
and it's all for the love of thee


i could have married a king's daughter there
she would have married me
but i have forsaken my king's daughter there
it's all for the love of thee


well, if you could have married a king's daughter there
i'm sure you're the one to blame
for i am married to a house carpenter
and i'm sure he's a fine young man


forsake, forsake your house carpenter
and come away with me
i'll take you where the green grass grows
on the shores of sunny italy


so up she picked her babies three
and gave them kisses, one, two, three
saying "take good care of your daddy while i'm gone
and keep him good company."


well, they were sailing about two weeks
i'm sure it was not three
when the younger of the girls, she came on deck
saying she wants company


"well, are you weeping for your house and home?
or are you weeping for your babies three?"
"well, i'm not weeping for my house carpenter
i'm weeping for my babies three."


oh what are those hills yonder, my love
they look as white as snow
those are the hill of heaven, my love
you and i'll never know


oh what are those hills yonder, my love
they look as dark as night
those are the hills of hellfire my love
where you and i will unite


oh twice around went the gallant ship
i'm sure it was not three
when the ship all of a sudden, it sprung a leak
and it drifted to the bottom of the sea
