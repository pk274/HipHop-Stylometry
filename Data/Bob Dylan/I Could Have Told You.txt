i could have told you she'd hurt you
she'd you love you awhile then desert you
if only you'd asked
i could have told you so


i could have saved you some crying
yes, i could have told you she's lying
but you were in love
and didn't want to know


i hear her now
as i toss and turn and try to sleep
i hear her now
making promises she'll never keep

and soon, it's over and done with
she'll find someone new to have fun with
through all of my tears
i could have told you so


i hear her now
as i toss and turn and try to sleep
i hear her now
making promises she'll never keep

and soon, it's over and done with
she'll find someone new to have fun with
through all of my tears
i could have told you so
