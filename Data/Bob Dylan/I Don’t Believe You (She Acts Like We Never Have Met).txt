i can't understand, she let go of my hand
and left me here facing the wall
i’d sure like to know why she'd go
but i can't get close to her at all

though we kissed through the wild blazing nighttime
she said she would never forget
but now morning’s clear, it’s like i ain't here
she acts like we never met


it’s all new to me, like some mystery
it could even be like a myth
but it’s hard to think on that she’s the same one
that last night i was with

from darkness, dreams are deserted
am i still dreaming yet?
i wish she’d unlock her voice once and talk
'stead of actin' like we never have met


if she ain't feelin' well, then why don’t she tell
'stead of turnin' her back to my face?
without any doubt, she seems too far out
for me to return to or chase

well her skirt it swayed as the guitar played
her mouth was watery and wet
but now something has changed, for she ain't the same
she just acts like we never have met


if i didn’t have to guess, i’d gladly confess
to anything i might’ve tried
if i was with her too long or have done something wrong
i'd wish she’d tell me what it is, i’ll run and hide

though the night ran swirling and whirling
i remember her whispering yet
but evidently she don’t, evidently she won’t
she just acts like we never have met


i’m leavin' today, i’ll be on my way
of this i can't say very much
but if you want me to, i can be just like you
and pretend that we never have touched

and if anybody asks me
“is it easy to forget?”
i’ll say, “it’s easily done, you just pick anyone
and pretend that you never have met!”
