i forgot more than you'll ever know about her


you think you know the smile on her lips
the thrill and the touch of her fingertips
but i forgot more than you'll ever know about her


you think you'll find heaven of bliss
in each caress, in each tender kiss
but i forgot more than you'll ever know about her


you stole her love from me one day
you didn't care how it hurt me
but you can never steal away memories of what used to be


you think she's yours, to have and to hold
someday you'll learn, when her love grows cold
but i forgot more than you'll ever know about her
