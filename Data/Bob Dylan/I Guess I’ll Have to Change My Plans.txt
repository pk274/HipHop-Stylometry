i guess i'll have to change my plan
i should have realized there'd be another man
i overlooked that point completely
until the big affair began


before i knew where i was at
i found myself upon the shelf and that was that
i tried to reach the moon but when i got there
all that i could get was the air


my feet are back upon the ground
i lost the one girl that i'd found


i guess i'll have to change my plan
i should have realized there'd be another man
why did i buy those blue pajamas
before that big affair began?


my boiling point is much too low
for me to try to be a fly lothario
i think i'll crawl right back and into my shell
dwelling in my personal hell


i'll have to change my pattern 'round
i've lost the one girl that i'd found
yes, the one girl
the one girl that i found
