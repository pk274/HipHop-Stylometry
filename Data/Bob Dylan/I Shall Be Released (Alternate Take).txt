they say ev’rything can be replaced
yet ev’ry distance is not near
so i remember ev’ry face
of ev’ry man who put me here


i see my light come shining
from the west unto the east
any day now, any day now
i shall be released


they say ev’ry man needs protection
they say ev’ry man must fall
yet i swear i see my reflection
some place so high above this wall


i see my light come shining
from the west unto the east
any day now, any day now
i shall be released


standing next to me in this lonely crowd
is a man who swears he’s not to blame
all day long i hear him shout so loud
crying out that he was framed


i see my light come shining
from the west unto the east
any day now, any day now
i shall be released
