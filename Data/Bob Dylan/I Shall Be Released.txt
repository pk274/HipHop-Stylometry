they say every man must need protection
they say every man must fall
yet i swear i see my reflection
some place so high above the wall


i see my light come shining
from the west down to the east
any day now, any day now
i shall be released


down here next to me in this lonely crowd
there's a man who swears he's not to blame
all day long i hear him cry so loud
calling out that he's been framed
yeah


i see my light come shining
from the west down to the east
any day now, any day now
i shall be released
