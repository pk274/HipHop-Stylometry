i once held her in my arms
she said she would always stay
but i was cruel, i treated her like a fool
i threw it all away


once i had mountains in the palm of my hand
and rivers that ran through every day
i must have been mad, i never knew what i had
until i threw it all away


love is all there is, it makes the world go 'round
love and only love, it can't be denied
no matter what you think about it
you just won't be able to do without it
take a tip from one who's tried


so if you find someone who gives you all of her love
take it to your heart, don't let it stray
for one thing for certain, you will surely be a-hurtin'
if you throw it all away
if you throw it all away
