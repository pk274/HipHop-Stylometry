i was young when i left home
but i been out a-rambling around
and i never wrote a letter to my home
to my home, lord, to my home
and i never wrote a letter to my home


it was just the other day
i was bringing home my pay
when i met an old friend i used to know


said your mother’s dead and gone
baby sister’s all gone wrong
and your daddy needs you home right away


not a shirt on my back
not a penny on my name
well i can’t go home thisaway
thisaway, lord, lord, lord
and i can’t go home thisaway


if you miss the train i’m on
count the days i’m gone
you will hear that whistle blow a hundred miles
a hundred miles, honey baby. lord lord lord
and you’ll hear that whistle blow a hundred miles


i’m playing on a track
ma would come and whoop me back
on them trestles down by old jim mckay’s


when i pay the debt i owe
to the commissary store
i will pawn my watch and chain and go home
go home, lord lord lord
i will pawn my watch and chain and go home


used to tell ma sometimes
when i see them riding blinds
going to make me a home out in the wind
in the wind, lord in the wind
make me a home out in the wind


i don’t like it in the wind
want to go back home again
but i can’t go home thisaway
thisaway, lord lord lord
and i can’t go home thisaway
