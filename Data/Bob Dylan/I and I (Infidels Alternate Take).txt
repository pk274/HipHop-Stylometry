been so long since a strange woman has slept in my bed
look how sweet she sleeps, how free must be her dreams
in another lifetime she must have owned the world or been faithfully wed
to some righteous king who wrote psalms beside moonlit streams


i and i
in creation where one’s nature neither honors nor forgives
i and i
one says to the other, no man sees my face and lives


think i’ll go out and go for a walk
not much happening, i got someone to see
besides, if she wakes up now, she’ll just want me to talk
i got nothing to say, specially about what could or could not be


i and i
in creation where one’s nature neither honors nor forgives
i and i
one says to the other, no man sees my face and lives


i took an untrodden path once, where the swift didn't win the race
it went to the worthy, who can divide the word of truth
took a stranger to teach me, to look into justice’s face
and to see an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth


i and i
in creation where one’s nature neither honors nor forgives
i and i
one says to the other, no man sees my face and lives


outside of two men on a train platform there’s nobody in sight
they’re waiting for spring to come, smoking down the track
the world could come to an end tonight, but that’s all right
she should still be there sleepin’ when i get back


i and i
in creation where one’s nature neither honors nor forgives
i and i
one says to the other, no man sees my face and lives


it's noontime and i’m still pushing myself along the road on the darkest part
into the narrow lanes, i can’t stumble or stay put
someone else is speaking with my mouth, but i’m listening only to my heart
i’ve made shoes for everyone, even you, while i still go barefoot


i and i
in creation where one’s nature neither honors nor forgives
i and i
one says to the other, no man sees my face and lives
