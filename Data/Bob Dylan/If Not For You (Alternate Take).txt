if not for you
babe, i couldn't find the door
couldn't even see the floor
i'd be sad and blue
if not for you


if not for you
the night would see me wide awake
the day would surely have to break
but it would not be new
if not for you


if not for you my sky would fall
rain would gather too
without your love i'd be nowhere at all
i'd be lost, if not for you


if not for you
the winter would hold no spring
i couldn't hear the robin sing
i just wouldn't have a clue
if not for you
