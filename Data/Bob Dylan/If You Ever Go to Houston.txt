if you ever go to houston
better walk right
keep your hands in your pockets
and your gun-belt tight
you'll be asking for trouble
if you're looking for a fight
if you ever go to houston
boy, you better walk right


if you're ever down there
on bagby and lamar
you better watch out for
the man with the shining star
better know where you're going
or stay where you are
if you're ever down there
on bagby and lamar


i know these streets
i've been here before
i nearly got killed here
during the mexican war
something always
keeps me coming back for more
i know these streets
i've been here before


if you ever go to dallas
say hello to mary anne
say i'm still pulling on the trigger
hanging on the best i can
if you see her sister lucy
say i'm sorry i'm not there
tell her other sister betsy
to pray the sinner's prayer


i got a restless fever
burning in my brain
got to keep riding forward
can't spoil the game
the same way i leave here
will be the way that i came
got a restless fever
burning in my brain


mr. policeman
can you help me find my girl
last time i saw her
was at the magnolia hotel
if you help me find her
you can be my pal
mr. policeman
can you help me find my girl


if you ever go to austin
fort worth or san antone
find the bar rooms i got lost in
and send my memories home
put my tears in a bottle
screw the top on tight
if you ever go to houston
you better walk right
