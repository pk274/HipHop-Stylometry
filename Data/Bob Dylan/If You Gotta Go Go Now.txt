listen to me, baby
there’s something you must see
i want to be with you, gal
if you want to be with me


but if you got to go
it’s all right
but if you got to go, go now
or else you got to stay all night


it am not that i’m questioning you
to take part in any quiz
it’s just that i have got no watch
and you keep asking me what time it is




i am just a poor boy, baby
looking to connect
but i certainly don’t want you thinking
that i have not got any respect




you know i’d have nightmares
and a guilty conscience, too
if i kept you from anything
that you really wanted to do




it ain't that i’m wanting
anything you never gave before
it’s just that i’ll be sleeping soon
it’ll be too dark for you to find the door
