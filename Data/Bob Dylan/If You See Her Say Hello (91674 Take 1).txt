if you see her say hello she might be in tangier
she left here last early spring, is living there i hear
say for me that i'm alright, though new things come and go
she might think that i’ve forgotten her, don't tell her it isn't so


we had a fallin’ out, like lovers often will
but to think of how she left that night, it still brings me a chill
and though our separation it pierced me to the heart
she still lives inside of me, we've never been apart


if you're making love to her, kiss her for the kid
who always has respected her for doing what she did
oh, i know it had to be that way, it was written in the cards
still the bitter taste still lingers on, it all came down so hard


i see a lot of people as i make the rounds
and i hear her name both here and there as i go from town to town
and i've never gotten used to it, i've just learned to turn it off
either i'm too sensitive, or else i'm getting soft


sundown, yellow moon, i replay the past
i know every scene by heart, they all went by so fast
if she's passing back this way, i’m not that hard to find
tell her she can look me up, if she’s got the time
