if you see her, say hello, she might be in tangier
she left here last early spring, is livin' there, i hear
say for me that i'm all right though things get kind of slow
she might think that i've forgotten her, don't tell her it isn't so


we had a falling out, like lovers often will
and to think of how she left that night, it still brings me a chill
and though our separation, it pierced me to the heart
she still lives inside of me, we've never been apart


if you get close to her, kiss her once for me
always have respected her for doing what she did and gettin' free
oh, whatever makes her happy, i won't stand in the way
though the bitter taste still lingers on from the night i tried to make her stay


i see a lot of people as i make the rounds
and i hear her name here and there as i go from town to town
and i've never gotten used to it, i've just learned to turn it off
either i'm too sensitive or else i'm gettin' soft


sundown, yellow moon, i replay the past
i know every scene by heart, they all went by so fast
if she's passin' back this way, i'm not that hard to find
tell her she can look me up if she's got the time
