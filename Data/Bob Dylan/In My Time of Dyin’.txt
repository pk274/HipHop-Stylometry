well, in my time of dying don't want nobody to mourn
all i want for you to do is take my body home
well, well, well, so i can die easy
well, well, well
well, well, well, so i can die easy
jesus going to make up, jesus going to make up
jesus going to make up my dying bed


well, meet me jesus, meet me, meet me
in the middle of the air
if these wings should fail me
lord, won't you meet me with another pair
well, well, well, so i can die easy
well, well, well
well, well, well, so i can die easy
jesus going to make up, jesus going to make up
jesus going to make up my dying bed


lord, in my time of dying don't want nobody to cry
all i want you to do is take me when i die
well, well, well, so i can die easy
well, well, well
well, well, well, so i can die easy
jesus going to make up, jesus going to make up
jesus going to make up my dying bed
