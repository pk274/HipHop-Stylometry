went out last night just to take a little round
i met my little sadie and i brought her down
i ran right home and i went to bed
with a .44 smokeless under my head


i began to think what a deed i done
i grabbed my head and i began to run
i made a good run but i run too slow
they overtook me down in jericho


standinâ€™ on the corner as he's ringin' my bell
up stepped the sheriff of thomasville
he says, "young man is your name brown?
remember you blowed little sadie down?"


"oh, yes sir my name is lee
i murdered little sadie in first degree"
"first degree and second degree
if you got any papers, will you serve them to me."


well they took me downtown and they dressed me in black
they put me on a train and they sent me back
i had no one for to go my bail
they crammed me back into the county jail
oh yes they did


now the judge and the jury they took their stand
the judge had the papers in his right hand
forty-one days, forty-one nights
forty-one years with the ball and stripes, oh no


went out last night to take a little round
i met my little sadie and i blowed her down
i run right home and i went to bed
a .44 smokeless under my head
