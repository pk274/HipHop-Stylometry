do you love me
or are you just extending goodwill?
do you need me half as bad as you say
or are you just feeling guilt?


i’ve been burned before and i know the score
so you won’t hear me complain
will i be able to count on you
or is your love in vain?


are you so fast that you cannot see
that i must have solitude?
when i am in the darkness
why do you intrude?


do you know my world, do you know my kind
or must i explain?
will you let me be myself
or is your love in vain?


well i’ve been to the mountain and i’ve been in the wind
i’ve been in and out of happiness
i have dined with kings, i’ve been offered wings
and i’ve never been too impressed


all right, i’ll take a chance
i will fall in love with you
if i’m a fool you can have the night
you can have the morning too


can you cook and sew, make flowers grow
do you understand my pain?
are you willing to risk it all
or is your love in vain?


can you cook and sew, make flowers grow
