i married isis on the fifth day of may
but i could not hold on to her very long
so i cut off my hair and i rode straight away
for the wild unknown country where i could not go wrong


i came to a high place of darkness and light
dividing line ran through the center of town
i hitched up my pony to a post on the right
went in to a laundry to wash my clothes down


a man in the corner approached me for a match
i knew right away, he was not ordinary
he said “are you looking for something easy to catch?”
said “i got no money”
he said “that ain't necessary”


we set out that night, for the cold in the north
i gave him my blanket, and he gave me his word
i said “where are we going?” he said we’d be back by the fourth
i said “that’s the best news that i’ve ever heard”


i was thinking about turquoise, i was thinking about gold
i was thinking about diamonds, and the world’s biggest necklace
as we rode through the canyons, through the devilish cold
i was thinking about isis, how she thought i was so reckless


how she told me that one day we would meet up again
and things would be different the next time we wed
if i only could hang on and just be her friend
i still can’t remember all the best things she said


we came to the pyramids, all embedded in ice
he said “there’s a body i’m trying to find
if i carry it out it’ll bring a good price”
'twas then that i knew what he had on his mind


the wind it was a-howlin', and the snow was outrageous
we chopped through the night
and we chopped through the dawn
when he died, i was hopin' that it wasn’t contagious
but i made up my mind that i had to go on


i broke into the tomb, but the casket was empty
there was no jewels, no nothing! i felt i’d been had
when i saw that my partner was just being friendly
when i took up his offer i must have been mad


i picked up his body and i dragged him inside
threw him down in the hole, and i put back the cover
i said a quick prayer, then i felt satisfied
then i rode back to find isis, just to tell her i love her


she was there, in the meadow, where the creek used to rise
blinded by sleep, and in need of a bed
i came in from the east, with the sun in my eyes
i cursed her one time, then i rode on ahead


she said “where you been?”
i said “no place special”
she said “you look different”
i said “well... i guess”
she said “you been gone”
i said “that’s only natural”
she said “you going to stay?”
i said “if you want me to, yes"


isis, oh, isis, you mystical child
what drives me to you is what drives me insane
i still can remember the way that you smiled
on the fifth day of may in the drizzling rain
