why do i do just as you say?
why must i just give you your way?
why do i sigh, why don't i try to forget?


it must have been that something lovers call fate
kept me saying, "i have to wait"
i saw them all, just couldn't fall 'til we met


it had to be you
it had to be you
i wandered around and finally found the somebody who
could make me be true, could make me be blue
and even be glad, just to be sad thinking of you


some others i've seen might never be mean
might never be cross
or try to be boss
but they wouldn't do


for nobody else gave me a thrill
with all your faults i love you still
it had to be you, wonderful you
it had to be you


for nobody else gave me a thrill
with all your faults i love you still
it had to be you, wonderful you
it had to be you
