so run here baby, put your little hands in mine
i've got something to tell you
i know you're gonna change your mind
when things go wrong, so wrong with you
it hurts me too


i want you, baby, just to understand
i don't wanna be your boss, babe
i just wanna be your man
when things go wrong, so wrong with you
it hurts me too


now when you go home, you don't have to get along
come back to me, baby
where i live, that's where you belong
when things go wrong, so wrong with you
it hurts me too


i love you baby, and you know that it's true
i wouldn't mistreat you, baby
nothing in this world is like you
when things go wrong, so wrong with you
it hurts me too
yes, when things go wrong, so wrong with you
it hurts me too


so run here baby, put your little hand in mine
i got something to tell you, baby
i know that will change your mind
when things go wrong, so wrong with you
don't you know it, don't you know it hurts me too
