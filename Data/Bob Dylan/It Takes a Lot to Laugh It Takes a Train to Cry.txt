well, i ride on a mail train, baby
can't buy a thrill
well, i been up all night
leanin' on the windowsill
well, if i die
on top of the hill
and if i don’t make it
you know my baby will


don't the moon look good, mama
shining through the trees?
don't the brakeman look good, mama
flaggin' down the “double e?”
don't the sun look good
goin' down over the sea?
but don’t my gal look fine
when she's comin' after me?


now the wintertime is coming
the windows are filled with frost
i went to tell everybody
but i could not get across
well, i want to be your lover, baby
i don’t want to be your boss
don’t say i never warned you
when your train gets lost
