talk about me babe, if you must
throw on the dirt, pile on the dust
i'd do the same thing if i could
you know what they say, they say it's all good
all good
it's all good


big politician telling lies
restaurant kitchen, all full of flies
don't make a bit of difference, don't see why it should
but it's all right, 'cause it's all good
it's all good
it's all good


wives are leaving'their husbands, they are beginning to roam
they leave the party and they never get home
i wouldn't change it, even if i could
you know what they say man, it's all good
it's all good
all good


brick by brick, they tear you down
a teacup of water is enough to drown
you ought to know, if they could they would
whatever going down, it's all good
all good
say it's all good


people in the country, people on the land
some of them so sick, they can hardly stand
everybody would move away, if they could
it's hard to believe but it's all good
yeah


the widow's cry, the orphan's plea
everywhere you look, more misery
come along with me, babe, i wish you would
you know what i'm saying, it's all good
all good
i said it's all good
all good
