well, you must leave now, take what you need, you think will last
but whatever you wish to keep, you better grab it fast
yonder stands your orphan with his gun
crying like a fire in the sun


look out, the saints are coming through
and it's all over now, baby blue


well, the highway is for gamblers, better use your sense
take what you have gathered from coincidence
the empty-handed painter from your streets
is drawing crazy patterns on your sheets


the sky, too, is folding over you
yes, and it's all over now, baby blue


all your seasick sailors, they'rе all rowing home
all your empty armies, thеy're all going home
the lover who has just walked out the door
has taken all his blankets from the floor


the carpet, too, is moving under you
yes, and it's all over now, baby blue


leave your stepping stones behind, something calls for you
forget the dead you've left, they will not follow you
the vagabond who's rapping at your door
is standing in the clothes that you once wore


strike another match, go start anew
yes, and it's all over now, baby blue
