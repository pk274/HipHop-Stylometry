shut the light, shut the door
don't have to worry anymore


shut the light, shut the shade
you don't have to be afraid


well, that mockingbird is gonna sail away
we're gonna let it
that big, fat moon gonna shine like a spoon
and we're gonna let it and you won't regret it


kick your shoes off, have no fear
bring that bottle over here


well, that mockingbird gonna sail away
we're gonna let it
that big, fat moon gonna shine like a spoon
we're gonna let it, you won't regret it


kick your shoes off, havе no fear
bring that bottle over hеre
