close your eyes, close the door
ya' don’t have to worry anymore
i’ll be your baby tonight


shut the light, shut the shade
ya' don’t have to be afraid
i’ll be your baby tonight


well, that mockingbird’s gonna sail away
we’re gonna forget it
that big, fat moon is gonna shine like a spoon
but we’re gonna let it
you won’t regret it


kick your shoes off, do not fear
bring that bottle over here
i’ll be your baby tonight
