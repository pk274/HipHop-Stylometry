you will search, babe
at any cost
but how long, babe
can you search for what is not lost?

everybody will help you
some people are very kind
but if i can save you any time
come on, give it to me
i'll keep it with mine


i can't help it
if you might think i am odd
if i say i'm loving you not for what you are
but for what you're not

everybody will help you
discover what you set out to find
but if i can save you any time
come on, give it to me
i'll keep it with mine


the train leaves
at half past ten
but it will be back
in the same old spot again

the conductor
he's still stuck on the line
and if i can save you any time
come on, give it to me
iâ€™ll keep it with mine
