i'll remember you
when i've forgotten all the rest
you to me were true
you to me were the best
when there is no more
you cut to the core
quicker than anyone i knew
when i'm all alone
in the great unknown
i'll remember you


i'll remember you
at the end of the trail
i had so much left to do
i had so little time to fail
there's some people that
you don't forget
even though you've only seen 'em one time or two
when the roses fade
and i'm in the shade
i'll remember you


didn't i, didn't i try to love you?
didn't i, didn't i try to care?
didn't i sleep, didn't i weep beside you
with the rain blowing in your hair?


i'll remember you
when the wind blows through the piney wood
it was you who came right through
it was you who understood
though i'd never say
that i done it the way
that you'd have liked me to
when it all is done
and there ain't no one
i'll remember you
