jesus met the woman at the well
and he told her, everything that she'd done, that she'd done


and he said, woman, look-a here woman
tell me where is your husband?
she said whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, i don't have one


he said, woman, look-a here woman
they tell me you have five husbands
and that man you have now sure ain't one


she went running, crying, god help mе
she said whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, you must be the prophеt
she said whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, you must be the prophet
because you told me everything that i've done, that i've done
