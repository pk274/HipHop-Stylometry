john wesley harding
was a friend to the poor
he traveled a'with a gun in ev'ry hand
all along this countryside
he opened a'many a door
but he was never known
to hurt an honest man


’twas down in chaynee county
a time they talk about
with his lady by his side
he took a stand
and soon the situation there
was all but straightened out
for he was always known
to lend a helping hand


all across the telegraph
his name it did resound
but no charge held against him
could they prove
and there was no man around
who could track or chain him down
he was never known
to make a foolish move
