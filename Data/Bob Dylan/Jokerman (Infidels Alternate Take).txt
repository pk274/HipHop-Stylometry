standing on the waters casting your bread
while the eyes of the idol with the iron head are glowing
distant ships sailing into the mist
you were born with a snake in both of your fists while a hurricane was blowing
freedom just around the corner for you
but with the truth so far off, what good will it do?


jokerman dance to the nightingale tune
bird fly high by the light of the moon
oh, oh-oh jokerman


so swiftly the sun sets in the sky
you rise up and say goodbye to no one
no store bought shirt for you on your back
one of the women must sit in the shack and sew one
shedding off one more layer of skin
keeping one step ahead of the persecutor within


jokerman dance to the nightingale tune
bird fly high by the light of the moon
oh, oh-oh jokerman


you're a man of the mountains, you can walk on the clouds
manipulator of crowds, you're a dream twister
you're going to sodom and gomorrah, but what do you care?
ain't nobody there would want to marry your sister
scratching the world with a fine-toothed comb
you're a king among nations, you're a stranger at home


jokerman dance to the nightingale tune
bird fly high by the light of the moon
oh, oh, oh, jokerman


now, the book of leviticus and deuteronomy
the law of the jungle and the sea are your only teachers
no crystal ball do you need on your shelf
michelangelo himself, could've carved out your features
so drunk, standing in the middle of the street
directing traffic with a small dog licking your feet


jokerman dance to the nightingale tune
bird fly high by the light of the moon
oh, oh-oh jokerman


well, the preacher man talking about the deaf and the dumb
and a world to come, thats already been pre-determined
nightsticks and water cannons, tear gas, and padlocks
molotov cocktails and rocks can't drown out his sermon
you let the wicked walk right into a trap
you give away all the good things that fall in your lap


jokerman dance to the nightingale tune
bird fly high by the light of the moon
oh, oh-oh jokerman


it's a shadowy world, skies are slippery gray
a woman just give birth to a prince today and she's dressed in scarlet
he'll turn priests into pimps and make old men bark
take a woman who could have been joan-of-arc and turn her into a harlot
oh, jokerman, you know what he wants
oh, jokerman, you don't show any response


jokerman dance to the nightingale tune
bird fly high by the light of the moon
oh, oh, oh, jokerman
