well you're coming down high street, walking in the sun
you make the dead man rise, and holler she's the one
jolene, jolene
baby, i am the king and you're the queen


well it's a long old highway, don't ever end
i've got a saturday night special, i'm back again
i'll sleep by your door, lay my life on the line
you probably don't know, but i'm going to make you mine
jolene, jolene
baby, i am the king and you're the queen


i keep my hands in my pocket, i'm moving along
people think they know, but they're all wrong
you're something nice, i'm going to grab my dice
i can't say i haven't paid the price
jolene, jolene
baby i am the king and you're the queen


well i found out the hard way, i've had my fill
you can't find somebody with his back to a hill
those big brown eyes, they set off a spark
when you hold me in your arms things don't look so dark
jolene, jolene
baby i am the king and you're the queen
