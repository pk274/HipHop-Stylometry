when you're lost in the rain in juarez
and it's easter time too
and your gravity fails
negativity don't pull you through
don't put on any airs
when you're down on rue morgue avenue
they got some hungry women there
and they really make a mess outta you


if you see saint annie
please tell her thanks a lot
i can't move too good
my fingers are all in a knot
i don't have the strength
to get up and take another shot
and my best friend, the doctor
won't even tell me what it is i've got


sweet melinda
peasants call her the goddess of the gloom
she speaks good english
invites you up into her room
and you're so kind
and careful not to go to her too soon
and she takes your voice
and leaves you howling at the moon


up on housing project hill
it's either fortune or fame
you must pick one or the other
neither of them are what they claim
if you're lookin' to get silly
you better go back to from where you came
because the cops don't need you
and, man, they expect the same


all the authorities
they just stand around and boast
how they blackmailed the sergeant-at-arms
getting up and leaving his post
and picking up angel
who just arrived from the coast
who looked so fine at first
but left lookin' just like a ghost


i started out on burgundy
but soon hit the harder stuff
everybody said they'd right behind me
when the game got rough
but the joke was on me
there was nobody even there to call my bluff
i'm going back to new york city
i do believe i've had enough
