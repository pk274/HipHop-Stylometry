the winter wind is a blowing strong
my hands have got no gloves
i wish to my soul that i could see
the girl i'm a-thinking of


don't you remember me babe
i remember you quite well
you caused me to leave old kingsport town
with a high sheriff on my trail


high sheriff on my trail, boys
high sheriff on my trail
all because i'm falling for
a curly-headed dark-eyed girl


who's a-gonna stroke your cold black hair
and sandy colored skin
who's a-gonna kiss your memphis lips
when i'm out in the wind
when i'm out in the wind, babe
when i'm out in the wind
who's a-gonna kiss your memphis mouth
when i'm out in the wind


who's a-gonna walk you side by side
and tell you everything's alright
who's a-gonna sing to you all day long
and not just in the night
who's a-gonna walk you side by side
who's a-gonna be your man
who's a-gonna look you straight in the eye
and hold your bad luck hand


hold your bad luck hand, babe
hold your bad luck hand
who's a-gonna hold your hard luck hand
and who's a-gonna be your man


the winter wind is a blowing strong
my hands have got no gloves
i wish to my soul i could see
the girl i'm a-thinking of
