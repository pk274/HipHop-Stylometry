lay down your weary tune, lay down
lay down the song you strum
and rest yourself 'neath the strength of strings
no voice can hope to hum


struck by the sounds before the sun
i knew the night had gone
the morning breeze like a bugle blew
against the drums of dawn


lay down your weary tune, lay down
lay down the song you strum
and rest yourself 'neath the strength of strings
no voice can hope to hum


the ocean wild like an organ played
the seaweed's wove its strands
the crashing waves like cymbals clashed
against the rocks and sands


lay down your weary tune, lay down
lay down the song you strum
and rest yourself 'neath the strength of strings
no voice can hope to hum


i stood unwound beneath the skies
and clouds unbound by laws
the crying rain like a trumpet sang
and asked for no applause


lay down your weary tune, lay down
lay down the song you strum
and rest yourself 'neath the strength of strings
no voice can hope to hum


the last of leaves fell from the trees
and clung to a new love's breast
the branches bare like a banjo played
to the winds that listened best


lay down your weary tune, lay down
lay down the song you strum
and rest yourself 'neath the strength of strings
no voice can hope to hum
