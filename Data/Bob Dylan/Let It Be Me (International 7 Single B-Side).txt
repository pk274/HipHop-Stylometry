i bless the day i found you
i want my arms around you
and so i beg you: let it be me


don't take this heaven from one
if you must cling to someone
now and forever, let it be me


each time we meet, love
i find complete love
without your sweet love, what would life be?


so never leave me lonely
tell me that you love me only
and say you'll always let it be me
