i will not go down under the ground
’cause somebody tells me that death’s coming 'round
an’ i will not carry myself down to die
when i go to my grave my head will be high


there’s been rumors of war and wars that have been
the meaning of life has been lost in the wind
and some people thinking that the end is close by
’stead of learning to live they are learning to die


i don’t know if i’m smart but i think i can see
when someone is pulling the wool over me
and if this war comes and death’s all around
let me die on this land ’fore i die underground


there’s always been people that have to cause fear
they’ve been talking about war now for many long years
i have read all their statements and i’ve not said a word
but now lawd god, let my poor voice be heard


let me drink from the waters where the mountain streams flood
let the smell of wildflowers flow free through my blood
let me sleep in your meadows with the green grassy leaves
let me walk down the highway with my brother in peace


go out in your country where the land meets the sun
see the craters and the canyons where the waterfalls run
nevada, new mexico, arizona, idaho
let every state in this union seep down deep in your souls
and you’ll die in your footsteps
before you go down under the ground
