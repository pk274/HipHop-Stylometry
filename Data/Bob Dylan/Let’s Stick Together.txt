well, a young marriage vow, you know, it's very sacred
the man put us together, now, you wanna make it
stick together
come on, come on, stick together


you know, you made a vow, not to leave one another, never
well, ya never miss you water till your well runs dry
come on, baby, give our love a try, let's stick together
come on, come on, stick together
we made a vow, not to leave one another, never


well, ya never miss your water till your well runs dry
come one, baby, give our love a try, let's stick together
come on, come on, stick together
you know, we made a vow, not to leave one another, never


it might be tough for a while, but consider the child
cannot be happy without his mom and his pappy
let's stick together
come on, come on, stick together
you know, we made a vow, not to leave one another, never
