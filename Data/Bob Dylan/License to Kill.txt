man thinks because he rules the earth he can do with it as he please
and if things don’t change soon, he will
oh, man has invented his doom
first step was touching the moon


now, they take him and they teach him and they groom him for life
and they set him on a path where he’s bound to get ill
then they bury him with stars
sell his body like they do used cars


now, he’s hell-bent for destruction, he’s afraid and confused
and his brain has been mismanaged with great skill
all he believes are his eyes
and his eyes, they just tell him lies


you may be a noisemaker, spirit maker
heartbreaker, backbreaker
leave no stone unturned
may be an actor in a plot
that might be all that you got
till your error you clearly learn


now he worships at an altar of a stagnant pool
and when he sees his reflection, he’s fulfilled
oh, man is opposed to fair play
he wants it all and he wants it his way
