when first i came to louisville
some pleasure there to find
a damsel there from lexington
was pleasing to my mind

her rosy cheeks, her ruby lips
like arrows pierced my breast
and the name she bore was flora
the lily of the west
(and the name she bore was flora)
(the lily of the west)


i courted lovely flora
some pleasure for to find
but she turned unto another man
whose sore distressed my mind

she robbed me of my liberty
deprived me of my rest
then go, my lovely flora
the lily of the west
(then go, my lovely flora)
(the lily of the west)


away down in yonder shady grove
a man of high degree
conversing with my flora there
it seemed so strange to me

and the answer that she gave to him
it sore did me oppressed
i was betrayed by flora
the lily of the west
(i was betrayed by flora)
(the lily of the west)


i stepped up my rival
dagger in my hand
and seized him by the collar
only made him stand

seeing mad by desperation
i pierced him to the breast
all this for lovely flora
the lily of the west
(this for lovely flora)
(the lily of the west)


i had to stand my trial
i had to make my plea
they placed me in the witness box
and then commenced on me

although she swore my life away
deprived me of my rest
still i love my faithless flora
the lily of the west
(still i love my faithless flora)
(the lily of the west)
