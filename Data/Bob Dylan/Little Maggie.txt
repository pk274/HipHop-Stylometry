oh, where is little maggie
over yonder she stands
rifle on her shoulder
six-shooter in her hand
how can i ever stand it
just to see them two blue eyes
shining like some diamonds
like some diamonds in the sky
rather be in some lonely hollow
where the sun don't ever shine
than to see you be another man's darling
and to know that you'll never be mine


well, it's march me away to the station
with my suitcase in my hand
yes, march me away to the station
i'm off to some far distant land


sometimes i have a nickel
and sometimes i have a dime
sometimes i'll have ten dollars
just to pay for little maggie's wine


pretty flowers are made for blooming
pretty stars are made to shine
pretty girls are made for boy's love
little maggie was made for mine


well, yonder stands little maggie
with a dram glass in her hand
she's a-drinking down her troubles
over courting some other man
