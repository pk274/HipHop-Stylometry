since you’ve been gone
i’ve been walking around
with my head bowed down to my shoes
i’ve been living the blues
ev’ry night without you


i don’t have to go far (ah-ah)
to know where you are (ah-ah)
strangers all give me the news
i’ve been living the blues (living the blues)
ev’ry night without you


i think that it’s best
i soon get some rest
and forget my pride
but i can’t deny
this feeling that i
carry for you deep down inside


if you see me this way (ah-ah)
you’d come back and you’d stay (ah-ah)
oh, how could you refuse
i’ve been living the blues (living the blues)
ev’ry night without you


i think that it’s best
i soon get some rest
and forget my pride
but i can’t deny
this feeling that i
carry for you deep down inside


if you see me this way
you’d come back and you’d stay
oh, how could you refuse
i’ve been living the blues (living the blues)
ev’ry night without you


i’ve been living the blues (living the blues)
ev’ry night without you
i’ve been living the blues (living the blues)
ev’ry night without you
