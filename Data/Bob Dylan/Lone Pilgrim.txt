i came to the place where the lone pilgrim lay
and pensively stood by his tomb
when in a low whisper i heard something say:
how sweetly i sleep here alone


the tempest may howl and the loud thunder roar
and gathering storms may arise
but calm is my feeling, at rest is my soul
the tears are all wiped from my eyes


the cause of my master compelled me from home
no kindred or relative nigh
i met the contagion and sank to the tomb
my soul flew to mansions on high


go tell my companion and children most dear
to weep not for me now i'm gone
the same hand that led me through seas most severe
has kindly assisted me home
