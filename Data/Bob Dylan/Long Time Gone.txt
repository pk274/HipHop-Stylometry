my parents raised me tenderly
i was their only son
my mind got mixed with rambling
when i was all so young
and i left my home the first time
when i was twelve and one
i’m a long time a-comin’, maw
an’ i’ll be a long time gone


on the western side of texas
on the texas plains
i tried to find a job o’ work
but they said l’s young of age
my eyes they burned when i heard
“go home where you belong!”
i’m a long time a-comin’
an’ i’ll be a long time gone


i remember when i’s rambling
around with the carnival trains
different towns, different people
somehow they’re all the same
i remember children’s faces best
i remember traveling on
i’m a long time a-comin’
i’ll be a long time gone


i once loved a fair young maid
an’ i ain’t too big to tell
if she broke my heart a single time
she broke it ten or twelve
i walked and talked all by myself
i did not tell no one
i’m a long time a-comin’, babe
an’ i’ll be a long time gone


many times by the highwayside
i tried to flag a ride
with bloodshot eyes and gritting teeth
i’d watch the cars roll by
the empty air hung in my head
i’s thinkin’ all day long
i’m a long time a-comin’
i’ll be a long time gone


you might see me on your crossroads
when i’m a-passin’ through
remember me how you wished to
as i’m a-driftin’ from your view
i ain’t got the time to think about it
i got too much to get done
well, i’m a long time coming
an’ i’ll be a long time gone


if i can’t help somebody
with a word or song
if i can’t show somebody
they are traveling’ wrong
but i know i ain’t no prophet
an’ i ain’t no prophet’s son
i’m just a long time a-comin’
an’ i’ll be a long time gone


so you can have your beauty
it’s skin deep and it only lies
and you can have your youth
it’ll rot before your eyes
just give to me my gravestone
with it clearly carved upon:
“i’s a long time a-comin’
an’ i’ll be a long time gone”
