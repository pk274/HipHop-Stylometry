my love she speaks like silence
without ideals or violence
she doesn't have to say she's faithful
yet she's true, like ice, like fire


people carry roses
and make promises by the hours
my love she laughs like the flowers
valentines can't buy her


in the dime stores and bus stations
people talk of situations
read books, repeat quotations
draw conclusions on the wall


some speak of the future
my love she speaks softly
she knows there's no success like failure
and that failure's no success at all


the cloak and dagger dangles
madams light the candles
in ceremonies of the horsemen
even a pawn must hold a grudge


statues made of match sticks
crumble into one another
my love winks, she does not bother
she knows too much to argue or to judge


the bridge at midnight trembles
the country doctor rambles
bankers' nieces seek perfection
expecting all the gifts that wise men bring


the wind howls like a hammer
the night blows rainy
my love she's like some raven
at my window with a broken wing
