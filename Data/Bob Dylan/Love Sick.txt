i'm walking through streets that are dead
walking, walking with you in my head
my feet are so tired, my brain is so wired
and the clouds are weeping


did i hear someone tell a lie?
did i hear someone's distant cry?
i spoke like a child, you destroyed me with a smile
while i was sleeping


i’m sick of love
but i'm in the thick of it
this kind of love
i'm so sick of it


i see, i see lovers in the meadow
i see, i see silhouettes in the window
i watch them till they're gone and they leave me hanging on
to a shadow


i'm sick of love
i hear the clock tick
this kind of love
i'm lovesick


sometimes the silence can be like the thunder
sometimes i wanna take to the road and plunder
could you ever be true? i think of you
and i wonder


i'm sick of love
i wish i'd never met you
i'm sick of love
i'm trying to forget you


just don’t know what to do
i'd give anything to be with you
