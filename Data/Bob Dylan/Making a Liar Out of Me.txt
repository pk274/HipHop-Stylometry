i tell people you're just goin' through changes
and that you're acquanted both with night and day
that your money's good and you're just being courageous
on them burnin' bridges knowin' your feet are made of clay
well i say you won't be destroyed by your inventions
that you brought it all under captivity
and that you really do have all the best intentions
but you're makin' a liar out of me


well i say that you're just young and self-tormented
but that deep down you understand
the hopes and fears and dreams of the discontented
who threaten now to overtake your promised land
well i say you'd not sow discord among brothers
nor drain a man of his integrity
but you'll remember the cries of orphans and their mothers
but you're makin' a liar out of me
but you're makin' a liar out of me


well i say that, that ain't flesh and blood you're drinkin'
in the wounded empire of your fool's paradise
with a light above your head forever blinkin'
turnin' virgins into merchandise
that you must have been beautiful when you were livin'
you remind me of some old-time used-to-be
i say you can be trusted with the power you been given
but you're makin' a liar out of me


so many things so hard to say as you stumble
to take refuge in your offices of shame
as the earth beneath my feet begins to rumble
and your young men die for nothin' not even fame
i say that someday you'll begin to trust us
and that your conscience not been slain by conformity
that you'll stand up unafraid to believe in justice
but you're makin' a liar out of me
you're makin' a liar out of me


well i can hear the sound of distant thunder
from an open window at the end of every hall
now that you're gone i got to wonder
if you ever were here at all
i say you never sacrificed my children
to some false god of infidelity
and that it's not the tower of babel that you're buildin'
but you're makin' a liar out of me
you're makin' a liar out of me
now you're makin' a liar out of me
