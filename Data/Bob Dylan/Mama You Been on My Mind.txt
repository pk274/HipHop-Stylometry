perhaps it's the color of the sun cut flat
and covering the crossroads i'm standing at
or maybe it's the weather or something like that
but mama, you been on my mind


i don't mean trouble please don't put me down or get upset
i am not pleading, or saying i can't forget you
i do not pace the floor, bowed down and bent, but yet
mama, you been on my mind


even though my eyes are hazy
and my thoughts they might be narrow
where you been don't bother me
or bring me down with sorrow
i don't even mind who you'll be waking with tomorrow
mama, you're just on my mind


i'm not asking you to say words like yes or no
please, understand me, i have no place i'm calling you to go
i'm just whispering to myself so i can't pretend that i don't know
mama, you're on my mind


when you wake up in the morning, baby, look inside your mirror
you know i won't be next to you, you know i won't be near
i'd just be curious to know if you can see yourself as clear
as someone who has had you on his mind
