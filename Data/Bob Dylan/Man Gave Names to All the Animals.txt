man gave names to all the animals
in the beginning, long time ago


he saw an animal that liked to growl
big furry paws and he liked to howl
great big furry back and furry hair
“ah, think i'll call it a bear”


man gave names to all the animals
in the beginning, in the beginning
man gave names to all the animals
in the beginning, long time ago


he saw an animal up on a hill
chewing up so much grass until he was filled
he saw milk coming out but he didn't know how
“ah, think i'll call it a cow”


man gave names to all the animals
in the beginning, in the beginning
man gave names to all the animals

he saw an animal that liked to snort
horns on his head and they weren't too short
it looked like there wasn’t nothing that he couldn't pull
“ah, think i'll call it a bull”

he saw an animal leaving a muddy trail
real dirty face and a curly tail
he wasn't too small and he wasn't too big
“ah, think i'll call it a pig”


man gave names to all the animals
in the beginning, in the beginning
man gave names to all the animals
in the beginning, long time ago


next animal that he did meet
had wool on his back and hooves on his feet
eating grass on a mountainside so steep
“ah, think i'll call it a sheep”


man gave names to all the animals
in the beginning, in the beginning
man gave names to all the animals
in the beginning, long time ago


he saw an animal as smooth as glass
slithering his way through the grass
saw him disappear by a tree near a lake
