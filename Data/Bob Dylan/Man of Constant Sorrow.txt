i am a man of constant sorrow
i've seen trouble all my days
i'll say goodbye to colorado
where i was born and partly raised


your mother says that i'm a stranger
my face you'll never see no more
but there's one promise darling
i'll see you on god's golden shore


through this open world i'm a-bound to ramble
through ice and snow, sleet and rain
i'm a-bound to ride that morning railroad
perhaps i'll die on that train


i'm a-going back to colorado
the place that i've started from
if i'd know-ed how bad you'd treat me
honey, i never would have come
