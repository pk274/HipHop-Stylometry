look out your window, baby, there’s a scene you’d like to catch
the band is playing “dixie,” a man got his hand outstretched
could be the führer
could be the local priest
you know sometimes satan comes as a man of peace


he got a sweet gift of gab, he got a harmonious tongue
he knows every song of love that ever has been sung
good intentions can be evil
both hands can be full of grease
you know that sometimes satan comes as a man of peace


well, first he’s in the background, then he’s in the front
both eyes are looking like they’re on a rabbit hunt
nobody can see through him
no, not even the chief of police
you know that sometimes satan comes as a man of peace


well, he catch you when you’re hoping for a glimpse of the sun
catch you when your troubles feel like they weigh a ton
he could be standing next to you
the person that you’d notice least
i hear that sometimes satan comes as a man of peace


well, he can be fascinating, he can be dull
he can ride down niagara falls in the barrels of your skull
i can smell something cooking
i can tell there’s going to be a feast
you know that sometimes satan comes as a man of peace


he’s a great humanitarian, he’s a great philanthropist
he knows just where to touch you, honey, and how you like to be kissed
he’ll put both his arms around you
you can feel the tender touch of the beast
you know that sometimes satan comes as a man of peace


well, the howling wolf will howl tonight, the king snake will crawl
trees that’ve stood for a thousand years suddenly will fall
want to get married? do it now
tomorrow all activity will cease
you know that sometimes satan comes as a man of peace


somewhere mama’s weeping for her blue-eyed boy
she’s holding them little white shoes and that little broken toy
and he’s following a star
the same one them three men followed from the east
i hear that sometimes satan comes as a man of peace
