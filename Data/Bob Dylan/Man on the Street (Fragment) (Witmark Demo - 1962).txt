well i'll sing you a song, it ain't very long
about an old man, he never done wrong
how he died no one can say
they found him dead in the street one day


well, the crowd, they gathered one fine morn
at the man whose clothes 'n' shoes were torn
there on the sidewalk he did lay
they stopped 'n' stared 'n' they went their way


well, the p'liceman come and he looked around
"get up, old man, or i'm a-takin' you down."
and he jabbed him once with his billy club
the old man then rolled off the curb

well, hmm jesus i just can't get it, i-i lost the verses
