well i'll sing you a song, it ain't very long
about an old man, who never done wrong
how he died nobody can say
they found him dead in the street one day


well, the crowd they gathered one fine morn
at the man whose clothes 'n' shoes were torn
there on the sidewalk he did lay
they stopped 'n' stared 'n' walked their way


well, the policeman come and he looked around
"get up, old man, or i'm a-takin' you down"
he jabbеd him once with his billy club
and the old man then rollеd off the curb


well, he jabbed him again and loudly said
"call the wagon, this man is dead"
the wagon come, they loaded him in
i never saw the man again


well, i've sung you my song, it ain't very long
about an old man who never done wrong
how he died no one can say
they found him dead in the street one day
