snowflakes are falling on my head
lord have mercy, it feel heavy as lead
i've been hit too hard and i've seen too much
nothing can heal me now but your touch


loneliness got a mind of its own
the more people around, more you feel alone
well, i'm chained to the earth like a silent slave
i'm trying to break free out of death's dark cave


boys in the street beginning to play
girls like birds flying away
i'm carrying the roses that were given to me
thinking 'bout paradise, wondering what it might be


clouds in the sky look like rain
tired of talking, time to explain
when i'm gone, you'll remember my name
i'm gonna win my way to wealth and fame


i was hoping that we'd never part
you took the madness out of my heart
i was hoping we could drink from life's clear streams
i was hoping we could dream life's pleasant dreams
