come, you masters of war
you that build the big guns
you that build the death planes
you that build all the bombs
you that hide behind walls
you that hide behind desks
i just want you to know
i can see through your masks


you that never done nothing
but build to destroy
you play with my world
like it’s your little toy
you put a gun in my hand
and you hide from my eyes
and you turn and run farther
when the fast bullets fly
and i hope that you die


and your death will come soon
i'll follow your casket
on a pale afternoon


and i'll watch while you're lowered
unto your deathbed
and i'll stand over your grave
till i'm sure that you're dead
