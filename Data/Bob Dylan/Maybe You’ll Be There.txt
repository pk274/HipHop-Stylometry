each time i see a crowd of people
just like a fool i stop and stare
it's really not the proper thing to do
but maybe you'll be there


i go out walking after midnight
along the lonely thoroughfare
it's not the time or place to look for you
but maybe you'll be there


you said your arms would always hold me
you said your lips were mine alone to kiss
now after all those things you told me
how can it end like this


someday if all my prayers are answered
i'll hear a footstep on the stair
with anxious heart i'll hurry to the door
and maybe you'll be there
