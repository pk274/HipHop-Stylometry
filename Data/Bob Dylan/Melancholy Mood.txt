melancholy mood forever haunts me
steals upon me in the night, forever taunts me
oh, what a lonely soul am i, stranded high and dry
by a melancholy mood


gone is every joy and inspiration
tears are all i have to show, no consolation
all i see is grief and gloom, 'til the crack of doom
oh, melancholy mood


deep in the night i search for a trace
of a lingering kiss, a warm embrace
but love is a whimsy, as flimsy as lace
and my arms embrace an empty space


melancholy mood, why must you blind me
pity me and break the chains, the chains that bind me
won't you release me, set me free, bring her back to me
oh, melancholy mood
