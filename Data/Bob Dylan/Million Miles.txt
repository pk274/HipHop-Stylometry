you took a part of me that i really miss
i keep asking myself how long it can go on like this
you told yourself a lie, that’s all right mama i told myself one too
i’m trying to get closer but i’m still a million miles from you


you took the silver, you took the gold
you left me standing out in the cold
people ask about you, i didn’t tell them everything i knew
well, i’m trying to get closer but i’m still a million miles from you


i’m drifting in and out of dreamless sleep
throwing all my memories in a ditch so deep
did so many things i never did intend to do
well, i’m trying to get closer but i’m still a million miles from you


i need your love so bad, turn your lamp down low
i need every bit of it for the places that i go
sometimes i wonder just what it’s all coming to
well, i’m trying to get closer but i’m still a million miles from you


well, i don’t dare close my eyes and i don’t dare wink
maybe in the next life i’ll be able to hear myself think
feel like talking to somebody but i just don’t know who
well, i’m trying to get closer but i’m still a million miles from you


the last thing you said before you hit the street
“gonna find me a janitor to sweep me off my feet”
i said, “that’s all right mama you  you do what you gotta do”
well, i’m trying to get closer. i’m still a million miles from you


rock me, pretty baby; rock me ’till everything gets real
rock me for a little while; rock me ’till there’s nothing left to feel
and i’ll rock you too
i’m trying to get closer but i’m still a million miles from you


well, there’s voices in the night trying to be heard
i’m sitting here listening to every mind-polluting word
i know plenty of people who would put me up for a day or two
yes, i’m trying to get closer but i’m still a million miles from you
