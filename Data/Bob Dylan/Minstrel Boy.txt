who's gonna let it roll ?
who's gonna throw that minstrel boy a coin ?
who's gonna let it down easy to save his soul ?


oh look, he's driving a long, long time
there he still sits on top of the hill
well aching and jumping with all laid down
with all of them ladies you know he's lonely still
who's gonna throw that minstrel boy a coin ?
who's gonna let it roll ?
who's gonna throw that minstrel boy a coin ?
who's gonna let it down easy to save his soul ?


well knee deep in number, heavy in toil
mighty mockingbird he still has such a heavy load
beneath his boundaries but more if i can tell
with all of these travelling but i'm still on that road
who's gonna throw that minstrel boy a coin ?
who's gonna let it roll ?
who's gonna throw that minstrel boy a coin ?
who's gonna let it down easy to save his soul ?
