every step of the way we walk the line
your days are numbered, so are mine
time is pilin’ up, we struggle and we scrape
we’re all boxed in, nowhere to escape


city’s just a jungle; more games to play
trapped in the heart of it, trying' to get away
i was raised in the country, been workin’ in the town
i been in trouble ever since i set my suitcase down


ain't got nothing' for you, i had nothing' before
don’t evеn have anything for myself anymore
sky's full of firе and the pain's pourin’ down
nothing you can sell me, i’ll see you around


all my powers of expression and thoughts so sublime
they'll never do you justice in reason or rhyme
only one thing that i did wrong
stayed in mississippi a day too long


well, the devil’s in the alley, mule’s kicking' in the stall
say anything you wanna, i have heard it all
i was thinking’ about the things that rosie said
i was dreaming i was sleepin' in rosie’s bed


i was walking through the leaves, falling from the trees
feel like a stranger nobody sees
so many things that we never will undo
i know you’re sorry, i’m sorry too


some people will offer you their hand and some won’t
last night i knew ya, tonight i don’t
i need something strong to distract my mind
i’m gonna look at you ’til my eyes go blind


i got here followin' the southern star
i crossed that river just to be where you are
only one thing i did wrong
stayed in mississippi a day too long


well my ship’s been split to splinters, it’s sinkin' fast
i’m drowning in the poison, got no future, got no past
but my heart is not weary, it’s light and it’s free
i’ve got nothing but affection for all them who’ve sailed with me


everybody movin' if they ain’t already there
everybody got to move somewhere
stick with me baby, anyhow
things should start to get interestin' right about now


my clothes are wet, tight on my skin
not as tight as the corner that i've painted myself in
i know that fortune is waitin’ to be kind
so give me your hand and say you’ll be mine


the emptiness is endless, cold as the clay
you can always come back, but you can’t come back all the way
only one thing i did wrong
stayed in mississippi a day too long
