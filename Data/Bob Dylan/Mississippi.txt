every step of the way we walk the line
your days are numbered, so are mine
time is piling’ up, we struggle and we scrape
we’re all boxed in, nowhere to escape


city’s just a jungle; more games to play
trapped in the heart of it, tryin' to get away
i was raised in the country, i been working’ in the town
i been in trouble ever since i set my suitcase down


got nothing' for you, i had nothin' before
don’t even have anything for myself anymore
sky full of fire, pain pourin’ down
nothing you can sell me, i’ll see you around


all my powers of expression and thoughts so sublime
could never do you justice in reason or rhyme
only one thing i did wrong
stayed in mississippi a day too long


well, the devil’s in the alley, mule’s in the stall
say anything you wanna, i have heard it all
i was thinkin’ 'bout the things that rosie said
i was dreaming i was sleepin' in rosie’s bed


walking through the leaves, falling from the trees
feeling like a stranger nobody sees
so many things that we never will undo
i know you’re sorry; i’m sorry, too


some people will offer you their hand and some won’t
last night i knew you, tonight i don’t
i need something strong to distract my mind
i’m gonna look at you ’til my eyes go blind


well i got here followin' the southern star
i crossed that river just to be where you are
only one thing i did wrong
stayed in mississippi a day too long


well my ship’s been split to splinters and it’s sinkin' fast
i’m drowning in the poison; got no future, got no past
but my heart is not weary, it’s light and it’s free
i’ve got nothing but affection for all those who’ve sailed with me


everybody moving if they ain’t already there
everybody got to move somewhere
stick with me, baby, stick with me anyhow
things should start to get interestin' right about now


my clothes are wet, tight on my skin
not as tight as the corner that i painted myself in
i know that fortune is waitin’ to be kind
so give me your hand and say you’ll be mine


well, the emptiness is endless, cold as the clay
you can always come back, but you can’t come back all the way
only one thing i did wrong
stayed in mississippi a day too long
