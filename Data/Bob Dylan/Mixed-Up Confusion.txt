i got mixed up confusion
man, it’s a-killing me
well, there’s too many people
and they’re all too hard to please


well, my hat’s in my hand
babe, i’m walking down the line
an’ i’m looking for a woman
whose head’s mixed up like mine


well, my head’s full of questions
my temperature’s rising fast
well, i’m looking for some answers
but i don’t know who to ask


but i’m walking and wondering
and my poor feet don’t ever stop
seeing my reflection
i’m hung over, hung down, hung up!
