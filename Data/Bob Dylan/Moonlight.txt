the seasons they are turnin'
and my sad heart is yearnin'
to hear again the songbird’s sweet melodious tone
won't you meet me out in the moonlight alone?


the dusky light, the day is losing
orchids, poppies, black-eyed susan
the earth and sky that melts with flesh and bone
won't you meet me out in the moonlight alone?


the air is thick and heavy
all along the levy
where the geese into the countryside have flown
won’t you meet me out in the moonlight alone?


well, i’m preaching peace and harmony
the blessings of tranquility
yet i know when the time is right to strike
i'll take you 'cross the river dear
you've no need to linger here
i know the kinds of things you like


the clouds are turning crimson
the leaves fall from the limbs and
the branches cast their shadows over stone
won't you meet me out in the moonlight alone?


the boulevards of cypress trees
the masquerade of birds and bees
the petals, pink and white, the wind has blown
won't you meet me out in the moonlight alone?


the trailing moss and mystic glow
the purple blossoms soft as snow
my tears keep flowing to the sea
doctor, lawyer, indian chief
it takes a thief to catch a thief
for whom does the bell toll for, love?
it tolls for you and me


my pulse is running through my palm
the sharp hills are rising from
yellow fields with twisted oaks that groan
won't you meet me out in the moonlight alone?
