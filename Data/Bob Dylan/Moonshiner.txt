i've been a moonshiner
for seventeen long years
i've spent all my money
on whiskey and beer
i go to some hollow
and sit at my still
and if whiskey dont kill me
then i dont know what will


i go to some bar room
and drink with my friends
where the women can't follow
and see what i spend
god bless them pretty women
i wish they was mine
their breath is as sweet
the dew on the vine


let me eat when i am hungry
let me drink when i am dry
a dollar when i am hard up
religion when i die
the whole world's a bottle
and life's but a dram
when the bottle gets empty
it sure ain't worth a damn
