you say you love me
and you're thinkin' of me
but you know you could be wrong
you say you told me
that you wanna hold me
but you know you're not that strong
i just can't do what i done before
i just can't beg you anymore
i'm gonna let you pass
and i'll go last
then time will tell just who has fell
and who's been left behind
when you go your way and i go mine


you say you disturb me
and you don't deserve me
but you know sometimes you lie
you say you're shakin'
and you're always achin'
but you know how hard you try
sometimes it gets so hard to care
it can't be this way everywhere
and i'm gonna let you pass
yes, and i'll go last
then time will tell who has fell
and who's been left behind
when you go your way and i go mine


well the, the judge he holds a grudge
he's gonna call on you
but he's badly built
and he walks on stilts
watch out he don't fall on you


you say you're sorry
for tellin' stories
that you know i believe are true
you say you got some
other kinda lover
and yes, i believe you do
say my kisses are not like his
but this time i'm not gonna tell you why that is
i'm just gonna let you pass
yes, and i'll go last
then time will tell who has fell
and who's been left behind
when you go your way and i go mine
