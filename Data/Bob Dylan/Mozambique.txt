i like to spend some time in mozambique
the sunny sky is aqua blue
and all the couples dancing cheek to cheek
it’s very nice to stay a week or two
and maybe fall in love, just me and you


there’s lot of pretty girls in mozambique
and plenty time for good romance
and everybody likes to stop and speak
to give the special one you seek a chance
or maybe say hello with just a glance


lying next to her by the ocean
reaching out and touching her hand
whispering your secret emotion
magic in a magical land


and when it’s time for leaving mozambique
to say goodbye to sand and sea
you turn around to take a final peek
and you see why it’s so unique to be
among the lovely people living free
upon the beach of sunny mozambique
