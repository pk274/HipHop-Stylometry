'twas a dark day in dallas, november '63
a day that will live on in infamy
president kennedy was a-ridin' high
good day to be livin' and a good day to die
being led to the slaughter like a sacrificial lamb
he said, "wait a minute, boys, you know who i am?"
"of course we do, we know who you are"
then they blew off his head while he was still in the car
shot down like a dog in broad daylight
was a matter of timing and the timing was right
you got unpaid debts, we've come to collect
we're gonna kill you with hatred, without any respect
we'll mock you and shock you and we'll grin in your face
we've already got someone here to take your place
the day they blew out the brains of the king
thousands were watching, no one saw a thing
it happened so quickly, so quick, by surprise
right there in front of everyone's eyes
greatest magic trick ever under the sun
perfectly executed, skillfully done
wolfman, oh wolfman, oh wolfman, howl
rub-a-dub-dub, it's a murder most foul


hush, little children, you'll understand
the beatles are comin', they're gonna hold your hand
slide down the banister, go get your coat
ferry 'cross the mersey and go for the throat
there's three bums comin' all dressed in rags
pick up the pieces and lower the flags
i'm goin' to woodstock, it's the aquarian age
then i'll go over to altamont and sit near the stage
put your head out the window, let the good times roll
there's a party going on behind the grassy knoll
stack up the bricks, pour the cement
don't say dallas don't love you, mr. president
put your foot in the tank and then step on the gas
try to make it to the triple underpass
blackface singer, whiteface clown
better not show your faces after the sun goes down
up in the red light district, like a cop on the beat
living in a nightmare on elm street
when you're down on deep ellum, put your money in your shoe
don't ask what your country can do for you
cash on the barrelhead, money to burn
dealey plaza, make a left-hand turn
i'm going down to the crossroads, gonna flag a ride
the place where faith, hope, and charity died
shoot him while he runs, boy, shoot him while you can
see if you can shoot the invisible man
goodbye, charlie, goodbye, uncle sam
frankly, miss scarlett, i don't give a damn
what is the truth, and where did it go?
ask oswald and ruby, they oughta know
"shut your mouth," said a wise old owl
business is business, and it's a murder most foul


tommy, can you hear me? i'm the acid queen
i'm riding in a long, black lincoln limousine
ridin' in the back seat next to my wife
headed straight on in to the afterlife
i'm leaning to the left, i got my head in her lap
oh lord, i've been led into some kind of a trap
where we ask no quarter, and no quarter do we give
we're right down the street, from the street where you live
they mutilated his body and they took out his brain
what more could they do? they piled on the pain
but his soul was not there where it was supposed to be at
for the last fifty years they've been searchin' for that
freedom, oh freedom, freedom over me
i hate to tell you, mister, but only dead men are free
send me some lovin', then tell me no lie
throw the gun in the gutter and walk on by
wake up, little susie, let's go for a drive
cross the trinity river, let's keep hope alive
turn the radio on, don't touch the dials
parkland hospital, only six more miles
you got me dizzy, miss lizzy, you filled me with lead
that magic bullet of yours has gone to my head
i'm just a patsy like patsy cline
never shot anyone from in front or behind
i've blood in my eye, got blood in my ear
i'm never gonna make it to the new frontier
zapruder's film, i've seen that before
seen it thirty-three times, maybe more
it's vile and deceitful, it's cruel and it's mean
ugliest thing that you ever have seen
they killed him once and they killed him twice
killed him like a human sacrifice
the day that they killed him, someone said to me, "son
the age of the antichrist has just only begun"
air force one comin' in through the gate
johnson sworn in at 2:38
let me know when you decide to throw in the towel
it is what it is, and it's murder most foul


what's new, pussycat? what'd i say?
i said the soul of a nation been torn away
and it's beginning to go into a slow decay
and that it's thirty-six hours past judgment day

tell them, "we're waiting, keep coming," we'll get them as well
