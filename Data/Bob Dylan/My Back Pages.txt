crimson flames tied through my ears
rolling high and mighty traps
pounced with fire on flaming roads
using ideas as my maps
"we'll meet on edges, soon," said i
proud 'neath heated brow


half-wracked prejudice leaped forth
"rip down all hate," i screamed
lies that life is black and white
spoke from my skull, i dreamed
romantic facts of musketeers
foundationed deep, somehow


girls' faces formed the forward path
from phony jealousy
to memorizing politics
of ancient history
flung down by corpse evangelists
unthought of, though, somehow


a self-ordained professor's tongue
too serious to fool
spouted out that liberty
is just equality in school
"equality," i spoke the word
as if a wedding vow


in a soldier's stance, i aimed my hand
at the mongrel dogs who teach
fearing not i'd become my enemy
in the instant that i preach
my existence led by confusion boats
mutiny from stern to bow


yes, my guard stood hard when abstract threats
too noble to neglect
deceived me into thinking
i had something to protect
good and bad, i define these terms
quite clear, no doubt, somehow
