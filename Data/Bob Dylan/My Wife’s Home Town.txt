well i didn't come here to deal with a dog gone thing
i just came here to hear the drummer's cymbal ring
there is no way you can put me down
i just want to say that hell's my wife's home town


well there's reasons for that and reasons for this
i can't think of any just now, but i know they exist
i'm sitting in the sun till my skin turns brown
i just want to say that hell's my wife's home town
home town, home town


she can make you steal, make you rob
give you the hives, make you lose your job
make things bad, she can make things worse
she got stuff more potent than a gypsy curse


one of these days, i'll end up on the run
i'm pretty sure, she'll make me kill someone
i'm going inside, roll the shutters down
i just want to say that hell's my wife's home town


well there's plenty to remember, plenty to forget
i still can remember the day we met
i lost my reason long ago
my love for her is all i know


state gone broke, the county's dry
don't be looking at me, with that evil eye
keep on walking don't be hanging around
i'm telling you again that hell's my wife's home town
home town, home town
