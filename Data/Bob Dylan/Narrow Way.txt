i'm gonna walk across the desert 'til i'm in my right mind
i won't even think about what i left behind
nothing back there anyway that i can call my own
go back home, leave me alone


it's a long road
it's a long and narrow way
if i can't work up to you
you'll surely have to work down to me someday


ever since the british burned the white house down
there's a bleeding wound in the heart of town
i saw you drinking from an empty cup
i saw you buried and i saw you dug up


it's a long road
it's a long and narrow way
if i can't work up to you
you'll surely have to work down to me someday


look down, angel from the skies
help my weary soul to rise
i kissed her cheek, i dragged your plow
you broke my heart, i was your friend 'til now


it's a long road
it's a long and narrow way
if i can't work up to you
you'll surely have to work down to me someday


in the courtyard of the golden sun
you stand and fight or you break and run
you went and lost your lovely head
for a drink of wine and a crust of bread


it's a long road
it's a long and narrow way
if i can't work up to you
you'll surely have to work down to me someday


we looted and we plundered on distant shores
why is my share not equal to yours?
your father left you, your mother too
even death has washed its hands of you


it's a long road
it's a long and narrow way
if i can't work up to you
you'll surely have to work down to me someday


this is hard country to stay alive in
blades are everywhere and they're breaking my skin
i'm armed to the hilt and i'm struggling hard
you won't get out of here unscarred


it's a long road
it's a long and narrow way
if i can't work up to you
you'll surely have to work down to me someday


you got too many lovers waiting at the wall
if i had a thousand tongues, i couldn't count them all
yesterday i could've thrown them all in the sea
today even one may be too much for me


it's a long road
it's a long and narrow way
if i can't work up to you
you'll surely have to work down to me someday


keep walking baby, you could do no wrong
put your arms around me, where they belong
i won't take you on a roller-coaster ride
lay my hands all over you, tie you to my side


it's a long road
it's a long and narrow way
if i can't work up to you
you'll surely have to work down to me someday


i've got a heavy stacked woman with a smile on her face
and she has crowned my soul with grace
i'm still hurting from an arrow that pierced my chest
i'm gonna have to take my head and bury it between your breasts


it's a long road
it's a long and narrow way
if i can't work up to you
you'll surely have to work down to me someday


been dark all night but now it's dawn
the moving finger is moving on
you can guard me while i sleep
kiss away the tears i weep


it's a long road
it's a long and narrow way
if i can't work up to you
you'll surely have to work down to me someday


i love women and she loves men
we've been to the west and we going back again
i heard a voice at the dusk of day
saying, "be gentle brother, be gentle and pray."


it's a long road
it's a long and narrow way
if i can't work up to you
you'll surely have to work down to me someday
