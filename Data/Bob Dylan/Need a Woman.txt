lately i've been having evil dreams
i wake up in a cold blue glare
i run the tape back in my mind
wonder if i took the wrong road somewhere
searching for the truth the way god designed it
well the real truth is that i might be afraid to find it


well, i need a woman, alright
need a woman, every night
to be with me and know me as i am
show me the kind of love that don't have to be condemned
and i want you to be that woman every day
be that woman every way


well i've had my eyes on you baby for five long years
well you probably don't know me at all
but i've seen your laughter and i've seen your tears
a tell-tale heart will show itself to anybody near
there's always some new stranger in the night
to lend a sympathetic ear


well i need a woman to be my own
i need a woman that's mine alone
seen you in the doorway, i seen you in the park
seen you in the sunshine, i seen you in the dark
and i want you to be that woman oh oh oh
be that woman every way


you keep listening to something long enough
you just bound to believe that it's true
you know there's some things that you put out
it's gonna come back on you
that which is not permanent don't last
whatever's waiting in the future
could be what you're running from in the past


well i need a woman, oh pull up
need a woman, drinking from the same cup
someone who likes simple things, is not afraid to bend
someone who don't make herself up to make every man her friend
and i want you to be that woman every day
be that woman every way


don't know what you got that i want
don't know what i got to give
don't know how much time i've got
don't know how long i'll live
the rebellion in my soul, why was it created?
to blur the focus of my mind and keep me isolated


but i need a woman, she ain't no crime
need a woman, all the time
to see the promised land with me as the time goes by
to rule my heart with sweetness and boldness from on high
and i want you to be that woman, yes i do
be that woman straight and true
