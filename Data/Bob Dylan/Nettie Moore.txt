lost john sitting on a railroad track
something's out of whack
blues this morning falling down like hail
gonna leave a greasy trail


gonna travel the world is what i'm gonna do
then come back and see you
all i ever do is struggle and strive
if i don't do anybody any harm, i might make it back home alive


i'm the oldest son of a crazy man
i'm in a cowboy band
got a pile of sins to pay for and i ain't got time to hide
i'd walk through a blazing fire, baby, if i knew you was on the other side


oh, i miss you nettie moore
and my happiness is o'er
winter's gone, the river's on the rise
i loved you then and ever shall
but there's no one here left to tell
the world has gone black before my eyes


the world of research has gone berserk
too much paperwork
albert's in the graveyard, frankie's raising hell
i'm beginning to believe what the scriptures tell


i'm going where the southern crosses the yellow dog
get away from these demagogues
and these bad luck women stick like glue
it's either one or the other or neither of the two


she says, "look out daddy, don't want you to tear your pants
you can get wrecked in this dance."
they say whiskey will kill ya, but i don't think it will
i'm riding with you to the top of the hill


oh, i miss you nettie moore
and my happiness is o'er
winter's gone, the river's on the rise
i loved you then and ever shall
but there's no one here left to tell
the world has gone black before my eyes


don't know why my baby never looked so good before
i don't have to wonder no more
she been cooking all day and it's gonna take me all night
i can't eat all that stuff in a single bite


the judge is coming in, everybody rise
lift up your eyes
you can do what you please, you don't need my advice
before you call me any dirty names you better think twice


getting light outside, the temperature dropped
i think the rain has stopped
i'm going to make you come to grips with fate
when i'm through with you, you'll learn to keep your business straight


oh, i miss you nettie moore
and my happiness is o'er
winter's gone, the river's on the rise
i loved you then and ever shall
but there's no one here left to tell
the world has gone black before my eyes


the bright spark of the steady lights
has dimmed my sights
when you're around all my grief gives 'way
a lifetime with you is like some heavenly day


everything i've ever known to be right has been proven wrong
i'll be drifting along
the woman i'm a-loving, she rules my heart
no knife could ever cut our love apart


today i'll stand in faith and raise
the voice of praise
the sun is strong, i'm standing in the light
i wish to god that it were night


oh, i miss you nettie moore
and my happiness is o'er
winter's gone, the river's on the rise
i loved you then and ever shall
but there's no one here left to tell
the world has gone black before my eyes
