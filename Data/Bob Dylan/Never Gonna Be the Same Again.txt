now you’re here beside me, baby
you’re a living dream
and every time you get this close
it makes me want to scream
you touched me and you knew
that i was warm for you and then
i am never going to be the same again


sorry if i hurt you, baby
sorry if i did
sorry if i touched the place
where your secrets are hid
but you meant more than everything
and i could not pretend
i am never going to be the same again


you give me something to think about, baby
every time i see you
don’t worry, baby, i don’t mind leaving
i’d just like it to be my idea


you taught me how to love you, baby
you taught me, oh, so well
now, i can’t go back to what was, baby
i can’t unring the bell
you took my reality
and cast it to the wind
and i am not going to be the same again
