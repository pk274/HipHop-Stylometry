twilight on the frozen lake
north wind about to break
on footprints in the snow
silence down below


you’re beautiful beyond words
you’re beautiful to me
you can make me cry
never say goodbye


time is all i have to give
you can have it if you choose
with me you can live
never say goodbye


my dreams are made of iron and steel
with a big bouquet
of roses hanging down
from the heavens to the ground


the crashing waves roll over me
as i stand upon the sand
wait for you to come
and grab hold of my hand


oh, baby, baby, baby blue
you’ll change your last name, too
you’ve turned your hair to brown
love to see it hanging’ down
