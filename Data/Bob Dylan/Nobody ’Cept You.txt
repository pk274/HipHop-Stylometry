there’s nothing ’round here i believe in
’cept you, yeah you
and there’s nothing to me that’s sacred
’cept you, yeah you


you’re the one that reaches me
you’re the one that i admire
every time we meet together
my soul feels like it’s on fire
nothing matters to me
and there’s nothing i desire
’cept you, yeah you


nothing ’round here i care to try for
’cept you, yeah you
got nothing left to live or die for
’cept you, yeah you


there’s a hymn i used to hear
in the churches all the time
make me feel so good inside
so peaceful, so sublime
and there’s nothing to remind me of that
old familiar chime
’cept you, uh huh you


used to play in the cemetery
dance and sing and run when i was a child
never seemed strange
but now i just pass mournfully by
that place where the bones of life are piled
i know something’ has changed
i’m a stranger here and no one sees me
’cept you, yeah you


nothing much matters or seems to please me
’cept you, yeah you
nothing hypnotizes me
or holds me in a spell
everything runs by me
just like water from a well
everybody wants my attention
everybody’s got something to sell
’cept you, yeah you
