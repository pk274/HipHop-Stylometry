shadows are fallin' and i've been here all day
it's too hot to sleep and time is runnin' away
feel like my soul has turned into steel
i've still got the scars that the sun didn't heal


there's not even room enough to be anywhere
it's not dark yet, but it's gettin' there


well, my sense of humanity has gone down the drain
behind every beautiful thing there's been some kind of pain
she wrote me a letter and she wrote it so kind
she put down in writin' what was in her mind


i just don't see why i should even care
it's not dark yet, but it's gettin' there


well, i've been to london and i've been to gay paris
i've followed the river and i got to the sea
i've been down on the bottom of a world full of lies
i ain't lookin' for nothin' in anyone’s eyes


sometimes my burden is more than i can bear
it's not dark yet, but it's gettin' there


i was born here and i'll die here against my will
i know it looks like i'm movin', but i'm standin' still
every nerve in my body is so vacant and numb
i can’t even remember what it was i came here to get away from
