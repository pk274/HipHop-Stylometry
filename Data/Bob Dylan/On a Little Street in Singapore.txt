on a little street in singapore
we'd meet beside a lotus-covered door
a veil of moonlight on her lonely face
how pale the hands that held me in embrace


my sails tonight are filled with perfume of shalimar
and temple bells will guide me to the shore
and then i'll hold her in my arms and love the way i loved before
on a little street in singapore
