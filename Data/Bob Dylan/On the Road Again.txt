well, i wake up in the morning, there's frogs inside my socks
your mama, she's hidin' inside the icebox
your daddy walks in wearin' a napoleon bonaparte mask
then you ask why i don't live here
honey, do you have to ask?


well, i go to pet your monkey, i get a face full of claws
i ask who's in the fireplace and you tell me santa claus
the milkman comes in, he's wearing a derby hat
and you ask why i don't live here
honey, how come you have to ask me that?


well, i asked for somethin' to eat, i'm hungry as a hog
so i get brown rice, seaweed and a dirty hot dog
i've got a hole where my stomach disappeared
then you ask why i don't live here
honey, i gotta' think you're really weird


your grandpa's cane, it turns into a sword
your grandma prays to pictures that are pasted on a board
everything inside my pockets your uncle steals
and you ask why i don't live here
honey, i can't believe that you're for real


there's fistfights in the kitchen, they're enough to make me cry
little mailman comes in, even he's got to take a side
even the butler, he's got something to prove
then you ask why i don't live here
honey, how come you don't move?
