one more night, the stars are in sight
but tonight i'm as lonesome as can be
oh, the moon is shinin' bright
lighting everything in sight
but tonight no light will shine on me


oh, it's shameful and it's sad i lost the only pal i had
i just could not be what she wanted me to be
i will turn my head up high
to that dark and rollin' sky
for tonight no light will shine on me


i was so mistaken when i thought that she'd be true
i had no idea what a woman in love would do


one more night, i will wait for the light
while the wind blows high above the tree
oh, i miss my darlin' so
i didn't mean to see her go
but tonight no light will shine on me


one more night, the moon is shinin' bright
and the wind blows high above the tree
oh, i miss that woman so
i didn't mean to see her go
but tonight no light will shine on me
