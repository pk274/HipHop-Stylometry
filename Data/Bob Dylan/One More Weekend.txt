slipping and sliding like a weasel on the run
i’m looking good to see you, yeah, and we can have some fun
one more weekend, one more weekend with you
one more weekend, one more weekend’ll do


come on down to my ship, honey, ride on deck
we’ll fly over the ocean just like you suspect
one more weekend, one more weekend with you
one more weekend, one more weekend’ll do


we’ll fly the night away
hang out the whole next day
things will be okay
you wait and see
we’ll go someplace unknown
leave all the children home
honey, why not go alone
just you and me


coming and going like a rabbit in the wood
i’m happy just to see you, yeah, looking so good
one more weekend, one more weekend with you
one more weekend, one more weekend’ll do (yes, you will!)


like a needle in a haystack, i’m gonna find you yet
you’re the sweetest gone mama that this boy’s ever gonna get
one more weekend, one more weekend with you
one more weekend, one more weekend’ll do
