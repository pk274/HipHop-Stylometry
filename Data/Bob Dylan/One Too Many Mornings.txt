down the street, the dogs are barkin' and the day is a-gettin' dark
as the night comes in a-falling, the dogs will lose their bark
and the silent night will shatter from the sounds inside my mind


from the crossroads of my doorstep, my eyes start to fade
and i turn my head back to the room where my love and i have laid
and i gaze back to the street, the sidewalk, and the sign


it's a restless hungry feeling that don't mean no one no good
when everything i'm a-sayin', you can say it just as good
you're right from your side, i am right from mine
