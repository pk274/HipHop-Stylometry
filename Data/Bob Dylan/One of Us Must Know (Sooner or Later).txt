i didn't mean to treat you so bad
you shouldn't take it so personal
i didn't mean to make you so sad
you just happened to be there, that's all
when i saw you say goodbye to your friend and smile
i thought that it was well understood
that you'd be comin' back in a little while
i didn't know that you were sayin' goodbye for good


but, sooner or later, one of us must know
that you just did what you're supposed to do
sooner or later, one of us must know
that i really did try to get close to you


i couldn't see what you could show me
your scarf had kept your mouth well hid
i couldn't see how you could know me
but you said you knew me and i believed you did
when you whispered in my ear
and asked me if i was leavin' with you or her
i didn't realize just what i did hear
i didn't realize how young you were


but, sooner or later, one of us must know
that you just did what you're supposed to do
sooner or later, one of us must know
that i really did try to get close to you


and i couldn't see when it started snowin'
your voice was all that i heard
i couldn't see where we were goin'
but you said you knew and i took your word
and then you told me later, as i apologized
that you were just kiddin' me, you weren't really from the farm
and i told you, as you clawed out my eyes
that i never really meant to do you any harm


but, sooner or later, one of us must know
that you just did what you're supposed to do
sooner or later, one of us must know
that i really did try to get close to you
