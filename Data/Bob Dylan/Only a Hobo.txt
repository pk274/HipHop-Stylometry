as i was out walking on a corner one day
i spied an old hobo, in a doorway he lay
his face was all grounded in the cold sidewalk floor
and i guess he’d been there for the whole night or more


only a hobo, but one more is gone
leaving nobody to sing his sad song
leaving nobody to carry him home
only a hobo, but one more is gone


a blanket of newspaper covered his head
as the curb was his pillow, the street was his bed
one look at his face showed the hard road he’d come
and a fistful of coins showed the money he bummed




does it take much of a man to see his whole life go down
to look up on the world from a hole in the ground
to wait for your future like a horse that’s gone lame
to lie in the gutter and die with no name?
