oxford town, oxford town
everybody's got their heads bowed down
sun don't shine above the ground
ain't a-going down to oxford town


he went down to oxford town
guns and clubs followed him down
all because his face was brown
better get away from oxford town


oxford town around the bend
come to the door, he couldn't get in
all because of the color of his skin
what do you think about that, my friend?


me, my girl, my girl's son
we got met with a tear gas bomb
i don't even know why we come
going back where we come from


oxford town in the afternoon
everybody singing a sorrowful tune
two men died 'neath the mississippi moon
somebody better investigate soon
