o' little town of bethlehem, how still we see thee lie
above thy deep and dreamless sleep, the silent stars go by
yet in thy dark streets shine an everlasting light
the hopes and fears of all the years are met in thee tonight


how silently, how silently the wondrous gift is given
so god imparts to human hearts the blessings of all his heaven
no ear may hear his coming, but in this world of sin
where meek souls will receive him still, the dear christ enters in


amen
