trails of troubles
roads of battles
paths of victory
i shall walk


the trail is dusty
and my road it might be rough
but the better roads are waiting
and boys it ain’t far off




i walked down by the river
i turned my head up high
i saw that silver linin’
that was hanging in the sky




the evening dusk was rolling
i was walking down the track
there was a one-way wind a-blowin’
and it was blowin’ at my back




the gravel road is bumpy
it’s a hard road to ride
but there’s a clearer road a-waitin’
with the cinders on the side




that evening train was rolling
the humming of its wheels
my eyes they saw a better day
as i looked across the fields




the trail is dusty
the road it might be rough
but the good road is a-waiting
and boys it ain’t far off
