we live in a political world
love don’t have any place
we’re living in times where men commit crimes
and crime don’t have a face


we live in a political world
icicles hanging down
wedding bells ring and angels sing
clouds cover up the ground


we live in a political world
wisdom is thrown into jail
it rots in a cell, is misguided as hell
leaving no one to pick up a trail


we live in a political world
where mercy walks the plank
life is in mirrors, death disappears
up the steps into the nearest bank


we live in a political world
where courage is a thing of the past
houses are haunted, children are unwanted
the next day could be your last


we live in a political world
the one we can see and can feel
but there’s no one to check, it’s all a stacked deck
we all know for sure that it’s real


we live in a political world
in the cities of lonesome fear
little by little you turn in the middle
but you’re never sure why you’re here


we live in a political world
under the microscope
you can travel anywhere and hang yourself there
you always got more than enough rope


we live in a political world
turning and a-thrashing about
as soon as you’re awake, you’re trained to take
what looks like the easy way out


we live in a political world
where peace is not welcome at all
it’s turned away from the door to wander some more
or put up against the wall


we live in a political world
everything is hers or his
climb into the frame and shout god’s name
but you’re never sure what it is
