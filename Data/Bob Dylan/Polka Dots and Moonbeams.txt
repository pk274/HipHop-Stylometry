a country dance was being held in a garden
i felt a bump and heard an, "oh, beg your pardon"
suddenly i saw polka dots and moonbeams
all around a pug-nosed dream


the music started and was i the perplexed one?
i held my breath and said, "may i have the next one?"
in my frightened arms, polka dots and moonbeams
sparkled on a pug-nosed dream


there were questions in the eyes of other dancers
as we floated over the floor
there were questions but my heart knew all the answers
and perhaps a few things more


now in a cottage built of lilacs and laughter
i know the meaning of the words, "ever after"
and i'll always see polka dots and moonbeams
when i kiss the pug-nosed dream
