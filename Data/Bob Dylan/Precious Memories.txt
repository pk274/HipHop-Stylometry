as i travel down life's pathway
know not what the years may hold
as i ponder, hopes grow fonder
precious memories flood my soul


precious memories, how they linger
how they ever flood my soul
in the stillness of the midnight
precious sacred scenes unfold


precious father, loving mother
glide across the lonely years
and old homes scenes of my childhood
in fond memory appears


precious memories, how they linger
how they ever flood my soul
in the stillness of the midnight
precious sacred scenes unfold
