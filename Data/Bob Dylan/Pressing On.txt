well i’m pressing on
yes, i’m pressing on
well i’m pressing on
to the higher calling of my lord


many try to stop me, shake me up in my mind
say, “prove to me that he is lord, show me a sign”
what kind of sign they need when it all come from within
when what’s lost has been found, what’s to come has already been?


well i’m pressing on
yes, i’m pressing on
well i’m pressing on
to the higher calling of my lord


shake the dust off of your feet, don’t look back
nothing now can hold you down, nothing that you lack
temptation’s not an easy thing, adam given the devil reign
because he sinned i got no choice, it run in my vein


well i’m pressing on
yes, i’m pressing on
well i’m pressing on
to the higher calling of my lord
