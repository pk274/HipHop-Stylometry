i've been around this whole country
but i never yet found fenneario


well, as we marched down, as we marched down
well, as we marched down to fennerio
well, our captain fell in love with a lady like a dove
her name that she had was pretty peggy-o


well, what will your mother say, what will your mother say
what will your mother say, pretty peggy-o
what will your mother say to know you're going away
you're never, never, never coming back-io ?


come a-running down your stairs
come a-running down your stairs
come a-running down your stairs, pretty peggy-o
come a-running down your stairs
combing back your yellow hair
you're the prettiest darned girl i ever seen-io


the lieutenant he has gone
the lieutenant he has gone
the lieutenant he has gone, pretty peggy-o
the lieutenant he has gone, long gone
he's a-riding down in texas with the rodeo


well, our captain he is dead, our captain he is dead
our captain he is dead, pretty peggy-o
well, our captain he is dead, died for a maid
he's buried somewhere in louisiana-o
