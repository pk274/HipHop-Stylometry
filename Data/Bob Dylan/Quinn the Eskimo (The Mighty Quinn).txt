everybody’s building the big ships and the boats
some are building monuments
others, jotting down notes
ev’rybody’s in despair
every girl and boy
but when quinn the eskimo gets here
ev’rybody’s gonna jump for joy
come all without, come all within
you’ll not see nothing like the mighty quinn


i like to do just like the rest, i like my sugar sweet
but guarding fumes and making haste
it ain’t my cup of meat
everybody’s neath the trees
feeding pigeons on a limb
but when quinn the eskimo gets here
all the pigeons gonna run to him
come all without, come all within
you’ll not see nothing like the mighty quinn


a cat’s meow and a cow’s moo, i can recite them all
just tell me where it hurts yuh, honey
and i’ll tell you who to call
nobody can get no sleep
there’s someone on ev’ryone’s toes
but when quinn the eskimo gets here
ev’rybody’s gonna wanna doze
come all without, come all within
you’ll not see nothing like the mighty quinn
