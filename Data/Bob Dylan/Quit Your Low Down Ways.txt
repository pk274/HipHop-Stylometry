oh, you can read out your bible
you can fall down on your knees, pretty mama
and pray to the lord
but it ain’t gonna do no good


you’re gonna need
you’re gonna need my help someday
well, if you can’t quit your sinning
please quit your low down ways


well, you can run down to the white house
you can gaze at the capitol dome, pretty mama
you can pound on the president’s gate
but you oughta know by now it’s gonna be too late




well, you can run down to the desert
throw yourself on the burning sand
you can raise up your right hand, pretty mama
but you better understand you done lost your one good man




and you can hitchhike on the highway
you can stand all alone by the side of the road
you can try to flag a ride back home, pretty mama
but you can’t ride in my car no more
