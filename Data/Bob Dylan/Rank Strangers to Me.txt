i wandered again to my home in the mountain
where in youth's early days i was happy and free
i looked for my friends but i never could find them
i found they were all rank strangers to me


everybody i met seemed to be a rank stranger
no mother or dad not a friend could i see
they knew not my name and i knew not their faces
i found they were all rank strangers to me


they all moved away, said a voice of a stranger
"to that beautiful home by the bright crystal sea"
some beautiful day i'll meet them in heaven
where no one will be a stranger to me
