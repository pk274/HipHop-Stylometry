go ahead, drive the nails through my hand
laugh at me where you stand
go ahead, say it isn't me
but the day will come
that you will see


'cause i'll rise again
ain't no power on earth can tie me down
yes, i'll rise again
death can't keep me buried in the ground


go ahead and mock my name
you will see, i'm still the same
go ahead, try to bury me
very, very soon
i will be free


'cause i'll rise again
ain't no power on earth can tie me now
and i'll rise again
death can't keep me buried in the ground


go ahead, say i'm dead and gone
you will see that you were wrong
go ahead, try to hide the son
but the day will come
when you'll see i'm the one


'cause i'll rise again
ain't no power on earth can tie me down
yes, i'll rise again
death can't keep me buried in the ground
