doctor, doctor tell me the time of day
another bottle's empty, another penny spent
he turned around and he slowly walked away
they shot him in the back and down he went


shine your light
movin' on
you burned so bright
roll on, john


from the liverpool docks to the red-light hamburg streets
down in the quarry with the quarrymen
playing to the big crowds, playing to the cheap seats
another day in the life on your way to your journey's end


shine your light
movin' on
you burned so bright
roll on, john


sailin' through the trade winds bound for the south
rags on your back just like any other slave
they tied your hands and they clamped your mouth
wasn't no way out of that deep dark cave


shine your light
movin' on
you burned so bright
roll on, john


i heard the news today, oh boy
they hauled your ship up on the shore
now the city gone dark, there is no more joy
they tore the heart right out and cut him to the core


shine your light
movin' on
you burned so bright
roll on, john


put on your bags and get 'em packed
leave right now, you won't be far from wrong
the sooner you go the quicker you'll be back
you've been cooped up on an island far too long


shine your light
movin' on
you burned so bright
roll on, john


slow down you're moving way too fast
come together right now over me
your bones are weary, you're about to breathe your last
lord, you know how hard that it can be


shine your light
movin' on
you burned so bright
roll on, john


roll on, john, roll through the rain and snow
take the right-hand road and go where the buffalo roam
they'll trap you in an ambush before you know
too late now to sail back home


shine your light
movin' on
you burned so bright
roll on, john


tyger, tyger burning bright
i pray the lord my soul to keep
in the forests of the night
cover 'em over and let him sleep


shine your light
movin' on
you burned so bright
roll on, john
