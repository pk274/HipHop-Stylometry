i rolled and i tumbled, i cried the whole night long
i rolled and i tumbled, i cried the whole night long
woke up this morning', i must have bet my money wrong


i got troubles so hard, i can't stand the strain
i got troubles so hard, i just can't stand the strain
some young lazy slut has charmed away my brains


the landscape is glowing', gleaming' in the golden light of day
the landscape is glowing', gleaming' in the gold light of day
i am not holding nothing' back now, i am not standing' in anybody's way


well, i did all i know just to keep you off my mind
well, i did all i know just to keep you off my mind
well, i paid and i paid and my suffering' heart is always on the line


well, i get up in the dawn and i go down and lay in the shade
i get up in the dawn and i go down and lay in the shade
i ain't nobody's house boy, i ain't nobody's well trained maid


i'm flat-out spent, this woman has been driving' me to tears
i'm flat-out spent, this woman she has been driving' me to tears
this woman so crazy, i swear i ain't gonna touch another one for years


well, the warm weather is coming' and the buds are on the vine
the warm weather's comin', the buds are on the vine
ain't nothing so depressing as trying to satisfy this woman of mine


i got up this morning', saw the rising sun return
well, i got up this morning', seen the rising sun return
sooner or later you too shall burn


the night's filled with shadows, the years are filled with early doom
the night's filled with shadows, the years are filled with early doom
i've been conjuring up all these long dead souls from their crumbling' tombs


let's forgive each other darling', let's go down to the greenwood glen
let's forgive each other darling', let's go down to the greenwood glen
let's put our heads together, let's put old matters to an end


now i rolled and i tumbled and i cried the whole night long
ah, i rolled and i tumbled, i cried the whole night long
i woke up this morning, i think i must be traveling' wrong
