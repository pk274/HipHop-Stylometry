look who's back in town
ain't nobody but sally sue brown
all you boys better run for cover
if you don't a-wanna be a broken hearted lover


see her in that very tight skirt
got what it takes
just to make you hurt
don't be deceived by those big bright eyes
prefer to treat her nasty and low down lies


makes no difference where she's been
i'm go in south and doing them things again
bake in a hot tub, down the line
i'd rather see you ruin this a-heart of mine


i'll go see them come down my way
like a fool you're gonna hear me say
"i'll lay at your bed sally sue brown
please let me love you, baby
don't put me down"
