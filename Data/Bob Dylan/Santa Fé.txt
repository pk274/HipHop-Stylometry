santa fe, dear, dear, dear, dear, dear santa fe
my woman needs it everyday
she promised this a-lad she’d stay
she’s rolling up a lotta bread to toss away


she’s in santa fe, dear, dear, dear, dear, dear santa fe
now she’s opened up an old maid’s home
she’s proud, but she needs to roam
she’s gonna write herself a roadside poem about santa fe


santa fe, dear, dear, dear, dear, dear santa fe
since i’m never gonna cease to roam
i’m never, ever far from home
but i’ll build a geodesic dome and sail away


don’t feel bad, no, no, no, no, don’t feel bad
it’s the best food i’ve ever had
makes me feel so glad
that she’s cooking in a homemade pad
she never caught a cold so bad when i’m away


santa fe, dear, dear, dear, dear, dear, dear santa fe
my shrimp boat’s in the bay
i won’t have my nature this way
and i’m leaning on the wheel each day to drift away from


santa fe, dear, dear, dear, dear, dear santa fe
my sister looks good at home
she’s licking on an ice cream cone
she’s packin’ her big white comb
what does it weigh?
