i was blinded by the devil
born already ruined
stone-cold dead
as i stepped out of the womb
by his grace i have been touched
by his word i have been healed
by his hand i’ve been delivered
by his spirit i’ve been sealed


i’ve been saved
by the blood of the lamb
saved
by the blood of the lamb
saved
saved
and i’m so glad
yes, i’m so glad
i’m so glad
so glad
i want to thank you, lord
i just want to thank you, lord
thank you, lord


by his truth i can be upright
by his strength i do endure
by his power i’ve been lifted
in his love i am secure
he bought me with a price
freed me from the pit
full of emptiness and wrath
and the fire that burns in it


i’ve been saved
by the blood of the lamb
saved
by the blood of the lamb
saved
saved
and i’m so glad
yes, i’m so glad
i’m so glad
so glad
i want to thank you, lord
i just want to thank you, lord
thank you, lord


nobody to rescue me
nobody would dare
i was going down for the last time
but by his mercy i’ve been spared
not by works
but by faith in him who called
for so long i’ve been hindered
for so long i’ve been stalled


i’ve been saved
by the blood of the lamb
saved
by the blood of the lamb
saved
saved
and i’m so glad
yes, i’m so glad
i’m so glad
so glad
i want to thank you, lord
i just want to thank you, lord
thank you, lord
