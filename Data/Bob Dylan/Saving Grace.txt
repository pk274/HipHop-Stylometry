if you find it in your heart, can i be forgiven?
guess i owe you some kind of apology
i’ve escaped death so many times, i know i’m only living
by the saving grace that’s over me


by this time i’d-a thought i would be sleeping
in a pine box for all eternity
my faith keeps me alive, but i still be weeping
for the saving grace that’s over me


well, the death of life, then come the resurrection
wherever i am welcome is where i’ll be
i put all my confidence in him, my sole protection
is the saving grace that’s over me


well, the devil’s shining light, it can be most blinding
but to search for love, that ain’t no more than vanity
as i look around this world all that i’m finding
is the saving grace that’s over me


the wicked know no peace and you just can’t fake it
there’s only one road and it leads to calvary
it gets discouraging at times, but i know i’ll make it
by the saving grace that’s over me
