in scarlet town, where i was born
there’s ivy leaf and silver thorn
the streets have names that you can’t pronounce
gold is down to a quarter of an ounce
the music starts and the people sway
everybody says, “are you going my way?"
uncle tom still working' for uncle bill
scarlet town is under the hill


scarlet town in the month of may
sweet william on his deathbed lay
mistress mary by the side of the bed
kissing' his face and heaping prayers on his head
so brave and true, so gentle is he
i’ll weep for him as he would weep for me
little boy blue come blow your horn
in scarlet town, where i was born


scarlet town, in the hot noon hours
there’s palm-leaf shadows and scattered flowers
beggars crouching at the gate
help comes, but it comes too late
by marble slabs and in fields of stone
you make your humble wishes known
i touched the garment, but the hem was torn
in scarlet town, where i was born


in scarlet town, the end is near
the seven wonders of the world are here
the evil and the good living' side by side
all human forms seem glorified
put your heart on a platter and see who will bite
see who will hold you and kiss you good night
there’s walnut groves and maplewood
in scarlet town crying' won’t do no good


in scarlet town, you fight your father’s foes
up on the hill, a chilly wind blows
you fight ‘em on high and you fight 'em down in
you fight 'em with whiskey, morphine and gin
you’ve got legs that can drive men mad
a lot of things we didn’t do that i wish we had
in scarlet town, the sky is clear
you’ll wish to god that you stayed right here


set ‘em joe, play “walking the floor"
play it for my flat-chested junkie whore
i’m staying up late, i’m making amends
while we smile, all heaven descends
if love is a sin, then beauty is a crime
all things are beautiful in their time
the black and the white, the yellow and the brown
it’s all right there in front of you in scarlet town
