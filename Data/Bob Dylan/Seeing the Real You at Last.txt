well, i thought that the rain would cool things down
but it looks like it don’t
i’d like to get you to change your mind
but it looks like you won’t


from now on i’ll be busy
i am not going to nowhere fast
i’m just glad it’s over
and i’m seeing the real you at last


well, didn’t i risk my neck for you
didn’t i take chances?
didn’t i rise above it all for you
the most unfortunate circumstances?


well, i have had some rotten nights
didn’t think that they would pass
i’m just thankful and grateful
to be seeing the real you at last


i’m hungry and i’m irritable
and i’m tired of this bag of tricks
at one time there was nothing wrong with me
that you could not fix


well, i sailed through the storm
strapped to the mast
but the time has come
and i’m seeing the real you at last


when i met you, baby
you didn’t show no visible scars
you could ride like annie oakley
you could shoot like belle starr


well, i don’t mind a reasonable amount of trouble
trouble always comes to pass
but all i care about now
is that i’m seeing the real you at last


well, i’m going to quit this baby talk now
i guess i should have known
i got troubles, i think maybe you got troubles
i think maybe we’d better leave each other alone


whatever you going to do
please do it fast
i’m still trying to get used to
seeing the real you at last
