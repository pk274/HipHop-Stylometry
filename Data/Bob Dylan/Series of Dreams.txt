i was thinking of a series of dreams
where nothing comes up to the top
everything stays down where it's wounded
and comes to a permanent stop
wasn't thinking of anything specific
like in a dream when someone wakes up and screams
nothing too very scientific
just thinking of a series of dreams


thinking of a series of dreams
where the time and the tempo fly
and there's no exit in any direction
'cept the one that you can't see with your eyes
wasn't making any great connection
wasn't falling for any intricate scheme
nothing that would pass inspection
i was just thinking of a series of dreams


dreams where the umbrella is folded
down into the path you are hurled
and the cards are no good that you're holding
unless they're from another world


in one, the surface was frozen
in another, i witnessed a crime
in one, i was running, and in another
all i seemed to be doing was climbing
wasn't looking for any special assistance
and not going to any great extremes
i'd already gone the distance
just thinking of a series of dreams


dreams where the umbrella is folded
down into the path you are hurled
and the cards are no good that you're holding
unless they're from another world


i'd already gone the distance
i was just thinking of a series of dreams
just thinking of a series of dreams
just thinking of a series of dreams
