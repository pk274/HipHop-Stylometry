seven days, seven more days she’ll be coming
i’ll be waiting at the station for her to arrive
seven more days, all i gotta do is survive


she been gone ever since i been a child
ever since i seen her smile, i ain’t forgotten her eyes
she had a face that could outshine the sun in the skies

i been good, i been good while i been waiting
maybe guilty of hesitating, i just been holding on
seven more days, all that’ll be gone


there’s kissing in the valley
thieving in the alley
fighting every inch of the way
trying to be tender
with somebody i remember
in a night that’s always brighter’n the day


seven days, seven more days that are connected
just like i expected, she’ll be coming on forth
my beautiful comrade from the north
