oh, shenandoah, i long to hear you
look away, you rolling river
oh, shenandoah, i long to hear you
look away. we're bound away
across the wide missouri


now the missouri is a mighty river
look away, you rolling river
indians camp along her border
look away. we're bound away
across the wide missouri


well a white man loved an indian maiden
look away, you rolling river
with notions his canoe was laden
look away, we're bound away
across the wide missouri


oh shenandoah, i love your daughter
look away, you rolling river
it was for her i'd cross the water
look away, we're bound away
across the wide missouri


for seven long years i courted sally
look away, you rolling river
seven more years i longed to have her
look away, we're bound away
across the wide missouri


well, it's fare-thee-well, my dear
i'm bound to leave you
look away you rolling river
shenandoah, i will not deceive you
look away, we're bound away
across the wide missouri
