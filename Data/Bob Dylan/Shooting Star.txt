seen a shooting star tonight
and i thought of you
you were trying to break into another world
a world i never knew
i always kind of wondered
if you ever made it through
seen a shooting star tonight
and i thought of you


seen a shooting star tonight
and i thought of me
if i was still the same
if i ever became what you wanted me to be
did i miss the mark or overstep the line
that only you could see?
seen a shooting star tonight
and i thought of me


listen to the engine, listen to the bell
as the last fire truck from hell
goes rolling by
all good people are praying
it’s the last temptation, the last account
the last time you might hear the sermon on the mount
the last radio is playing


seen a shooting star tonight
slip away
tomorrow will be
another day
guess it’s too late to say the things to you
that you needed to hear me say
seen a shooting star tonight
slip away
