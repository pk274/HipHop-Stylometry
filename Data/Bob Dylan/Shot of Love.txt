i need a shot of love
i need a shot of love


don’t need a shot of heroin to kill my disease
don’t need a shot of turpentine, only bring me to my knees
don’t need a shot of codeine to help me to repent
don’t need a shot of whiskey, help me be president


i need a shot of love
i need a shot of love


doctor, can you hear me? i need some medicaid
i seen the kingdoms of the world and it’s making me feel afraid
what i got ain’t painful, it’s just bound to kill me dead
like the men that followed jesus when they put a price upon his head


i need a shot of love
i need a shot of love


i don’t need no alibi when i’m spending time with you
i’ve heard all of them rumors and you have heard them too
don’t show me no picture show or give me no book to read
it don’t satisfy the hurt inside nor the habit that it feeds


i need a shot of love
i need a shot of love


why would i want to take your life?
you’ve only murdered my father, raped his wife
tattooed my babies with a poison pen
mocked my god, humiliated my friends


i need a shot of love
i need a shot of love


don’t want to be with nobody tonight
veronica not here, mavis just ain’t right
there’s a man that hates me and he’s swift, smooth and near
am i supposed to set back and wait until he’s here?


i need a shot of love
i need a shot of love


what makes the wind want to blow tonight?
don’t even feel like crossing the street and my car ain’t actin’ right
called home, everybody seemed to have moved away
my conscience is beginning to bother me today


i need a shot of love
i need a shot of love


i need a shot of love, i need a shot of love
if you’re a doctor, i need a shot of love
