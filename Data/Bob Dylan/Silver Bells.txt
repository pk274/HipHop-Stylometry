city sidewalk, busy sidewalks dressed in holiday style
in the air there's a feeling of christmas
children laughing, people passing, meeting smile after smile
and on every street corner you'll hear


silver bells, silver bells
it's christmas time in the city
ring-a-ling, hear them ring
soon it will be christmas day


city street lights, even stop lights blink a bright red and green
as the shoppers rush home with their treasures
hear the snow crunch, see the kids bunch, this is santa's big scene
and above all this bustle you'll hear


silver bells, silver bells
it's christmas time in the city
ring-a-ling, hear them ring
soon it will be christmas day
