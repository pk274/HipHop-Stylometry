they sat together in the park
as the evening sky grew dark
she looked at him and he felt a spark, tingle to his bones
'twas then he felt alone and wished that he'd gone straight
and watched out for a simple twist of fate


they walked along by the old canal
a little confused, i remember well
and stopped into a strange hotel with a neon burnin' bright
he felt the heat of her night, hit him like a freight train
moving with a simple twist of fate


a saxophone someplace far off played
as she was walkin' by the arcade
as the light bust through a beat-up shade where he was wakin' up
she dropped a coin into the cup of a blind man at the gate
and forgot about a simple twist of fate


he woke up, the room was bare
he didn't see her anywhere
he told himself he didn't care, pushed the window open wide
felt an emptiness inside, to which he just could not relate
brought on by a simple twist of fate


he hears the ticking of the clocks
and walks along with a parrot that talks
hunts her down by the waterfront docks where the sailors all come in
maybe he'll spot her once again, how long must he wait
one more for a simple twist of fate


people tell me it's a sin
to know and feel too much within
i still believe she was my twin, but i lost the ring
she was born in spring, but i was born too late
blame it on a simple twist of fate
