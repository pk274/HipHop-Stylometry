i paid fifteen million dollars, twelve hundred and seventy-two cents
i paid one thousand two hundred twenty-seven dollars and fifty-five cents
see my hound dog bite a rabbit
and my football’s sitting on a barbed-wire fence


yes, my temperature rises and my feet don’t walk so fast
yes, my temperature rises and my feet don’t walk so fast
well, this arabian doctor came in, gave me a shot
but wouldn’t tell me if what i had would last


well, this woman i’ve got, she’s filling me with her drive
yes, this woman i’ve got, she’s thrilling me with her hive
she’s calling me stan
or else she calls me mister clive


of course, you’re gonna think this song is a riff
i know you’re gonna think this song is a cliff
unless you’ve been inside a tunnel
and fell down 69, 70 feet over a barbed-wire fence


all night!
