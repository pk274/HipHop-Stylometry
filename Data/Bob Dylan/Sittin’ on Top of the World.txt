was in the summer
one early fall
just tryin' to find my
little all and all
now she's gone
and i don't worry
lord, i'm sitting on top of the world


was in the spring
one summer's day
just when she left me
she gone to stay
now she's gone
and i don't worry
lord, i'm sitting on top of the world


now don't come running
holding up your hand
can get me a woman
quick as you can get a man
now she's gone
and i don't worry
lord, i'm sitting on top of the world


happen for days
didn't know your name
why should i worry
or crave you in vain?
now she's gone
i don't worry
lord, i'm sitting on top of the world


went to the station
down in the yard
gonna get me a freight train
work's done got hard
now she's gone
and i don't worry
lord, i'm sitting on top of the world


the lonesome days
they have gone by
why should i beg you?
you said goodbye
now she's gone
i don't worry
lord, i'm sitting on top of the world
