skylark, have you anything to say to me?
won't you tell me where my love can be?
is there a meadow in the mist
where someone's waiting to be kissed?


skylark, have you seen a valley green with spring?
where my heart can go a-journeying
over the shadows and the rain
to a blossom covered lane


and in your lonely flight
haven't you heard the music of the night?
wonderful music
faint as a will o' the wisp, crazy as a loon
sad as a gypsy serenading the moon


oh skylark, i don't know if you can find these things
but my heart is riding on your wings
so if you see them anywhere
won't you lead me there?
