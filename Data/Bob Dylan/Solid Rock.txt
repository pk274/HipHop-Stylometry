well, i’m hanging on to a solid rock
made before the foundation of the world
and i won’t let go, and i can’t let go, won’t let go
and i can’t let go, won’t let go and i can’t let go no more


for me he was chastised, for me he was hated
for me he was rejected by a world that he created
nations are angry, cursed are some
people are expecting a false peace to come


well, i’m hanging on to a solid rock
made before the foundation of the world
and i won’t let go, and i can’t let go, won’t let go
and i can’t let go, won’t let go and i can’t let go no more


it’s the ways of the flesh to war against the spirit
twenty-four hours a day you can feel it and you can hear it
using all the devices under the sun
and he never give up ’til the battle’s lost or won


well, i’m hanging on to a solid rock
made before the foundation of the world
and i won’t let go, and i can’t let go, won’t let go
and i can’t let go, won’t let go and i can’t let go no more
