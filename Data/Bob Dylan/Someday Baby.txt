i don't care what you do, i don't care what you say
i don't care where you go or how long you stay
someday baby, you ain't gonna worry po' me any more


well you take my money and you turn me out
you fill me up with nothing but self doubt
someday baby, you ain't gonna worry po' me anymore


when i was young, driving was my crave
you drive me so hard, almost to the grave
someday baby, you ain't gonna worry po' me anymore


i'm so hard pressed, my mind tied up in knots
i keep recycling the same old thoughts
someday baby you ain't gonna worry po' me anymore


so many good things in life that i overlooked
i don't know what to do now, baby you got me so hooked
someday baby you ain't gonna worry po' me any more


well, i don't want to brag, i'm gonna ring your neck
when all else fails i'll make it a matter of self-respect
someday baby, you ain't gonna worry po' me any more


you can take your clothes put em in a sack
you goin' down the road, baby and you can't come back
someday baby you ain't gonna worry po' me any more


i tried to be friendly, i tried to be kind
i'm gonna drive you from your home, just like i was driven from mine
someday baby you ain't gonna worry po' me any more


living this way ain't a natural thing to do
why was i born to love you?
someday baby, you ain't gonna worry po' me any more
