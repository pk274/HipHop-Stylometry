they say, “eat, drink and be merry
take the bull by the horns”
i keep seeing visions of you, a lily among thorns
everything looks a little far away to me


getting harder and harder to recognize the trap
too much information about nothing
too much educated rap
it’s just like you told me, just like you said it would be


the moon rising like wildfire
i feel the breath of a storm
something i got to do tonight
you go inside and stay warm


someone’s got a hold of my heart
someone’s got a hold of my heart
someone’s got a hold of my heart
you
yeah, you got a hold of my heart


just got back from a city of flaming red skies
everybody thinks with their stomach
there’s plenty of spies
every street is crooked, they just wind around till they disappear


madame butterfly, she lulled me to sleep
like an ancient river
so wide and deep
she said, “be easy, baby, ain’t nothin’ worth stealing in here”


you’re the one i’ve been waiting for
you’re the one i desire
but you must first realize
i’m not another man for hire




i can hear that hot-blooded singer
on the bandstand croon
poisoned love, red roses for a blue lady and memphis in june
while they’re beating the devil out of a guy who’s wearing a powder blue wig


i been to babylon
i gotta confess
i could still hear the voice crying in the wilderness
what looks large from a distance, close up is never that big
never could learn to drink that blood and call it wine
never could learn to look at your face and call it mine
