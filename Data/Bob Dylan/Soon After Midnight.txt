i'm searching for phrases to sing your praises
i need to tell someone
it's soon after midnight
and my day has just begun


a gal named honey took my money
she was passing by
it's soon after midnight
and the moon is in my eye


my heart is cheerful, it's never fearful
i've been down on the killing floors
i'm in no great hurry, i'm not afraid of your fury
i've faced stronger walls than yours


charlotte's a harlot, dresses in scarlet
mary dresses in green
it's soon after midnight
and i've got a date with the fairy queen


they chirp and they chatter, what does it matter?
they're lying there dying in their blood
two-timing slim, who's ever heard of him?
i'll drag his corpse through the mud


it's now or never, more than ever
when i met you i didn't think you would do
it's soon after midnight
and i don't want nobody but you
