gypsy gal, the hands of harlem
cannot hold you to its heat
your temperature is too hot for taming
your flaming feet are burning up the street
i'm homeless, come and take me
to the reach of your rattlin' drums
let me know, babe, all about my fortune
down along my restless palms


gypsy gal, you got me swallowed
i have fallen far beneath
your pearly eyes, so fast and slashing
and your flashing diamond teeth
the night is pitch black, come an’ make my
pale face fit into place, ah, please!
let me know, babe, i’m nearly drowning
if it’s you my lifelines trace


i been wondering all about me
ever since i seen you there
on the cliffs of your wildcat charms i’m riding
i know i’m around you but i don’t know where
you have slayed me, you have made me
i got to laugh half ways off my heels
i got to know, babe, yeah will you surround me?
so i can know if i’m really real
