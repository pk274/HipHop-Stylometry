broke my heart, lost my soul
adios, mi corazón
spanish is the loving tongue
soft as music, light as spring
it was a girl i learned it from
living down sonora way

well, i don't look much like a lover
still i say her love words over
mostly when i'm all alone
mi amor, mi corazón


haven't seen her since that night
i can't cross the line you know
they want me for a gambling fight
like as not it's better so
still i always kind of missed her
since that last sad night i kissed her
broke her heart, lost my own
adios, mi corazón
broke her heart, lost my own
adios, mi corazón
adios, mi corazón
adios, mi corazón
