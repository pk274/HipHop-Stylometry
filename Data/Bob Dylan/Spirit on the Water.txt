spirit on the water
darkness on the face of the deep
i keep thinking about you baby
i can't hardly sleep


i'm traveling by land
traveling through the dawn of day
you're always on my mind
i can't stay away


i'd forgotten about you
then you turned up again
i always knew
that we were meant to be more than friends


when you are near
it's just as plain as it can be
i'm wild about you, gal
you ought to be a fool about me


can't explain
the sources of this hidden pain
you burned your way into my heart
you got the key to my brain


i've been trampling through mud
praying to the powers above
i'm sweating blood
you got a face that begs for love


life without you
doesn't mean a thing to me
if i can't have you
i'll throw my love into the deep blue sea


sometimes i wonder
why you can't treat me right
you do good all day
then you do wrong all night


when you're with me
i'm a thousand times happier than i could ever say
what does it matter
what price i pay


they brag about your sugar
brag about it all over town
put some sugar in my bowl
i feel like laying down


i'm pale as a ghost
holding a blossom on a stem
you ever seen a ghost? no
but you have heard of them


i see you there
i'm blinded by the colors i see
i take good care
of what belongs to me


i hear your name
ringing up and down the line
i'm saying it plain
these ties are strong enough to bind


your sweet voice
calls out from some old familiar shrine
i got no choice
can't believe these things would ever fade from your mind


i could live forever
with you perfectly
you don't ever
have to make a fuss over me


from east to west
ever since the world began
i only mean it for the best
i want to be with you any way i can


i been in a brawl
now i'm feeling the wall
i'm going away baby
i won't be back â€˜till fall


high on the hill
you can carry all my thoughts with you
you've numbed my will
this love could tear me in two


i wanna be with you in paradise
and it seems so unfair
i can't go to paradise no more
i killed a man back there


you think i'm over the hill
you think i'm past my prime
let me see what you got
we can have a whoppin' good time
