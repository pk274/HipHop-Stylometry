hawlin alley on a dark and drizzly night
billy lyons and stack-a-lee had one terrible fight
all about that john b. stetson hat


stack-a-lee walked to the bar-room, and he called for a glass of beer
turned around to billy lyons, said, "what are you doin' here?"
"waitin' for a train, please bring my woman home


"stack-a-lee, oh stack-a-lee. please don't take my life
got three little children and a-weepin', lovin' wife
you're a bad man, bad man, stack-a-lee."


"god bless your children and i'll take care of your wife
you stole my john b., now i'm bound to take your life."

stack-a-lee turned to billy lyons and he shot him right through the head
only taking one shot to kill billy lyons dead

sent for the doctor, well the doctor he did come
just pointed out stack-a-lee, said, "now what have you done?"
you're a bad man, bad man, stack-a-lee."

hawlin alley, thought i heard the bulldogs bark
it must have been old stack-a-lee stumbling in the dark
he's a bad man, gonna land him right back in jail


high police walked on to stack-a-lee, he was lying fast asleep
high police walked on to stack-a-lee, and he jumped forty feet
he's a bad man, gonna land him right back in jail


well they got old stack-a-lee and they laid him right back in jail
couldn't get a man around to go stack-a lee's bail

'round my bedside billy lyons began to creep."
