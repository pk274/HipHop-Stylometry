i'm walking through the summer nights
the jukebox playing low
yesterday everything was going too fast
today it's moving too slow
i got no place left to turn
i got nothing left to burn
don't know if i saw you if i would kiss you or kill you
it probably wouldn't matter to you anyhow
you left me standing in the doorway, crying
i got nothing to go back to now


the light in this place is so bad
making me sick in the head
all the laughter is just making me sad
the stars have turned cherry red
i'm strumming on my gay guitar
smoking a cheap cigar
the ghost of our old love has not gone away
don't look it like it will anytime soon
you left me standing in the doorway, crying
under the midnight moon


maybe they'll get me and maybe they won't
but not tonight and it won't be here
there are things i could say, but i don't
i know the mercy of god must be near
i've been riding a midnight train
got ice water in my veins
i would be crazy if i took you back
it would go up against every rule
you left me standing in the doorway, crying
suffering like a fool


when the last rays of daylight go down
buddy, youâ€™ll roll no more
i can hear the church bells ringing in the yard
i wonder who they're ringing for
i know i can't win
but my heart just won't give in
last night i danced with a stranger
but she just reminded me you were the one
you left me standing in the doorway, crying
in the dark land of the sun


i eat when i'm hungry, drink when i'm dry
and live my life on the square
and even if the flesh falls off of my face
i know someone will be there to care
it always means so much
even the softest touch
i see nothing to be gained by any explanation
there's no words that need to be said
you left me standing in the doorway, crying
blues wrapped around my head
