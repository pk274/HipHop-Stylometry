well, i’m standin' on the highway
tryin' to bum a ride, tryin' to bum a ride
tryin' to bum a ride
well, i’m standin' on the highway
tryin' to bum a ride, tryin' to bum a ride
tryin' to bum a ride
nobody seem to know me
everybody pass me by


well, i’m standin' on the highway
tryin' to hold up, tryin' to hold up
tryin' to hold up and be brave
well, i’m standin' on the highway
tryin' to hold up, tryin' to hold up and be brave
one road’s going to the bright lights
the other’s going down to my grave


well, i’m standin' on the highway
vision clear
well, i’m standin' on the highway
vision clear
everybody passin' me by
nobody seem to know i'm here


well, i’m lookin' down at two cards
they seem to be handmade
well, i’m lookin' down at two cards
they seem to be handmade
one looks like it’s the ace of diamonds
the other looks like it is the ace of spades


well, i’m standin' on the highway
watchin' my life roll by
well, i’m standin' on the highway
tryin' to bum a ride
well, i’m standin' on the highway
tryin' to bum a ride
