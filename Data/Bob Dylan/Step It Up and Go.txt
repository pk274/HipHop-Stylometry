got a little girl, little and low
she used to love me but she don't no more
she gotta step it up and go-yeah, go
can't stand pat, swear you gotta step it up and go


got a little girl, she stays upstairs
make a living by putting on airs
gotta step it up and go-yeah, man
can't stand pat, swear you gotta step it up and go


front door shut, back door too
blinds pulled down, what' cha gonna do?
gotta step it up and go-yeah, go
can't stand pat, swear you gotta step it up and go


got a little girl, her name is ball
give a little bit, she took it all
i said step it up and go-yeah, man
can't stand pat, swear you gotta step it up and go


me an' my baby walking down the street
telling everybody 'bout the chief of police
gotta step it up and go-yeah, go
can't stand pat, swear you gotta step it up and go


tell my woman i'll see her at home
ain't no lovin' since she been gone
gotta step it up and go-yeah, go
can't stand pat, swear you gotta step it up and go


well, i'll sing this verse, ain't gonna sing no more
hear my gal call me and i got to go
step it up and go-yeah, man
can't stand pat, swear you gotta step it up and go
