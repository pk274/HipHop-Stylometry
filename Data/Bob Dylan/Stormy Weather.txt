don't know why
theres no sun up in the sky
stormy weather
since my gal and i ain't together
keeps raining all the time


life is bare
gloom and misery everywhere
stormy weather
just can't get my poor old self together
i'm weary all the time
the time
so weary all of the time


when she went away
the blues walked in and they met
if she stays away that old rocking chair's bound to get me
all i do is pray the lord above is gonna let me
just walk in the sun once more


can't go on
everything i had is gone
stormy weather
since my gal and i ain't together
keeps raining all the time
keeps raining all of the time
