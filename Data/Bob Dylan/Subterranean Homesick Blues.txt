johnny's in the basement, mixin' up the medicine
i'm on the pavement, thinkin' about the government
the man in a trench coat, badge out, laid off
says he's got a bad cough, wants to get it paid off
look out kid, it's somethin' you did
god knows when, but you're doin' it again
you better duck down the alleyway, looking for a new friend
the man in the coon-skin cap in a pig pen
wants 11 dollar bills – you only got 10


maggie comes fleet foot, face full of black soot
talkin' that the heat put plants in the bed, but
phone's tapped anyway
maggie says the many say
they must bust in early may
orders from the d.a
look out kid, don't matter what you did
walk on your tip toes, don’t tie no bows
better stay away from those that carry around a fire hose
keep a clean nose, watch the plainclothes
you don't need a weather man to know which way the wind blows


oh, get sick, get well, hang around a ink well
hang bail, hard to tell if anything is gonna sell
try hard, get barred, get back, ride rail
get jailed, jump bail, join the army if you fail
look out kid, you're gonna get hit
by losers, cheaters, six-time users
hanging 'round the theaters
girl by the whirlpool's looking for a new fool
don't follow leaders, a-watch the parking meters


oh, get born, keep warm
short pants, romance
learn to dance, get dressed
get blessed, try to be a success
please her, please him, buy gifts
don't steal, don't lift
20 years of schoolin' and they put you on the day shift
look out kid, they keep it all hid
better jump down a manhole, light yourself a candle
don't wear sandals, try to avoid the scandals
don't want to be a bum, you better chew gum
the pump don't work 'cause the vandals took the handles
