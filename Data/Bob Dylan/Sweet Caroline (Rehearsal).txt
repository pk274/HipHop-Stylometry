where it began
i can't begin to know when
but then i know it's growing strong
was in the spring
and spring became the summer
who'd have believed you'd come along


hands, touchin' hands
reachin' out, touchin' me, touchin' you


sweet caroline
good times never seemed so good
i've been inclined
to believe they never would


but now i look at the night
and it don't seem so lonely
we fill it up with only two
and when i hurt
hurtin' runs off my shoulders
how can i hurt when holdin' you


warm, touchin' warm
reachin' out, touchin' me, touchin' you


sweet caroline
good times nevеr seemed so good
i've been inclined
to bеlieve they never would
oh no no


sweet caroline
good times never seemed so good
sweet caroline
i believe they never could
sweet caroline
good times never seemed so good
