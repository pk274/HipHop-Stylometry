one time in london i’d gone out for a walk
past a place called hyde park where people talk
’bout all kinds of different gods, they have their point of view
to anyone passing by, that’s who they’re talking to


there was someone on a platform talking to the folks
about the t.v. god and all the pain that it invokes
“it’s too bright a light,” he said, “for anybody’s eyes
if you’ve never seen one it’s a blessing in disguise”


i moved in closer, got up on my toes
two men in front of me were coming to blows
the man was saying something ’bout children when they’re young
being sacrificed to it while lullabies are being sung


“the news of the day is on all the time
all the latest gossip, all the latest rhyme
your mind is your temple, keep it beautiful and free
don’t let an egg get laid in it by something you can’t see”


“pray for peace!” he said. you could feel it in the crowd
my thoughts began to wander. his voice was ringing loud
“it will destroy your family, your happy home is gone
no one can protect you from it once you turn it on”


“it will lead you into some strange pursuits
lead you to the land of forbidden fruits
it will scramble up your head and drag your brain about
sometimes you gotta do like elvis did and shoot the damn thing out”


“it’s all been designed,” he said, “to make you lose your mind
and when you go back to find it, there’s nothing there to find
every time you look at it, your situation’s worse
if you feel it grabbing out for you, send for the nurse"


the crowd began to riot and they grabbed hold of the man
there was pushing, there was shoving and everybody ran
the t.v. crew was there to film it, they jumped right over me
later on that evening, i watched it on t.v
