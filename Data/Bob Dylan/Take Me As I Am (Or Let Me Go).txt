why must you always try to make me over ?
take me as i am or let me go
white lilies never grow on stalks of clover
take me as i am or let me go


you're trying to reshape me in a moment
in the image of someone you used to know
i won't be a stand-in for an old love
take me as i am or let me go


you've tried to change me ever since you've met me
take me as i am or let me go
if you cannot overlook my faults, forget me
take me as i am or let me go


you're trying to reshape me in a mould love
in the image of someone you used to know
but i won't be a stand-in for an old love
take me as i am or let me go
