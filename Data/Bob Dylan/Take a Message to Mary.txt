these are the words of a frontier lad
who lost his love when he turned bad


take a message to mary
but don't tell here where i am
take a message to mary
but don't say i'm in a jam
you can tell her that i had to see the world
tell her that my ship set sail
you can say she'd better not wait for me
but don't tell her i'm in jail, oh don't tell her i'm in jail


take a message to mary
but don't tell her what i've done
please, don't mention the stage coach
and the shot from a carried gun
you better tell her that i had to change my plans
and cancel out the wedding-day
but please, don't mention the lonely cell
where i'm gonna pine away, until my dying-day


take a message to mary
but don't tell her all you know
my heart is aching for mary
lord know i miss her so
just tell her that i went to timbukto
tell her i'm searching for gold
you can say she better find someone new
to cherish and to hold, oh lord, this cell is so cold
