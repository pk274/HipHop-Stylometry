well, i saw it advertised one day
that the bear mountain picnic was coming my way
"come along and take a trip
we'll bring you up there on a ship
bring the wife and family
bring the whole kids"
yippee


well, i run right down and bought a ticket
to this thing called the bear mountain picnic
little did i realize
i was in for a pleasant, funny surprise
had nothing to do with picnic
didn't come close to a mountain
and i hate bears


took the wife and kids down to the pier
there was six thousand people there
everybody had a ticket for the trip
"oh well," i said "it's a pretty big ship
besides, anyhow, the more the merrier"


well, we all got on, and what do you think?
that big old boat started to sink
more people kept a-piling on
that old ship was a-going down
funny way to start a picnic


well, i soon lost track of my kids and wife
so many people, i never saw in my life
that old ship was sinking down in the water
there was six thousand people trying to kill each other
dogs a-barking, cats a-screaming
women a-yelling, men a-flying, fists a-flying
paper flying, cops a-coming, me a-running
maybe we just better call off the picnic


i got shoved down, got pushed around
all i remember was a moanin' sound
don't remember one thing more
all i remember is waking up on the shore
my arms and legs were broken
my feet were splintered
my head was cracked
i couldn't walk
i couldn't talk, smell, feel
couldn't see
didn't know where i was
i was bald
quite lucky to be alive though


well, feeling like i just climbed out of my casket
i grabbed back hold of my picnic basket
took the wife and kids and started home
wishing i'd never got up that mornin'


now, i don't care just what you do
if you want a have a picnic, that's up to you
but don't tell me about it, i don't want to hear it
you see, i just lost all my picnic spirit
stay in my kitchen, have my own picnic
have a picnic in the bathroom


well, it don't seem to me quite so funny
what some people are going to do for money
there's a brand new gimmick every day
just to take somebody's money away
i think we ought to take some of these people
and put them on a boat, send them up to bear mountain
for a picnic
