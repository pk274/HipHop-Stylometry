so i run down most hurriedly
and joined up with the john birch society
i got me a secret membership card
and started off a-walking down the road
yee-hoo, i’m a real john bircher now!
look out you commies!


now we all agree with hitler’s views
although he killed six million jews
it don’t matter too much that he was a fascist
at least you can’t say he was a communist!
that’s to say like if you got a cold you take a shot of malaria


well, i woos looking everywhere for them gol-darned reds
i got up in the morning and looked under my bed
looked in the sink, behind the door
looked in the glove compartment of my car
couldn’t find them


i woos looking high and low for them reds everywhere
i woos looking in the sink and underneath the chair
i looked way up my chimney hole
i even looked deep down inside my toilet bowl
they got away


well, i woos sitting home alone and started to sweat
figured they woos in my t.v. set
peeked behind the picture frame
got a shock from my feet, hitting right up in the brain
them reds caused it!
i know they did them hard-core ones


well, i quit my job so i could work all alone
then i changed my name to sherlock holmes
followed some clues from my detective bag
and discovered they woos red stripes on the american flag!
that old betsy ross


well, i investigated all the books in the library
ninety percent of them gotta be burned away
i investigated all the people that i know
ninety-eight percent of them gotta go
the other two percent are fellow birchers just like me


now eisenhower, he’s a russian spy
lincoln, jefferson and that roosevelt guy
to my knowledge there’s just one man
that’s really a true american: george lincoln rockwell
i know for a fact he hates commies because he picketed the movie exodus


well, i finally started thinking straight
when i run out of things to investigate
couldn’t imagine doing anything else
so now i’m sitting home investigating myself!
hope i don’t find out anything hmm, great god!
