rambling out of the wild west
leaving the towns i love the best
thought i’d seen some ups and downs
'til i come into new york town
people going down to the ground
buildings going up to the sky


wintertime in new york town
the wind blowing snow around
walk around with nowhere to go
somebody could freeze right to the bone
i froze right to the bone
new york times said it was the coldest winter in seventeen years
i didn’t feel so cold then


i swung on to my old guitar
grabbed hold of a subway car
and after a rocking, reeling, rolling ride
i landed up on the downtown side
greenwich village


i walked down there and ended up
in one of them coffeehouses on the block
got on the stage to sing and play
man there said, “come back some other day
you sound like a hillbilly
we want folk singers here”


well, i got a harmonica job, begun to play
blowing my lungs out for a dollar a day
i blowed inside out and upside down
the man there said he loved my sound
he was raving about how he loved my sound
dollar a day’s worth


and after weeks and weeks of hanging around
i finally got a job in new york town
in a bigger place, bigger money too
even joined the union and paid my dues


now, a very great man once said
that some people rob you with a fountain pen
it didn’t take too long to find out
just what he was talkin’ about
a lot of people don’t have much food on their table
but they got a lot of forks ’n’ knives
and they got to cut something


so one morning when the sun was warm
i rambled out of new york town
pulled my cap down over my eyes
and headed out for the western skies
so long, new york
howdy, east orange
