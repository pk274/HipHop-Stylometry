tell me
tell me, i’ve got to know
tell me
tell me before i go
does that flame still burn, does that fire still glow?
or has it died out and melted like the snow?
tell me
tell me


tell me
are you goin’ somewhere and not sayin’ where?
tell me
do you even care?
tell me quick with a glance or a sigh
should i hold you close, should i let you go by?
tell me
ooh, tell me


are you looking at me and thinking of somebody else?
can you feel the heat and the beat of my pulse?
have you had any secrets that will only come out in time?
can you ever be just a stranger to me?
am i imagining something that ever can be?
tell me
ooh, tell me


tell me
do those neon lights blind your eyes?
tell me
behind what door your treasure lies
is my name written down there in your book?
should i come back and take another look?
tell me
tell me


do you think of yourself as somebody’s plaything or toy?
have you been like a waitress who says “what’ll it be boy?”
do you have any morals?
do you have any point of view?
have you ever longed to ride on that old ship of zion?
what’s better to you: a live dog or a dead lion?
tell me
tell me


tell me
ever gone broke in a big way?
tell me
ever do the opposite of what the experts say?
tell me the truth now, don’t tell me no lies
are you anybody somebody prays for or cries?
tell me
ooh, tell me
