i have heard rumors all over town
they say that you're planning to put me down
all i'd like you to do
is tell me that it isn't true


they say that you've been seen with some other man
that he's tall, dark and handsome, and you're holdin' his hand
darling, i'm a-countin' on you
tell me that it isn't true


to know that some other man is holdin' you tight
it hurts me all over, it doesn't seem right


all of these awful things that i have heard
i don't wanna believe them, all i want is your word
so, darlin', you better come through
tell me that it isn't true


all of these awful things that i have heard
i don't want to believe them, all i want is your word
so, darlin', i'm countin' on you
tell me that it isn't true
