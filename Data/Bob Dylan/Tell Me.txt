tell me--i’ve got to know
tell me--tell me before i go
does that flame still burn, does that fire still glow
or has it died out and melted like the snow
tell me
tell me


tell me--what are you focused upon
tell me--will it come to me after you're gone
tell me quick with a glance or a sigh
shall i hold you close or  let you go by
tell me
tell me


is that the heat and the beat of your pulse that i feel
if it's not that then what are you tryin' to conceal
do you have any secrets
that will only come out in time
do you lay in your bed
do you stare at the stars
is your main friend someone who’s an old acquaintance of ours
tell me
tell me


tell me--are those rock'n'roll dreams in your eyes
tell me--behind what door your treasure lies
ever gone broke in a big way
ever done the opposite of what the experts say
tell me
tell me


is this some kind of game that you’re playing’ with my heart
how deep must i go? when do i start?
do you have any morals
do you have any point of view
is that a smile that i see on your face
will it lead me to glory or lead me to disgrace
tell me
tell me


tell me--is that man's name in your book
tell me--will you go back and take another look
tell me the truth, don't tell me no lies
are you anybody's someone prays for or cries
tell me
tell me
