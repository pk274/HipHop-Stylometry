the pale moon rose in its glory
out o'er the western town
she told a sad, sad story
of the great ship that went down


t'was the fourteenth day of april
over the waves she rode
sailing into tomorrow
to a gilded age foretold


the night was black with starlight
the seas were sharp and clear
moving through the shadows
the promised hour was near


lights were holding steady
gliding over the foam
all the lords and ladies
heading for their eternal home


the chandeliers were swaying
from the balustrades above
the orchestra was playing
songs of faded love


the watchman, he lay dreaming
as the ballroom dancers twirled
he dreamed the titanic was sinking
into the underworld


leo took his sketchbook
he was often so inclined
he closed his eyes and painted
the scenery in his mind


cupid struck his bosom
and broke it with a snap
the closest woman to him
he fell into her lap


he heard a loud commotion
something sounded wrong
his inner spirit was saying
that he couldn't stand here long


he staggered to the quarterdeck
no time now to sleep
water on the quarterdeck
already three foot deep


smokestack was leaning sideways
heavy feet began to pound
he walked into the whirlwind
sky splitting all around


the ship was going under
the universe had opened wide
the roll was called up yonder
the angels turned aside


lights down in the hallway
flickering dim and dull
dead bodies already floating
in the double bottom hull


the engines then exploded
propellers they failed to start
the boilers overloaded
the ship's bow split apart


passengers were flying
backward, forward, far and fast
they mumbled, fumbled, and tumbled
each one more weary than the last


the veil was torn asunder
'tween the hours of twelve and one
no change, no sudden wonder
could undo what had been done


the watchman lay there dreaming
at forty-five degrees
he dreamed that the titanic was sinking
dropping to her knees


wellington he was sleeping
his bed began to slide
his valiant heart was beating
he pushed the tables aside


glass of shattered crystal
lay scattered roundabout
he strapped on both his pistols
how long could he hold out?


his men and his companions
were nowhere to be seen
in silence there he waited for
time and space to intervene


the passageway was narrow
there was blackness in the air
he saw every kind of sorrow
heard voices everywhere


alarm-bells were ringing
to hold back the swelling tide
friends and lovers clinging
to each other side by side


mothers and their daughters
descending down the stairs
jumped into the icy waters
love and pity sent their prayers


the rich man, mister astor
kissed his darling wife
he had no way of knowing
be the last trip of his life


calvin, blake, and wilson
gambled in the dark
not one of them would ever live to
tell the tale or disembark


brother rose up 'gainst brother
in every circumstance
they fought and slaughtered each other
in a deadly dance


they lowered down the lifeboats
from the sinking wreck
there were traitors, there were turncoats
broken backs and broken necks


the bishop left his cabin
to help all those in need
turned his eyes up to the heavens
said, "the poor are yours to feed"


davey the brothel-keeper
came out dismissed his girls
saw the water getting deeper
saw the changing of his world


jim backus smiled
he never learned to swim
saw the little crippled child
and he gave his seat to him


he saw the starlight shining
streaming from the east
death was on the rampage
but his heart was now at peace


they battened down the hatches
but the hatches wouldn't hold
they drowned upon the staircase
of brass and polished gold


leo said to cleo
i think i'm going mad
but he'd lost his mind already
whatever mind he had


he tried to block the doorway
to save all those from harm
blood from an open wound
pouring down his arm


petals fell from flowers
tell all of them were gone
in the long and dreadful hours
the wizard's curse played on


the host was pouring brandy
he was going down slow
he stayed right to the end and he
was the last to go


there were many, many others
nameless here forever more
they never sailed the ocean
or left their homes before


the watchman, he lay dreaming
the damage had been done
he dreamed the titanic was sinking
and he tried to tell someone


the captain, barely breathing
kneeling at the wheel
above him and beneath him
fifty thousand tons of steel


he looked over at his compass
and he gazed into its face
needle pointing downward
he knew he lost the race


in the dark illumination
he remembered bygone years
he read the book of revelation
and he filled his cup with tears


when the reaper's task had ended
sixteen hundred had gone to rest
the good, the bad, the rich, the poor
the loveliest and the best


they waited at the landing
and they tried to understand
but there is no understanding
for the judgment of god's hand


the news came over the wires
and struck with deadly force
the love had lost its fires
all things had run their course


the watchman he lay dreaming
of all the things that can be
he dreamed the titanic was sinking
into the deep blue sea
