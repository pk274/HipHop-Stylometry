up in the mornin', out on the job
work like the devil for my pay
but that lucky old sun has nothin' to do
but roll 'round heaven all day


fuss with my woman, toil for my kids
sweat 'til i'm wrinkled and gray
while that lucky old sun has nothin' to do
but roll 'round heaven all day


good lord above, can't you see i'm pining
tears in my eyes
send down that cloud with a silver lining
lift me to paradise

show me that river, take me across
and wash all my trouble away
like that lucky old sun, give me nothin' to do
but roll 'round heaven all day


oh lord above, can't you know i'm pining
tears in my eyes
send down that cloud with a silver lining
lift me to paradise

show me that river, take me across
and wash all my trouble away
like that lucky old sun, give me nothin' to do
but roll 'round heaven all day
