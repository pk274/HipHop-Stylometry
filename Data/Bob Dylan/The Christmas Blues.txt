the jingle bells are jingling
the streets are white with snow
the happy crowds are mingling
but there's no one that i know

i'm sure that you'll forgive me
if i don't enthuse
i guess i got the christmas blues


i've done my window shopping
there's not a store i missed
but what's the use of stoppin'
when there's no one on your list

you'll know the way i'm feeling
when you love and you lose
i guess i've got the christmas blues


when somebody wants you
somebody needs you
christmas is a joy of joys
but friends, when you're lonely
you'll find that it's only
a thing for little girls and little boys


may all your days be merry
your seasons full of cheer
but till it's january
i'll just go and disappear


old santa may have brought you
some stars for your shoes
but santa only brought me the blues
those brightly packaged
tinsel covered christmas blues


old santa may have brought you
some stars for your shoes
but santa only brought me the blues
those brightly packaged
tinsel covered christmas blues
