all through the year we waited
waited through spring and fall
to hear silver bells ringing
see winter time bringing
the happiest season of all


chestnuts roasting on an open fire
jack frost nipping at your nose
yuletide carols being sung by a choir
and folks dressed up like eskimos


everybody knows a turkey and some mistletoe
help to make the season bright
tiny little tots with their eyes all aglow
will find it hard to sleep tonight


they know that santa's on his way
he's loaded lots of toys on his sleigh
and every mother's child is gonna spy
to see if reindeer really know how to fly


and so i'm offering this simple phrase
to kids from one to ninety-two
although it's been said many times, many ways
merry christmas to you
