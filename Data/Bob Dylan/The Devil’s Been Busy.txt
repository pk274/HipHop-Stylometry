sometimes you think you're crazy
but you know you're only mad
sometimes you're better off not knowing
how much you've been had


you see your second cousin
wasted in a fight
you say he had it coming
he couldn't do it right
you're in a western movie
playing the part


sometimes they say you're wicked
but you know that can't be bad
sometimes you're better off not knowing
it'll only make you sad
