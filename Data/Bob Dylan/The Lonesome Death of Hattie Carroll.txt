william zanzinger killed poor hattie carroll
with a cane that he twirled around his diamond ring finger
at a baltimore hotel society gatherin'
and the cops was called in and his weapon took from him
as they rode him in custody down to the station
and booked william zanzinger for first-degree murder


but you who philosophize disgrace
and criticize all fears
take the rag away from your face
now ain't the time for your tears


william zanzinger, who at twenty-four years
owns a tobacco farm of six hundred acres
with rich wealthy parents who provide and protect him
and high office relations in the politics of maryland
reacted to his deed with a shrug of his shoulders
and swear words and sneering, and his tongue, it was a-snarling
and in a matter of minutes, on bail was out walking


but you who philosophize disgrace
and criticize fears
take the rag away from your face
now ain't the time for your tears


hattie carroll was a maid in the kitchen
she was fifty-one years old and gave birth to ten children
who carried the dishes and took out the garbage
and never sat once at the head of the table
and didn't even talk to the people at the table
who just cleaned up all the food from the table
and emptied the ashtrays on a whole other level
got killed by a blow, lay slain by a cane
that sailed through the air and came down through the room
doomed and determined to destroy all the gentle
and she never done nothin' to william zanzinger


and you who philosophize disgrace
and criticize all fears
take the rag away from your face
now ain't the time for your tears


in the courtroom of honor, the judge pounded his gavel
to show that all's equal and that the courts are on the level
and that the strings in the books ain't pulled and persuaded
and that even the nobles get properly handled
once that the cops have chased after and caught 'em
and that the ladder of law has no top and no bottom
stared at the person who killed for no reason
who just happened to be feelin' that way without warnin'
and he spoke through his cloak, most deep and distinguished
and handed out strongly, for penalty and repentance
william zanzinger with a six-month sentence


ah, but you who philosophize disgrace
and criticize all fears
bury the rag deep in your face
for now's the time for your tears
