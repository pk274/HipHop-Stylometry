there was a moon out in space
but a cloud drifted over its face
you kissed me and went on your way
the night we called it a day
i heard the song of the spheres
like a minor lament in my ears
i hadn't the heart left to pray
the night we called it a day


soft through the dark
the hoot of an owl in the sky
sad though his song
no bluer than he was i
the moon went down, stars were gone
but the sun didn't rise with the dawn
there wasn't a thing left to say
the night we called it a day
