i pulled into nazareth, was feeling about half past dead;
i just need some place where i can lay my head
"hey, mister, can you tell me where a man might find a bed?"
he just grinned and shook my hand, and "no!", was all he said


take a load off fanny, take a load for free;
take a load off fanny, and (and) (and) you can put the load right on me


i picked up my bag, i went looking for a place to hide;
when i saw carmen and the devil walking side by side
i said, "hey, carmen, come on, let's go downtown."
she said, "i gotta go, but m'friend can stick around."




go down, miss moses, there's nothing you can say
it's just ol' luke, and luke's waitin' on the judgement day
"well, luke, my friend, what about young anna lee?"
he said, "do me a favor, son, woncha stay and keep anna lee company?"




crazy chester followed me, and he caught me in the fog
he said, "i will fix your rack, if you'll take jack, my dog."
i said, "wait a minute, chester, you know i'm a peaceful man."
he said, "that's okay, boy, won't you feed him when you can."




catch a cannon ball now, t'take me down the line
my bag is sinking' low and i do believe it's time
to get back to miss fanny, you know she's the only one
who sent me here with her regards for everyone
