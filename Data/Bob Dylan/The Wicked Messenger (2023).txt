there was a wicked messenger, from eli he did come
with a mind that multiplied the smallest matter
when questioned who had sent for him, he answered with his thumb
for his tongue it couldn't speak, but only flatter


he stayed behind the assembly hall, 'cause there he made his bed
oftentimes he could be seen returning
until one day he just appeared with a notе in his hand which read
"the soles of my feet, i swеar they're burning"


oh, the leaves began to falling, the seas began to part
and the people that confronted him were many
and he was told but these few words, which opened up his heart
"if you cannot bring good news, don't bring any"
