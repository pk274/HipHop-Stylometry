there was a man named mahatma gandhi
he would not bow down he would not fight
he knew the deal was down and dirty
and nothing wrong could make it right away
but he knew his duty and the prize he had to pay
just another holy man who tried to be a friend
my god, they killed him


another man from atlanta, georgia
by name of martin luther king
he shook the land like the rolling thunder
and made the bells of freedom ring today
with a dream of beauty that they could not burn away
just another holy man who dared to make a stand
my god, they killed him


the only son of god almighty
the holy one called jesus christ
he healed the lame and fed the hungry
and for his love they took his life away
on the road to glory where the story never ends
just the holy son of man we'll never understand
my god, they killed him


there was a man named mahatma gandi
a man named martin luther king
the only son of god almighty
the only one called jesus christ
on the road to glory where the story never ends
just the holy son of man we'll never understand
my god, they killed him
