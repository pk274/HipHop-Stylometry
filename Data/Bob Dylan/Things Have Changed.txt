a worried man with a worried mind
no one in front of me and nothing behind
there’s a woman on my lap and she’s drinking champagne
got white skin, got assassin’s eyes
i’m looking up into the sapphire-tinted skies
i’m well dressed, waiting on the last train
standing on the gallows with my head in a noose
any minute now i’m expecting all hell to break loose


people are crazy and times are strange
i’m locked in tight, i’m out of range
i used to care, but things have changed


this place ain’t doing me any good
i’m in the wrong town, i should be in hollywood
just for a second there i thought i saw something move
gonna take dancing lessons, do the jitterbug rag
ain’t no shortcuts, gonna dress in drag
only a fool in here would think he’s got anything to prove
lot of water under the bridge; lot of other stuff, too
don’t get up, gentlemen, i’m only passing through


people are crazy and times are strange
i’m locked in tight, i’m out of range
i used to care, but things have changed


i’ve been walking forty miles of bad road
if the bible is right, the world will explode
i’ve been trying to get as far away from myself as i can
some things are too hot to touch
the human mind can only stand so much
you can’t win with a losing hand
feel like falling in love with the first woman i meet
putting her in a wheelbarrow and wheeling her down the street


people are crazy and times are strange
i’m locked in tight, i’m out of range
i used to care, but things have changed


i hurt easy, i just don’t show it
you can hurt someone and not even know it
the next sixty seconds could be like an eternity
gonna get low down, gonna fly high
all the truth in the world adds up to one big lie
i’m in love with a woman who don’t even appeal to me
mr. jinx and miss lucy, they jumped in the lake
i’m not that eager to make a mistake


people are crazy and times are strange
i’m locked in tight, i’m out of range
i used to care, but things have changed
