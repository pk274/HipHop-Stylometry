how long can i stay in this nowhere caf√©
before night turns into day
i wonder why i'm so frightened of dawn
all i have and all i know
is this dream of you
which keeps me living on


there's a moment when all old things
become new again
but that moment might have come and gone
all i have and all i know
is this dream of you
which keeps me living on


i look away, but i keep seeing it
i don't want to believe, but i keep believing it
shadows dance upon the wall
shadows that seem to know it all


am i too blind to see, is my heart playing tricks on me
i'm lost in the crowd
all my tears are gone
all i have and all i know
is this dream of you
which keeps me living on


everything i touch seems to disappear
everywhere i turn you are always here
i'll run this race until my earthly death
i'll defend this place with my dying breath


from a cheerless room in a curtained gloom
i saw a star from heaven fall
i turned and looked again but it was gone
all i have and all i know
is this dream of you
which keeps me living on
