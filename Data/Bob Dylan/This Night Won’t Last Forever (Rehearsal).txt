everybody likes a celebration
happy music and conversation
i'd be lying if i said i never got the blues

in the corner there's a couple dancing
from the kitchen i can hear 'em laughing
oh i wish i was celebrating too


i know this night won't last forever
i know the sun's got to shine sometime
i got some hope for a bright tomorrow
i know this heart gonna mend just fine


so pardon me the disposition
wish i didn't have to sit and listen
they're playing the same old songs on the radio

i wish i didn't have to sit and listеn
and be reminded of what i'm missing
no i'd rathеr be lonesome all alone


i know this night won't last forever
i know the sun's got to shine sometime
i got some hope for a bright tomorrow
i know this heart gonna mend just fine


suddenly, a strange vibration
from my head to my toes
filling me with a warm sensation
somebody's letting me know, yeah


it isn't right to be so downhearted
telling me that the party started
and i got some celebrating to do


hey i know this night won't last, can't forever
i know the sun's got to shine sometime
now i got some hope for a bright, such a bright tomorrow
i know this heart gonna mend just fine
