well, i had to move fast
and i couldn’t with you around my neck
i said i’d send for you and i did
what did you expect?
my hands are sweating
and we haven’t even started yet
i’ll go along with the charade
until i can think my way out
i know it was all a big joke
whatever it was about
someday maybe
i’ll remember to forget


i’m going to get my coat
i feel the breath of a storm
there’s something i’ve got to do tonight
you go inside and stay warm


has anybody seen my love?
has anybody seen my love?
has anybody seen my love?
i don’t know
has anybody seen my love?


you want to talk to me
go ahead and talk
whatever you got to say to me
won’t comе as any shock
i must be guilty of something
you just whisper it into my еar
madame butterfly
she lulled me to sleep
in a town without pity
where the water runs deep
she said, “be easy, baby
there is nothing worth stealing in here”


you’re the one i’ve been looking for
you’re the one that’s got the key
but i can’t figure out whether i’m too good for you
or you’re too good for me


has anybody seen my love?
has anybody seen my love?
has anybody seen my love?
i don’t know
has anybody seen my love?


well, they’re not showing any lights tonight
and there’s no moon
there’s just a hot-blooded singer
singing “memphis in june”
while they’re beating the devil out of a guy
who’s wearing a powder-blue wig
later he’ll be shot
for resisting arrest
i can still hear his voice crying
in the wilderness
what looks large from a distance
close up is never that big


never could learn to drink that blood
and call it wine
never could learn to hold you, love
and call you mine


has anybody seen my love?
has anybody seen my love?
has anybody seen my love?
i don’t know
has anybody seen my love?
