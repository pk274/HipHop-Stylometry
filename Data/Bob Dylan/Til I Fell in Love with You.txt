well, my nerves are exploding and my body’s tense
i feel like the whole world got me pinned up against the fence
i’ve been hit too hard, i’ve seen too much
nothing can heal me now, but your touch
i don’t know what i’m gonna do
i was all right ’til i fell in love with you


well, my house is on fire, burning to the sky
i thought it would rain but the clouds passed by
now i feel like i’m coming to the end of my way
but i know god is my shield and he won’t lead me astray
still i don’t know what i’m gonna do
i was all right ’til i fell in love with you


boys in the street beginning to play
girls like birds flying away
when i’m gone you will remember my name
i’m gonna win my way to wealth and fame
i don’t know what i’m gonna do
i was all right ’til i fell in love with you


junk is piling up, taking up space
my eyes feel like they’re falling off my face
sweat falling down, i’m staring at the floor
i’m thinking about that girl who won’t be back no more
i just don't know what to do
i was all right ’til i fell in love with you


well, i’m tired of talking, i’m tired of trying to explain
my attempts to please you were all in vain
tomorrow night before the sun goes down
if i’m still among the living, i’ll be dixie bound
i just don’t know what i’m gonna do
i was all right ’til i fell in love with you
