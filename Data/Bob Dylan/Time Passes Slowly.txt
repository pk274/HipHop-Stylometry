time passes slowly up here in the mountains
we sit beside bridges and walk beside fountains
catch the wild fishes that float through the stream
time passes slowly when you’re lost in a dream


once i had a sweetheart, she was fine and good-looking
we sat in her kitchen while her mama was cooking
stared out the window to the stars high above
time passes slowly when you’re searching for love


time passes slowly up here in the daylight
we stare straight ahead and try so hard to stay right
like the red rose of summer that blooms in the day
time passes slowly and fades away
