to be alone with you
just you and i
under the moon
'neath the star-spangled sky
i know you're alive
and i am too
my one desire
is to be alone with you


to be alone with you
even for just an hour
in a castle high
in an ivory tower
some people don't get it
they just don't have a clue
they wouldn't know what it's like
to be alone with you


they say that nighttime is the right time
to hold each other tight
all our worldly cares will disappear
and everything will come out right
i wish the night was here
make me scream and shout
i'd fall into your arms
i'd let it all hang out
i'll hound you to death
that's just what i'll do
i won't sleep away
'til i'm alone with you


i'm collecting my thoughts in a pattern
moving from place to place
stepping out into the dark night
stepping out in the streets
oh, what happened to me, darling?
what was it you saw?
did i kill somebody?
did i escape the law?
got my heart in my mouth
my eyes are still blue
my mortal bliss
is to be alone with you
my mortal bliss
is to be alone with you
