come closer
shut softly your watery eyes
the pangs of your sadness
will pass as your senses will rise
oh the flowers of the city
though breath-like
get death-like at times
and there’s no use in trying
to deal with the dying
though i cannot explain that in lines


your cracked country lips
i still wish to kiss
as to be by the strength of your skin
your magnetic movements
still capture the minutes i’m in
but it grieves my heart, love
to see you trying to be a part of
a world that just don’t exist
it’s all just a dream, babe
a vacuum, a scheme, babe
that sucks you into feelin' like this


i can see that your head
has been twisted and fed
with the worthless foam from the mouth
i can tell you are torn
between staying and returning
back to the south
you’ve been fooled into thinking
that the finishing end is at hand
yet there’s no one to beat you
no one to defeat you
'cept the thoughts of yourself feeling bad


i’ve heard you say many times
that you’re better than no one
and no one is better than you
if you really believe that
you know you have nothing to win and nothing to lose
from fixtures and forces and friends
your sorrow does stem
that hype you and type you
making you feel
that you gotta' be just like them


i’d forever talk to you
but soon my words
would turn into a meaningless ring
for deep in my heart
i know there's no help i can bring
everything passes
everything changes
just do what you think you should do
and someday maybe
who knows, baby
i’ll come and be crying to you
