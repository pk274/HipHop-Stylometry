if today was not a crooked highway
if tonight i could finally stand tall
if tomorrow wasn’t such a long time
then lonesome would mean nothing to me at all
yes, and only if my own true love was waitin’
yes, and if i could hear her heart a-softly poundin’
only if she was lyin’ by me
then i’d lie in my bed once again


i can’t see my reflection in the waters
i can’t speak the sounds that know no pain
i can’t hear the echo of my footsteps
i can’t remember the sound of my own name
yes, and only if my own true love was waitin’
yes, and if i could hear her heart a-softly poundin’
only if she was lyin’ by me
then i’d lie in my bed once again


there’s beauty in the silver, singin’ river
there’s beauty in the sunrise in the sky
but none of these and nothing else can match the beauty
that i remember in my true love’s eyes
yes, and only if my own true love was waitin’
if i could hear her heart a-softly poundin’
only if she was lyin’ by me
then i’d lie in my bed once again


yes, and only if my own true love was waitin’
if i could hear her heart a-softly poundin’
yes, and only if she was lyin’ by me
then i’d lie in my bed once again
