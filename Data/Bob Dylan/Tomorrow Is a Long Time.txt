if today was not a crooked highway
if tonight was not a crooked trail
if tomorrow wasn’t such a long time
then lonesome would mean nothing to you at all
yes, and only if my own true love was waiting
and if i could hear her heart a-softly pounding
yes, and only if she was lying by me
then i’d lie in my bed once again....


i can’t see my reflection in the waters
i can’t speak the sounds that show no pain
i can’t hear the echo of my footsteps
or can’t remember the sound of my own name
yes, and only if my own true love was waiting
and if i could hear her heart a-softly pounding
yes, and only if she was lying by me
then i’d lie in my bed once again...


there’s beauty in that silver, singing river
there’s beauty in the sunrise in the sky
but none of these and nothing else can touch the beauty
that i remember in my true love’s eyes
yes, and only if my own true love was waiting
and if i could hear her heart a-softly pounding
yes, and only if she was lying by me
then i’d lie in my bed once again...
