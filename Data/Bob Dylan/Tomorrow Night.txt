tomorrow night
will you remember what you said tonight?
tomorrow night
will all the thrill be gone?


tomorrow night
will it be just another memory
or just another song
that's in my heart to linger on?


your lips are so tender
your heart is beating fast
and you willingly surrender
to me, my darling, will it last?


tomorrow night
will you be with me when the moon is bright?
tomorrow night
will you say those lovely things you said tonight?


your lips are so tender
your heart is beating fast
and you willingly surrender
to me, my darling, will it last?


tomorrow night
will you be with me when the moon is bright?
tomorrow night
will you say those lovely things you said tonight?
