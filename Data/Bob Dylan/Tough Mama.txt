tough mama
meat shaking on your bones
i’m gonna go down to the river and get some stones
sister’s on the highway with that steel-drivin’ crew
papa’s in the big house, his working’ days are through
tough mama
can i blow a little smoke on you?


dark beauty
won’t you move over and give me some room?
it’s my duty to bring you down to the field where the flowers bloom
ashes in the furnace, dust on the rise
you came through it all the way, flying through the skies
dark beauty
with that long night’s journey in your eyes


sweet goddess
born of a blinding light and a changing wind
now, don’t be modest, you know who you are and where you’ve been
jack the cowboy went up north
he’s buried in your past
the lone wolf went out drinking
that was over pretty fast
sweet goddess
your perfect stranger’s comin’ on in at last


silver angel
with the badge of the lonesome road written on your sleeve
i’d be grateful if this golden ring you'd receive
today on the countryside it was a-hotter than a crotch
i stood alone upon the ridge and all i did was watch
sweet goddess
it must be time to carve another notch


i’m crestfallen
the world of illusion's at my door
i ain’t a-hauling any of my lambs to the marketplace anymore
the prison walls are crumbling down, there is no end in sight
i’ve gained some recognition but i lost my appetite
sweet beauty
meet me at the border late tonight
