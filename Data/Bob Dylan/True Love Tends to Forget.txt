i’m getting weary looking in my baby’s eyes
when she’s near me she’s so hard to recognize
i finally realize there’s no room for regret
true love, true love, true love tends to forget


hold me, baby be near
you told me that you’d be sincere
every day of the year’s like playing’ russian roulette
true love, true love, true love tends to forget


i was lying’ down in the reeds without any oxygen
i saw you in the wilderness among the men
saw you drift into infinity and come back again
all you got to do is wait and i’ll tell you when


you’re a tearjerker, baby, but i’m under your spell
you’re a hard worker, baby, and i know you well
but this weekend in hell is making me sweat
true love, true love, true love tends to forget


i was lying’ down in the reeds without any oxygen
i saw you in the wilderness among the men
saw you drift into infinity and come back again
all you got to do is wait and i’ll tell you when


you belong to me, baby, without any doubt
don’t forsake me, baby, don’t sell me out
don’t keep me knocking’ about from mexico to tibet
true love, true love, true love tends to forget
