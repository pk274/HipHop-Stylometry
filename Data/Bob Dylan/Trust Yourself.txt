trust yourself
trust yourself to do the things that only you know best
trust yourself
trust yourself to do what’s right and not be second-guessed
don’t trust me to show you beauty
when beauty may only turn to rust
if you need somebody you can trust, trust yourself


trust yourself
trust yourself to know the way that will prove true in the end
trust yourself
trust yourself to find the path where there is no if and when
don’t trust me to show you the truth
when the truth may only be ashes and dust
if you want somebody you can trust, trust yourself


well, you’re on your own, you always were
in a land of wolves and thieves
don’t put your hope in ungodly man
or be a slave to what somebody else believes


trust yourself
and you won’t be disappointed when vain people let you down
trust yourself
and look not for answers where no answers can be found
don’t trust me to show you love
when my love may be only lust
if you want somebody you can trust, trust yourself
