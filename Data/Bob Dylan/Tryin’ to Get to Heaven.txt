the air is getting hotter
there’s a rumbling in the skies
i’ve been wading through the high muddy water
with the heat rising in my eyes
every day your memory grows dimmer
it doesn’t haunt me like it did before
i’ve been walking through the middle of nowhere
trying to get to heaven before they close the door


when i was in missouri
they would not let me be
i had to leave there in a hurry
i only saw what they let me see
you broke a heart that loved you
now you can seal up the book and not write anymore
i’ve been walking that lonesome valley
trying to get to heaven before they close the door


people on the platforms
waiting for the trains
i can hear their hearts a-beatin’
like pendulums swinging on chains
when you think that you've lost everything
you find out you can always lose a little more
i’m just going down the road feeling bad
trying to get to heaven before they close the door


i’m going down the river
down to new orleans
they tell me everything is gonna be all right
but i don’t know what “all right” even means
i was riding in a buggy with miss mary-jane
miss mary-jane got a house in baltimore
i been all around the world, boys
now i’m trying to get to heaven before they close the door


gonna sleep down in the parlor
and relive my dreams
i’ll close my eyes and i wonder
if everything is as hollow as it seems
some trains don't pull no gamblers
no midnight ramblers like they did before
i been to sugar town, i shook the sugar down
now i’m trying to get to heaven before they close the door
