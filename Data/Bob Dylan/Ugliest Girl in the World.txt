the woman that i love she got a hook in her nose
her eyebrows meet, she wears second hand clothes
she speaks with a stutter and she walks with a hop
i don't know why i love her but i just can't stop


you know i love her
yeah i love her
i'm in love with the ugliest girl in the world


if i ever lose her i will go insane
i go half crazy when she calls my name
when she says baby i l-l-love you
there ain't nothing in the world that i wouldn't do




the woman that i love she got two flat feet
her knees knock together walking down the street
she cracks her knuckles and she snores in bed
she ain't much to look at but like i said




i don't mean to say that she got nothing going
she got a weird sense of humor that's all her own
when i get low she sets me on my feet
got a five inch smile but her breath is sweet




the woman that i love she a got a prizefighter nose
cauliflower ears and a run in her hose
she speaks with a stutter and she walks with a hop
i don't know why i love her but i just can't stop
