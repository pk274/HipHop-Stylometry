something’ about you that i can’t shake
don’t know how much more of this i can take
baby, i’m under your spell


i was knocked out and loaded in the naked night
when my last dream exploded, i noticed your light
baby, oh what a story i could tell

it’s been nice seeing you, you read me like a book
if you ever want to reach me, you know where to look
baby, i’ll be at the same hotel


i’d like to help you but i’m in a bit of a jam
i’ll call you tomorrow if there’s phones where i am
baby, caught between heaven and hell

but i will be back, i will survive
you’ll never get rid of me as long as you’re alive
baby, can’t you tell


well it’s four in the morning by the sound of the birds
i’m staring’ at your picture, i’m hearing’ your words
baby, they ring in my head like a bell


everywhere you go it’s enough to break hearts
someone always gets hurt, a fire always starts
you were too hot to handle, you were breaking every vow
i trusted your baby, you can trust me now


turn back baby, wipe your eye
don’t think i’m leaving here without a kiss goodbye
baby, is there anything left to tell?

i’ll see you later when i’m not so out of my head
maybe next time i’ll let the dead bury the dead
baby, what more can i tell?


well the desert is hot, the mountain is cursed
pray that i don’t die of thirst
baby, two feet from the well
