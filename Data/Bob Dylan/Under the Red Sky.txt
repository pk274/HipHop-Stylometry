there was a little boy and there was a little girl
and they lived in an alley under the red sky
there was a little boy and there was a little girl
and they lived in an alley under the red sky

one summer’s day he came passing by
there was an old man and he lived in the moon
and one day he came passing by


someday little girl, everything for you is gonna be new
someday little girl, you’ll have a diamond as big as your shoe


let the wind blow low, let the wind blow high
one day the little boy and the little girl were both baked in a pie
let the wind blow low, let the wind blow high
one day the little boy and the little girl were baked in a pie


this is the key to the kingdom and this is the town
this is the blind horse that leads you around


let the bird sing, let the bird fly
one day the man in the moon went home and the river went dry
let the bird sing, let the bird fly
the man in the moon went home and the river went dry
