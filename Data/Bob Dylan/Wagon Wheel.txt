you don't know but i've been doing fine
seems i'm looking at the moon tonight
i don't care what she's gonna do tonight, rollin'
look now, molly since you said goodbye
here i've been thinking, and wonderin' why
i know it's alright but i don't cry, no


rock me mama like the wind and the rain
rock me mama like a south bound train
hey mama rock me
rock me mama like a wagon wheel
rock me mama any way you feel
hey mama rock me
rock me mama like the wind and the rain
rock me mama like a south bound train
hey mama rock me


rock me mama through the wind and the rain
rock me mama like a south bound train
hey mama rock me
rock me mama like a wagon wheel
rock me mama any way you feel
hey mama rock me
rock me mama like the wind and the rain
rock me mama like a south bound train
hey mama rock me
rock me mama like a wagon wheel
rock me mama any way you feel
hey mama rock me


moonshine running on the rio grande
stars lie dotted on the promised land
it's all well talkin' and understandin', rollin'
when i'm looking on the road tonight
the moon is shining on a cold dark night
and oh that feeling, i know


rock me mama through the wind and the rain
rock me mama like a south bound train
hey mama rock me
rock me mama like a wagon wheel
rock me mama any way you feel
hey mama rock me
rock me mama like the wind and the rain
rock me mama like a south bound train
hey mama rock me
