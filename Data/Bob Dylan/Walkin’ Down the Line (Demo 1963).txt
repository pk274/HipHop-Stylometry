well, i’m walking down the line
i’m walking down the line
an’ i’m walking down the line
my feet’ll be a-flying
to tell about my troubled mind


i got a heavy-headed gal
i got a heavy-headed gal
i got a heavy-headed gal
she ain’t a-feelin’ well
when she’s better only time will tell


well, i’m walking down the line
i’m walking down the line
an’ i’m walking down the line
my feet’ll be a-flying
to tell about my troubled mind


my money comes and goes
my money comes and goes
my money comes and goes
and rolls and flows and rolls and flows
through the holes in the pockets in my clothes


well, i’m walking down the line
i’m walking down the line
an’ i’m walking down the line
my feet’ll be a-flying
to tell about my troubled mind


i see the morning light
i see the morning light
well, it’s not because
i’m an early riser
i didn’t go to sleep last night


well, i’m walking down the line
i’m walking down the line
an’ i’m walking down the line
my feet’ll be a-flying
to tell about my troubled mind


i got my walking shoes
i got my walking shoes
i got my walking shoes
an’ i ain’t a-gonna lose
i believe i got the walking blues


well, i’m walking down the line
i’m walking down the line
an’ i’m walking down the line
my feet’ll be a-flying
to tell about my troubled mind
