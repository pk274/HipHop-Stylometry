wallflower, wallflower
won’t you dance with me?
i’m sad and lonely too
wallflower, wallflower
won’t you dance with me?
i’m feeling’ in love with you


just like you, i’m wondering what i’m doing here
just like you, i’m wondering what’s going on




i have seen you standing in the smoky haze
and i know that you’re gonna be mine one of these days
mine alone
