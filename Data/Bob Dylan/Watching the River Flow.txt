what’s the matter with me
i don’t have much to say
daylight sneaking through the window
and i’m still in this all-night café
walking to and fro beneath the moon
out to where the trucks are rolling slow
to sit down on this bank of sand
and watch the river flow


wish i was back in the city
instead of this old bank of sand
with the sun beating down over the chimney tops
and the one i love so close at hand
if i had wings and i could fly
i know where i would go
but right now i’ll just sit here so contentedly
and watch the river flow


people disagreeing on all just about everything, yeah
makes you stop and all wonder why
why only yesterday i saw somebody on the street
who just couldn’t help but cry
oh, this old river keeps on rolling, though
no matter what gets in the way and which way the wind does blow
and as long as it does i’ll just sit here
and watch the river flow


people disagreeing everywhere you look
makes you want to stop and read a book
why only yesterday i saw somebody on the street
that was really shook
but this old river keeps on rolling, though
no matter what gets in the way and which way the wind does blow
and as long as it does i’ll just sit here
and watch the river flow


watch the river flow
watching the river flow
watching the river flow
but i’ll sit down on this bank of sand
and watch the river flow
