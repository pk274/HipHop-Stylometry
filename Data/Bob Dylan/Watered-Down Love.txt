love that’s pure hopes all things
believes all things, won’t pull no strings
won’t sneak up into your room, tall, dark and handsome
capture your soul and hold it for ransom


you don’t want a love that’s pure
you want to drown love
you want a watered-down love


love that’s pure, it don’t make no false claims
intercedes for you ’stead of casting you blame
will not deceive you or lead you into transgression
won’t write it up and make you sign a false confession


you don’t want a love that’s pure
you want to drown love
you want a watered-down love


love that’s pure won’t lead you astray
won’t hold it back, won’t get in your way
won’t pervert you, corrupt you with foolish wishes
will not make you envious or won't make you suspicious


you don’t want a love that’s pure
you want to drown love
you want a watered-down love


love that's pure's no accident
it knows that it knows, is always content
an eternal flame quietly burnin'
never needs to be proud, loud or restlessly yearnin'


you don’t want a love that’s pure
you want to drown love
you want a watered-down love
