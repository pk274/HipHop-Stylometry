i think we better talk this over
maybe when we both get sober
you’ll understand i’m only a man
doing’ the best that i can


this situation can only get rougher
why should we needlessly suffer?
let’s call it a day, go our own different ways
before we decay


you don’t have to be afraid of looking into my face
we’ve done nothing to each other time will not erase


i feel displaced, i got a low-down feeling
you been two-faced, you been double-dealing
i took a chance, got caught in the trance
of a downhill dance


oh, child, why you wanna hurt me?
i’m exiled, you can’t convert me
i’m lost in the haze of your delicate ways
with both eyes glazed


you don’t have to yearn for love, you don’t have to be alone
somewheres in this universe there’s a place that you can call home


i guess i’ll be leaving tomorrow
if i have to beg, steal or borrow
it’d be great to cross paths in a day and a half
look at each other and laugh


but i don’t think it’s liable to happen
like the sound of one hand clappin'
the vows that we kept are now broken and swept
’neath the bed where we slept


don’t think of me and fantasize on what we never had
be grateful for what we’ve shared together and be glad
why should we go on watching each other through a telescope?
eventually we’ll hang ourselves on all this tangled rope


oh, babe, time for a new transition
i wish i was a magician
i would wave a wand and tie back the bond
that we’ve both gone beyond
