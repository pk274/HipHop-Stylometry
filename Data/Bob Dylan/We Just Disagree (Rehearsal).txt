been away, haven't seen you in a while
how've you been, have you changed your style?
and do you think that we've grown up differently?
don't seem the same, seems you've lost your feel for me


so let's leave it alone, 'cause we can't see eye to eye
there ain't no good guy, there ain't no bad guy
there's only you and me and we just disagree
ooh-hoo-hoo, oh-oh-ho


i'm going back to a place that's far away
how bout you, have you got a place to stay?
why should i care when i'm just trying to get along?
we were friends, but now it's the end of our love song


so let's leave it alone, 'cause we can't see eye to eye
there ain't no good guy, there ain't no bad guy
there's only you and me and we just disagree
ooh-hoo-hoo, oh-oh-ho


so let's leave it alone, 'cause we can't see eye to eye
there ain't no good guy, there ain't no bad guy
there's only you and me and we just disagree
ooh-hoo-hoo, oh, oh-oh-ho
