went to see the gypsy
staying in a big hotel
he smiled when he saw me coming
and he said, “well, well, well”
his room was dark and crowded
lights were low and dim
“how are you?” he said to me
i said it back to him


i went down to the lobby
to make a small call out
a pretty dancing girl was there
and she began to shout
“go on back to see the gypsy
he can move you from the rear
drive you from your fear
bring you through the mirror
he did it in las vegas
and he can do it here”


oh the lights were on the river
shining from outside
i contemplated every move
or at least i tried


i went back to see the gypsy
it was nearly early dawn
the gypsy’s door was open wide
but the gypsy was gone
and that pretty dancing girl
she could not be found
so i watched that sun come rising
from that little minnesota town
