you have given everything to me
what can i do for you?
you have given me eyes to see
what can i do for you?


pulled me out of bondage and you made me renewed inside
filled up a hunger that had always been denied
opened up a door no man can shut and you opened it up so wide
and you’ve chosen me to be among the few
what can i do for you?


you have laid down your life for me
what can i do for you?
you have explained every mystery
what can i do for you?


soon as a man is born, you know the sparks begin to fly
he gets wise in his own eyes and he’s made to believe a lie
who would deliver him from the death he’s bound to die?
well, you’ve done it all and there’s no more anyone can pretend to do
what can i do for you?


you have given all there is to give
what can i do for you?
you have given me life to live
how can i live for you?


i know all about poison, i know all about fiery darts
i don’t care how rough the road is, show me where it starts
whatever pleases you, tell it to my heart
well, i don’t deserve it but i sure did make it through
what can i do for you?
