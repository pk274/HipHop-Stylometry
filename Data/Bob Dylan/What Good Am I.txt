what good am i if i’m like all the rest
if i just turn away, when i see how you’re dressed
if i shut myself off so i can’t hear you cry
what good am i?


what good am i if i know and don’t do
if i see and don’t say, if i look right through you
if i turn a deaf ear to the thundering sky
what good am i?


what good am i while you softly weep
and i hear in my head what you say in your sleep
and i freeze in the moment like the rest who don’t try
what good am i?


what good am i then to others and me
if i’ve had every chance and yet still fail to see
if my hands are tied must i not wonder within
who tied them and why and where must i have been?


what good am i if i say foolish things
and i laugh in the face of what sorrow brings
and i just turn my back while you silently die
what good am i?
