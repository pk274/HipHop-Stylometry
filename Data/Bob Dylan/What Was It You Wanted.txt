what was it you wanted?
tell me again so i’ll know
what’s happening in there
what’s going on in your show
what was it you wanted
could you say it again?
i’ll be back in a minute
you can get it together by then


what was it you wanted
you can tell me, i’m back
we can start it all over
get it back on the track
you got my attention
go ahead, speak
what was it you wanted
when you were kissing my cheek?


was there somebody looking
when you give me that kiss
someone there in the shadows
someone that i might have missed?
is there something you needed
something i don’t understand
what was it you wanted
do i have it here in my hand?


whatever you wanted
slipped out of my mind
would you remind me again
if you’d be so kind
has the record been breaking
did the needle just skip
is there somebody waiting
was there a slip of the lip?


what was it you wanted
i ain’t keeping score
are you the same person
that was here before?
is it something important?
maybe not
what was it you wanted?
tell me again i forgot


whatever you wanted
what could it be
did somebody tell you
that you could get it from me
is it something that comes natural
is it easy to say
why do you want it
who are you anyway?


is the scenery changing
am i getting it wrong
is the whole thing going backwards
are they playing our song?
where were you when it started
do you want it for free
what was it you wanted
are you talking to me?
