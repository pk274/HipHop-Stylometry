oh, the streets of rome are filled with rubble
ancient footprints are everywhere
you can almost think that you're seeing double
on a cold, dark night by the spanish stairs
got to hurry on back to my hotel room
gonna wash my clothes, scrape off all the grease
better lock the doors and turn my back on the world for a while
now stay right there 'til i paint my masterpiece


well, the hours i've spent inside the colosseum
dodging lions with a need and a hungry look
those mighty kings of the jungle, i could hardly stand to see them
i could see 'em comin', i could rеad their faces like a book
train wheels running through thе back of my memory
when i ran on the hilltop following a pack of wild geese
someday, everything is going to be different
when i paint, paint my masterpiece


sailing 'round the world full of crimson and clover
sometime i feel just like my cup is running over


i left rome and pulled into brussels
on a plane ride so bumpy that it made me ill
clergymen in uniform and young girls pulling mussels
everyone was there to meet me coming down the hill
newspapermen eating candy
had to be held back by big police
someday, everything is going to be beautiful
when i paint my masterpiece
