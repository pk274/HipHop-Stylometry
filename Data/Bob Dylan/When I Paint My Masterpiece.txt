oh, the streets of rome are filled with rubble
ancient footprints are everywhere
you can almost think that you’re seeing double
on a cold, dark night on the spanish stairs
got to hurry on back to my hotel room
where i’ve got me a date with botticelli’s niece
she promised that she’d be right there with me
when i paint my masterpiece


oh, the hours i’ve spent inside the colosseum
dodging lions and wasting time
oh, those mighty kings of the jungle, i could hardly stand to see them
yes, it sure has been a long, hard climb
train wheels running through the back of my memory
when i ran on the hilltop following a pack of wild geese
someday, everything is going to be smooth like a rhapsody
when i paint my masterpiece


sailing 'round the world in a dirty gondola
oh, to be back in the land of coca-cola


well, i left rome and landed in brussels
on a plane ride so bumpy that i almost cried
clergymen in uniform and young girls pulling mussels
everyone was there to greet me when i stepped inside
newspapermen eating candy
had to be held down by big police
someday, everything is going to be different
when i paint my masterpiece
