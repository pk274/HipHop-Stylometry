god don’t make promises that he don’t keep
you got some big dreams, baby, but in order to dream you gotta still be asleep


when you gonna wake up, when you gonna wake up
when you gonna wake up — strengthen the things that remain?


counterfeit philosophies have polluted all of your thoughts
karl marx has got you by the throat and henry kissinger’s got you tied up in knots


when you gonna wake up, when you gonna wake up
when you gonna wake up — strengthen the things that remain?


you got innocent men in jail, your insane asylums are filled
you got unrighteous doctors dealing drugs that’ll never cure your ills


when you gonna wake up, when you gonna wake up
when you gonna wake up — strengthen the things that remain?


you got men who can’t hold their peace and women who can’t control their tongues
the rich seduce the poor and the old are seduced by the young


when you gonna wake up, when you gonna wake up
when you gonna wake up — strengthen the things that remain?


adulterers in churches and pornography in the schools
you got gangsters in power and lawbreakers making rules


when you gonna wake up, when you gonna wake up
when you gonna wake up and strengthen the things that remain?


spiritual advisors and gurus to guide your every move
instant inner peace and every step you take has got to be approved


when you gonna wake up, said when you gonna wake up
when you gonna wake up — strengthen the things that remain?


do you ever wonder just what god requires?
you think he’s just an errand boy to satisfy your wandering desires


when you gonna wake up, when you gonna wake up
when you gonna wake up and strengthen the things that remain?


you can’t take it with you and you know that it’s too worthless to be sold
they tell you, “time is money,” as if your life was worth its weight in gold


there’s a man up on a cross and he’s been crucified for you
believe in his power, it's all about you got to do


when you gonna wake up, when you gonna wake up
when you gonna wake up — strengthen the things that remain?
