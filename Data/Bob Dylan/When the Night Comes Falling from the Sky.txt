look out across the fields, see me returning
smoke is in your eye, you draw a smile
from the fireplace where my letters to you are burning
you’ve had time to think about it for a while


well, i’ve walked two hundred miles, now look me over
it’s the end of the chase and the moon is high
it won’t matter who loves who
you’ll love me or i’ll love you
when the night comes falling
when the night comes falling
when the night comes falling from the sky


i can see through your walls and i know you’re hurting
sorrow covers you up like a cape
only yesterday i know that you’ve been flirting
with disaster you somehow managed to escape


well, i can’t provide for you no easy answers
who are you that i should have to lie?
you’ll know all about it, love
it’ll fit you like a glove
when the night comes falling
when the night comes falling
when the night comes falling from the sky


i can hear your trembling heart beat like a river
you must have been protecting someone last time i called
i’ve never asked you for nothing that you couldn’t deliver
i’ve never asked you to set yourself up for a fall


i saw thousands who could have overcome the darkness
for the love of a lousy buck, i’ve watched them die
stick around, baby, we’re not through
don’t look for me, i’ll see you
when the night comes falling
when the night comes falling
when the night comes falling from the sky


in your teardrops, i can see my own reflection
it was on the northern border of texas where i crossed the line
i don’t want to be a fool starving for affection
i don’t want to drown in someone else’s wine


for all eternity i think i will remember
that icy wind that’s howling in your eye
you will seek me and you’ll find me
in the wasteland of your mind
when the night comes falling
when the night comes falling
when the night comes falling from the sky


well, i sent you my feelings in a letter
but you were gambling for support
this time tomorrow i’ll know you better
when my memory is not so short


this time i’m asking for freedom
freedom from a world which you deny
and you’ll give it to me now
i’ll take it anyhow
when the night comes falling
when the night comes falling
when the night comes falling from the sky
