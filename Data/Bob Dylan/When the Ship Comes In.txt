oh, the time will come up
when the winds will stop
and the breeze will cease to be breathin'
like the stillness in the wind
before the hurricane begins
the hour that the ship comes in


and the sea will split
and the ships will hit
and the sands on the shoreline will be shaking
then the tide will sound
and the waves will pound
and the mornin' will be a-breakin'


the fishes will laugh
as they swim out of the path
and the seagulls, they'll be smilin'
and the rocks on the sand
will proudly stand
the hour that the ship comes in


and the words that are used
for to get the ship confused
will not be understood as they're spoken
for the chains of the sea
will have busted in the night
and be buried on the bottom of the ocean


a song will lift as the mainsail shifts
and the boat drifts onto the shoreline
and the sun will respect
every face on the deck
the hour that the ship comes in


and the sands will roll out a carpet of gold
for your weary toes to be a-touchin'
and the ship's wise men
will remind you once again
that the whole wide world is watchin'


oh, the foes will rise
with the sleep still in their eyes
and they'll jerk from their beds and think they're dreamin'
but they'll pinch themselves and squeal
and they'll know that it's for real
the hour that the ship comes in


and they'll raise their hands
sayin', "we'll meet all your demands"
but we'll shout from the bow, "your days are numbered"
and like pharoah's tribe
they'll be drowned in the tide
and like goliath, they'll be conquered
