there’s a long-distance train rolling through the rain
tears on the letter i write
there’s a woman i long to touch and i miss her so much
but she’s drifting like a satellite


there’s a neon light ablaze in a green smoky haze
laughter down on elizabeth street
and a lonesome bell tone in that valley of stone
where she bathed in a stream of pure heat


her father would emphasize you got to be more than streetwise
but he practiced what he preached from the heart
a full-blooded cherokee, he predicted it to me
the time and the place that we'd part


there’s a babe in the arms of a woman in a rage
and a longtime golden-haired stripper onstage
and she winds back the clock and she turns back the page
of a book that nobody can write
oh, where are you tonight?


the truth was obscure, too profound and too pure
to live it you had to explode
in that last hour of need, we entirely agreed
sacrifice was the code of the road


i left town at dawn, with marcel and st. john
strong men belittled by doubt
i couldn’t tell her what my private thoughts were
but she had some way of finding them out


he took dead-center aim but he missed just the same
she was waiting, putting flowers on the shelf
she could feel my despair as i climbed up her hair
and discovered her invisible self


there’s a lion in the road, there’s a demon escaped
there’s a million dreams gone, there’s a landscape being raped
as her beauty fades and i watch her undrape
i won’t but then again, maybe i might
oh, if i could just find you tonight


i fought with my twin, that enemy within
’til both of us fell by the way
horseplay and disease is killing me by degrees
while the law looks the other way


your partners in crime hit me up for nickels and dimes
the man you were lovin’ could never get clean
it felt out of place, my foot in his face
but he should-a stayed where his money was green


i bit into the root of forbidden fruit
with the juice running down my leg
then i dealt with your boss, who’d never known about loss
who always was too proud to beg


there’s a white diamond gloom on the dark side of this room
and a pathway that leads up to the stars
if you don’t believe there’s a price for this sweet paradise
just remind me to show you the scars


there’s a new day at dawn and i’ve finally arrived
if i’m there in the morning, baby, you’ll know i’ve survived
i can’t believe it, i can’t believe i’m alive
but without you it just doesn’t seem right
oh, where are you tonight?
