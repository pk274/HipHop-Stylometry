far away where the soft winds blow
far away from it all
there is a place you go
where teardrops fall


far away in the stormy night
far away and over the wall
you are there in the flickering light
where teardrops fall


we banged the drum slowly
and played the fife lowly
you know the song in my heart
in the turning of twilight
in the shadows of moonlight
you can show me a new place to start


i’ve torn my clothes and i’ve drained the cup
stripping away at it all
thinking of you when the sun comes up
where teardrops fall


by rivers of blindness
in love and with kindness
we could hold up a toast if we meet
to the cutting of fences
to sharpen the senses
that linger in the fireball heat


roses are red, violets are blue
and time is beginning to crawl
i just might have to come see you
where teardrops fall
