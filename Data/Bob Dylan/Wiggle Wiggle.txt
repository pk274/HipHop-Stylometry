wiggle, wiggle, wiggle like a gypsy queen
wiggle, wiggle, wiggle all dressed in green
wiggle, wiggle, wiggle 'til the moon is blue
wiggle 'til the moon sees you


wiggle, wiggle, wiggle in your boots and shoes
wiggle, wiggle, wiggle, you got nothing to lose
wiggle, wiggle, wiggle like a swarm of bees
wiggle on your hands and knees


wiggle to the front, wiggle to the rear
wiggle 'til you wiggle right out of here
wiggle 'til it opens, wiggle 'til it shuts
wiggle 'til it bites, wiggle 'til it cuts


wiggle, wiggle, wiggle like a bowl of soup
wiggle, wiggle, wiggle like a rolling hoop
wiggle, wiggle, wiggle like a ton of lead
wiggle, you can raise the dead


wiggle 'til you're high, wiggle 'til you're higher
wiggle 'til you vomit fire
wiggle 'til it whispers, wiggle 'til it hums
wiggle 'til it answers, wiggle 'til it comes


wiggle, wiggle, wiggle like satin and silk
wiggle, wiggle, wiggle like a pail of milk
wiggle, wiggle, wiggle, rattle and shake
wiggle like a big fat snake
