(winter wonderland)
(wonderland)


sleigh bells ring, are you listening?
in the lane, snow is glistening
a beautiful sight, we're happy tonight
walking in a winter wonderland


gone away is a bluebird
in his place is a new bird
he sings a love song as we go along
walking in a winter wonderland


in the meadow we can build a snowman
and pretend that he is parson brown
he'll say, "are you married?" we'll say, "no, man"
but you can do the job when you're in town


later on, we'll conspire
as we dream by the fire
to face unafraid the plans that we've made
walking in a winter wonderland


in the meadow we can build a snowman
and pretend that he's a circus clown
we'll have lots of fun with mister snowman
until the other kids all knock him down


when it snows, ain't it thrillin'
though your nose gets a chillin'
we'll frolic and play, the eskimo way
walking in a winter wonderland
(ooh)
