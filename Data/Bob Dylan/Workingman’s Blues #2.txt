there's an evening' haze settlin' over the town
starlight by the edge of the creek
the buyin' power of the proletariat's gone down
money's gettin' shallow and weak
the place i love best is a sweet memory
it's a new path that we trod
they say low wages are a reality
if we want to compete abroad


my cruel weapons have been put on the shelf
come sit down on my knee
you are dearer to me than myself
as you yourself can see
i'm listening' to the steel rails hum
got both eyes tight shut
just sitting here trying to keep the hunger from
creeping it's way into my gut


meet me at the bottom, don't lag behind
bring me my boots and shoes
you can hang back or fight your best on the front line
sing a little bit of these workingman's blues


now, i'm sailing' on back, ready for the long haul
tossed by the winds and the seas
i'll drag them all down to hell and i'll stand them at the wall
i'll sell them to their enemies
i'm trying' to feed my soul with thought
gonna sleep off the rest of the day
sometimes no one wants what we got
sometimes you can't give it away


now the place is ringed with countless foes
some of them may be deaf and dumb
no man, no woman knows
the hour that sorrow will come
in the dark i hear the night birds call
i can hear a lover's breath
i sleep in the kitchen with my feet in the hall
sleep is like a temporary death


meet me at the bottom, don't lag behind
bring me my boots and shoes
you can hang back or fight your best on the front line
sing a little bit of these workingman's blues


well, they burned my barn, they stole my horse
i can't save a dime
i got to be careful, i don't want to be forced
into a life of continual crime
i can see for myself that the sun is sinking
how i wish you were here to see
tell me now, am i wrong in thinking
that you have forgotten me?


now they worry and they hurry and they fuss and they fret
they waste your nights and days
them i will forget
but you i'll remember always
old memories of you to me have clung
you've wounded me with words
gonna have to straighten out your tongue
it's all true, everything you have heard


meet me at the bottom, don't lag behind
bring me my boots and shoes
you can hang back or fight your best on the front line
sing a little bit of these workingman's blues


in you, my friend, i find no blame
wanna look in my eyes, please do
no one can ever claim
that i took up arms against you
all across the peaceful sacred fields
they will lay you low
they'll break your horns and slash you with steel
i say it so it must be so


now i'm down on my luck and i'm black and blue
gonna give you another chance
i'm all alone and i'm expecting you
to lead me off in a cheerful dance
got a brand new suit and a brand new wife
i can live on rice and beans
some people never worked a day in their life
don't know what work even means


meet me at the bottom, don't lag behind
bring me my boots and shoes
you can hang back or fight your best on the front line
sing a little bit of these workingman's blues
