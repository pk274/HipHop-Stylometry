strange things have happened, like never before
my baby told me i would have to go
i can't be good no more, once like i did before
i can't be good, baby
honey, because the world gone wrong


feel bad this morning, ain't got no home
no use in worrying 'cause the world gone wrong
i can't be good no more, once like i did before
i can't be good, baby
honey, because the world gone wrong


i told you, baby, right to your head
if i didn't leave you i would have to kill you dead
i can't be good no more, once like i did before
i can't be good, baby
honey, 'cause the world gone wrong


i tried to be loving and treat you kind
but it seems like you're never right, you got no loyal mind
i can't be good no more, once like i did before
i can't be good, baby
honey, 'cause the world's gone wrong


if you have a woman and she don't treat you kind
praise the good lord to get her out of your mind
i can't be good no more, once like i did before
i can't be good, baby
honey, because the world gone wrong


said, when you been good now, can't do no more
just tell her kindly, "there is the front door."
i can't be good no more, once like i did before
i can't be good, baby
honey, because the world's gone wrong


pack up my suitcase, give me my hat
no use to ask me, baby, 'cause i'll never be back
i can't be good no more, once like i did before
i can't be good, baby
honey, because the world gone wrong
