you harbor resentment
you know there ain’t too much of a thrill
you wish for contentment
but you got an emptiness that can’t be filled
you’ve had enough of hatred
your bones are breaking, can’t find nothing sacred


ye shall be changed, ye shall be changed
in a twinkling of an eye, when the last trumpet blows
the dead will arise and burst out of your clothes
and ye shall be changed


everything you’ve gotten
you’ve gotten by sweat, blood and muscle
from early in the morning ’till way past dark
all you ever do is hustle
all your loved ones have walked out the door
you’re not even sure ’bout your wife and kids no more, but




the past don’t control you
but the future’s like a roulette wheel spinning
deep down inside
you know you need a whole new beginning
don’t have to go to russia or iran
just surrender to god and he’ll move you right here where you stand, and




you drink bitter water
and you been eating the bread of sorrow
you can’t live for today
when all you’re ever thinking of is tomorrow
the path you’ve endured has been rough
when you’ve decided that you’ve had enough, then
