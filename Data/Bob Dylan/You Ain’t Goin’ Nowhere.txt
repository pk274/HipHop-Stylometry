clouds so swift, the rain falling in
gonna see a movie called gunga din
pack up your money, pull up your tent, mcguinn
you ain't goin' nowhere


ooh-wee, ride me high
tomorrow's the day that my bride's a-gonna come
ooh-wee, are we gonna fly
down into the easy chair


genghis khan and his brother don
couldn't keep on keeping on
we'll climb that bridge after it's gone
after we're way past it


ooh-wee, ride me high
tomorrow's the day that my bride's a-gonna come
ooh-wee, are we gonna fly
down into the easy chair


buy me some rings and a gun that sings
a flute that toots and a bee that stings
the sky that cries and a bird that flies
a fish that walks and a dog that talks


ooh-wee, ride me high
tomorrow's the day that my bride's a-gonna come
ooh-wee, are we gonna fly
down into the easy chair

ooh-wee, ride me high
tomorrow's the day that my bride's a-gonna come
ooh-wee, are we gonna fly
down into the easy chair
