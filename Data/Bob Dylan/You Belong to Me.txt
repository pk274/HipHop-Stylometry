see the pyramids along the nile
watch the sun rise from a tropic isle
just remember, darling, all the while
you belong to me


see the market place in old algiers
send me photographs and souvenirs
just remember when a dream appears
you belong to me


i'll be so alone without you
maybe you'll be lonesome too
and blue


fly the ocean in a silver plane
see the jungle when it's wet with rain
just remember 'til you're home again
you belong to me


i'll be so alone without you
maybe you'll be lonesome too
and blue


fly the ocean in a silver plane
see the jungle when it's wet with rain
just remember 'til you're home again
you belong to me
