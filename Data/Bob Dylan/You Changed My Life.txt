i was listening to the voices of death on parade
singing about conspiracy, wanted me to be afraid
working for a system i couldn't understand or trust
suffered ridicule and wanting to give it all up in disgust


but you changed my life
came along in a time of strife
in hunger and need, you made my heart bleed
you changed my life


talk about salvation, people suddenly get tired
they got a million things to do, they're all so inspired
you do the work of the devil, you got a million friends
they'll be there when you got something, they'll take it all in the end


but you changed my life
came along in a time of strife
in hunger and need, you made my heart bleed
you changed my life


well, the nature of man is to beg and to steal
i do it myself, it's not so unreal
the call of the wild is forever at my door
wants me to fly like an eagle while being chained to the floor


but you changed my life
came along in a time of strife
in hunger and need, you made my heart bleed
you changed my life


i was eating with the pigs off a fancy tray
i was told i was looking good and to have a nice day
it all seemed so proper, it all seemed so elite
eating that absolute garbage while being so discreet


but you changed my life
came along in a time of strife
in hunger and need, you made my heart bleed
you changed my life


you were glowing in the sun while being peaceably calm
while orphans of man danced to the beat of the palm
your eyes were on fire, your feet were of brass
in the world you had made they made you an outcast


but you changed my life
came along in a time of strife
in hunger and need, you made my heart bleed
you changed my life


there was someone in my body that i could hardly see
invading my privacy making my decisions for me
holding me back, not letting me stand
making me feel like a stranger in a strange land


but you changed my life
came along in a time of strife
in hunger and need, you made my heart bleed
you changed my life


my lord and my savior, my companion, my friend
heart fixer, mind regulator, true to the end
my creator, my comforter, my cause for joy
what the world is set against but will never destroy


but you changed my life
came along in a time of strife
in hunger and need, you made my heart bleed
you changed my life
