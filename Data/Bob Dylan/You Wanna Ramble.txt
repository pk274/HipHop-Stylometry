well i told my baby
i said "baby, i know
where you been
well, i know who you are
and what league you played in"
you wanna ramble
to the break of dawn
you wanna ramble
to the break of dawn
you wanna ramble
to the break of dawn


well, the night is so empty
so quiet and still
for only fifteen
hundred dollars
you can have anybody killed
you wanna ramble
to the break of dawn
you wanna ramble
to the break of dawn
you wanna ramble
to the break of dawn


well, i told my baby
further down the line
i said, "what happens tomorrow
is on your head, not mine"
you wanna ramble
to the break of dawn
you wanna ramble
to the break of dawn
you wanna ramble
to the break of dawn
