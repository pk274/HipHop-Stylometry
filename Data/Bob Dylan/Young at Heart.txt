fairy tales can come true
it can happen to you if you're young at heart
for it's hard, you will find
to be narrow of mind if you're young at heart


you can go to extremes with impossible schemes
you can laugh when your dreams fall apart at the seams
and life gets more exciting with each passing day
and love is either in your heart or on it's way


don't you know that it's worth
every treasure on earth to be young at heart?
for as rich as you are
it's much better by far to be young at heart


and if you should survive to a hundred and five
look at all you'll derive out of being alive
and here is the best part, you have a head start
if you are among the very young at heart


and if you should survive to a hundred and five
look at all you'll derive out of being alive
and here is the best part, you have a head start
if you are among the very young at heart
