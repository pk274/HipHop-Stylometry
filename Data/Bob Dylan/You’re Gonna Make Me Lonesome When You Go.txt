i’ve seen love go by my door
it’s never been this close before
never been so easy or so slow
i've been shooting in the dark too long
when something’s not right, it’s wrong
you're gonna make me lonesome when you go


dragon clouds so high above
i’ve only known careless love
it always just hit me from below
but this time 'round it’s more correct
right on target, so direct
you're gonna make me lonesome when you go


purple clover, queen anne's lace
crimson hair across your face
you could make me cry, if you don’t know
can’t remember what i was thinking of
you might be spoilin’ me too much love
you're gonna make me lonesome when you go


flowers on the hillside blooming crazy
crickets talking back and forth in rhyme
blue river running slow and lazy
i could stay with you forever and never realize the time


situations have ended sad
relationships have all been bad
mine’ve been like verlaine’s and rimbaud
but there’s no way i can compare
all them scenes to this affair
you're gonna make me lonesome when you go


you're gonna make me wonder what i’m doin’
staying far behind without you
you're gonna make me wonder what i’m sayin’
you're gonna make me give myself a good talking-to


i’ll look for you in old honolulu
san francisco or ashtabula
you're gonna have to leave me now, i know
but i’ll see you in the sky above
in the tall grass, in the ones i love
you're gonna make me lonesome when you go
