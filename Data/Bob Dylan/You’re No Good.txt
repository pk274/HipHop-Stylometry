well, i don't know why i love you like i do
nobody in the world can get along with you
you got the ways of a devil sleeping in a lion's den
i come home last night you wouldn't even let me in


oh sometimes you're as sweet as anybody want to be
oh when you get the crazy notion of jumping all over me
well, you give me the blues, i guess you're satisfied
when you give me the blues i want to lay down and die


i helped you when you had no shoes on your feet, pretty mama
i helped you when you had no food to eat
now you're the kind of woman that just don't understand
you're taking all my money and give it to another man


well, you're that kind of woman makes a man lose his brains
you're that kind of woman drives a man insane
well, you give me the blues, i guess you're satisfied
you give me the blues, i want to lay down and die
