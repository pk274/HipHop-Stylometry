our conversation was short and sweet
it nearly swept me off-a my feet
and i'm back in the rain, oh
and you are on dry land
oh, you made it there somehow
you're a big girl now


love is so simple, to quote a phrase
you've known it all the while, i'm learning it these days
oh, i know where i can find you, oh
in somebody's room
oh, it's a price i have to pay
you're a big girl all the way


bird on the horizon, sitting on a fence
he's singing his song for me at his own expense
and i'm just like that bird, oh
singing just for you
oh, i hope that you can hear
hear me singing through these tears


time is a jet plane, it moves too fast
oh, but what a shame it is that all we've shared can't last
i can change, i swear, oh
see what you can do, oh
i can make it through
you can make it too


a change in the weather can be extreme
but it ain't like changing horses in midstream?
i'm going out of my mind, oh
with a pain that stops and starts, oh
like a corkscrew to my heart
ever since we've been apart
