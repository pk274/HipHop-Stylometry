They see that low rider go by, they're like, "Oh my!"
You ain't got to tell me why you're sick 'cause I know why
I dip through in that Six-Trey like, "Sick 'em, Dre!"
I'm an itch that they can't scratch, they're sick of me
But hey, what else can I say? I love L.A.
'Cause over and above all, it's just another day
And this one begins where the last one ends
Pick up where we left off and get smashed again
I'll be damned, just fucked around and crashed my Benz
Drivin' 'round with a smashed front end, let's cash that one in
Grab another one from out the stable
The Monte Carlo, El Camino, or the El Dorado?
The hell if I know, do I want leather seats or vinyl?
Decisions, decisions, garage looks like Precision Collision
Or Maaco, beats quake like Waco
Just keep the bass low, speakers away from your face though


y'all know me, still the same og
but i been low-key
hated on by most these niggas
with no cheese, no deals and no g's
no wheels and no keys
no boats, no snowmobiles, and no skis
mad at me, 'cause i can finally afford to provide my family with groceries
got a crib with a studio and it's all full of tracks
to add to the wall full of plaques
hangin' up in the office and back at my house like trophies
did y'all think i'ma let my dough freeze? hoe, please
you better bow down on both knees
who you think taught you to smoke trees?
who you think brought you the oldies?
eazy-e's, ice cube's, and d.o.c.'s
the snoop d-o-double-g's
and the group that said, "motherfuck the police!"
gave you a tape full of dope beats
to bump when you stroll through in your hood
and when your album sales wasn't doin' too good
who's the doctor they told you to go see?
y'all better listen up closely
all you niggas that said that i turned pop or the firm flopped
y'all are the reason that dre ain't been gettin' no sleep
so fuck y'all, all of y'all!
if y'all don't like me, blow me!
y'all are gon' keep fuckin' around with me and turn me back to the old me


if it was up to me, you motherfuckers'd stop
comin' up to me with your hands out
lookin' up to me like you want somethin' free
when my last cd was out, you weren't bumpin' me
but now that i got this little company
everybody wanna come to me
like it was some disease, but you won't get a crumb from me
'cause i'm from the streets of c-compton! (compton!)
i told 'em all
all 'em little gangstas, who you think helped mold 'em all?
now you wanna run around talkin' 'bout guns like i ain't got none
what, you think i sold 'em all
'cause i stay well off?
now all i get is hate mail all day sayin' dre fell off
what, 'cause i been in the lab
with a pen and a pad tryin' to get this damn label off?
i ain't havin' that
this is the millennium of aftermath
it ain't gon' be nothin' after that
so give me one more platinum plaque
and fuck rap, you can have it back
so where's all the mad rappers at?
it's like a jungle in this habitat
but all you savage cats know that i was strapped with gats
while you were cuddlin' a cabbage patch


y'all know me, still the same og

back when cube was rollin' with lorenzo in a benzo
i was bangin' with a gang of instrumentals
got the pens and pencils, got down to business
but sometimes, the business end of this shit can turn your friends against you
but you was a real nigga, i could sense it in you
i still remember the window of the car that you went through
that's fucked up, but i'll never forget the shit we been through
and i'ma do whatever it takes to convince you
'cause you my nigga, doc, and eazy, i'm still wit' you
fuck the beef, nigga, i miss you, and that's just being real wit' you
you see, the truth is, everybody wanna know how close me and snoop is
and who i'm still cool with
then, i got these fake-ass niggas i first blew with
claimin' they nonviolent, talkin' like they— (do not resist the beat)
spit venom in interviews, speakin' on reunions
move units, then talk shit, and we can do this
until then, i ain't even speakin' your name
just keep my name out of your mouth, and we can keep it the same, nigga
it ain't that i'm too big to listen to the rumors
it's just that i'm too damn big to pay attention to 'em
that's the difference


a'ight, hold up, hold up!
stop the beat a minute! i got somethin' to say, dre
i wanna tell you this shit right now while this fuckin' weed is in me (what the fuck?)
i don't know if i ever told you this
but i love you, dog, i got your motherfuckin' back (right), just know this shit
slim, i don't know if you noticed it
but i've had your back from day one, nigga, let's blow this bitch
i mean it, dog—you ever need somebody offed: "whose throat is it?"
well, if you ever kill that kim bitch, i'll show you where the ocean is
well, that's cool, and i appreciate the offer
but if i do decide to really murder my daughter's mama
i'ma sit her up in the front seat and put sunglasses on her
and cruise around with her for seven hours through california
and have her wavin' at people (hi!)
then drop her off on the corner at the police station
and drive off, honkin' the horn for her (*beep-beep!*)
raw-dog, get your arm gnawed off
drop the sawed-off and beat you with the piece it was sawed off of
fuck blood, i wanna see some lungs coughed up
get shot up in the hot tub 'til the bubbles pop up
in they nose and cough snot up, mucus and hot water
that's for tryna talk like the chronic was lost product
that's for even thinkin' of havin' them thoughts thought up
and you better show some respect whenever the doc's brought up
so what's the difference between us? we can start at the penis
or we can scream, "i just don't give a fuck!" and see who means it
