murder this, murder listen, hear that suburban whippin'?
tinted windows, right at your wifey (brrrat!)
and i bet you miss her
reload the pro tools and we throw the clip in both trays
that's one on the left and one in the right hand
scottie pippen, both ways
been doin' drive-bys
got this music industry timeline lookin' like rosecrans
when these niggas throw up them signs high
i'm talking about that bottom, where it's high crimes
shit, i’m just tryna get paid and keep them thighs high (thighs high)
sometimes, i feel like i could just bury ‘em, bury 'em
cause delirium, mass hysteria, no scarier area
i'm very aware hip-hop needed something to carry it
so i married that bitch and swung down in that chariot
and you way too fuckin' close, beware the barrier
this is hub city, nigga, don't make us embarrass you
man, you should be realistic, these niggas 'round here ballistic
we did the numbers, and you looking like another statistic
