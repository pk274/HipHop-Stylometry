back when cube was rollin' with lorenzo in a benzo
i was bangin' with a gang of instrumentals
got the pens and pencils, got down to business
but sometimes, the business end of this shit can turn your friends against you
but you was a real nigga, i could sense it in you
i still remember the window of the car that you went through
that's fucked up, but i'll never forget the shit we been through
and i'ma do whatever it takes to convince you
'cause you my nigga, doc, and eazy, i'm still wit' you
fuck the beef, nigga, i miss you, and that's just being real wit' you
you see, the truth is, everybody wanna know how close me and snoop is
and who i'm still cool with
then, i got these fake-ass niggas i first blew with
claimin' they nonviolent, talkin' like they— (do not resist the beat)
spit venom in interviews, speakin' on reunions
move units, then talk shit, and we can do this
until then, i ain't even speakin' your name
just keep my name out of your mouth, and we can keep it the same, nigga
it ain't that i'm too big to listen to the rumors
it's just that i'm too damn big to pay attention to 'em
that's the difference


a'ight, hold up, hold up!
stop the beat a minute! i got somethin' to say, dre
i wanna tell you this shit right now while this fuckin' weed is in me (what the fuck?)
i don't know if i ever told you this
but i love you, dog, i got your motherfuckin' back (right), just know this shit
slim, i don't know if you noticed it
but i've had your back from day one, nigga, let's blow this bitch
i mean it, dog—you ever need somebody offed: "whose throat is it?"
well, if you ever kill that kim bitch, i'll show you where the ocean is
well, that's cool, and i appreciate the offer
but if i do decide to really murder my daughter's mama
i'ma sit her up in the front seat and put sunglasses on her
and cruise around with her for seven hours through california
and have her wavin' at people (hi!)
then drop her off on the corner at the police station
and drive off, honkin' the horn for her (*beep-beep!*)
raw-dog, get your arm gnawed off
drop the sawed-off and beat you with the piece it was sawed off of
fuck blood, i wanna see some lungs coughed up
get shot up in the hot tub 'til the bubbles pop up
in they nose and cough snot up, mucus and hot water
that's for tryna talk like the chronic was lost product
that's for even thinkin' of havin' them thoughts thought up
and you better show some respect whenever the doc's brought up
so what's the difference between us? we can start at the penis
or we can scream, "i just don't give a fuck!" and see who means it
