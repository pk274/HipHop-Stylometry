runnin' with my brothers, headed for the homebase
with a steady pace on the face that just we raced
the road ahead goes on and on
it even seems like its gettin' longer than a marathon
runnin' on but never runnin' out
stayin' wired and if i get tired, i can still try out
hitchhikin' if that's what it gotta do
but nobody's pickin' up a brother witta attitude
confused, yo but dre's never had nothin' to lose
one of the few who's been accused and abused
of the crime of poisonin' young minds
but you don't know nothin' til you been in my shoes
and dre is back from the c-p-t
droppin' some tracks that's d-o-p-e
so laid upon the p-o-l-i-c-e!
and anybody else that disagrees
stuck and runnin' hard, moving fast
'cause i been a brother known for havin' a notorious past
my mind was slick - my temper was too quick
now the fbi's all over my stick


clouds are dark and brothers are hidin'
and it's funny 'cause all these stupid suckers are riding
we started with five and, yo, one couldn't take it
so now there's four 'cause the fifth couldn't make it
the number's even - now i'm leavin'
we're never gettin' took by a woman with a weave in
her and the troops are right behind me
but they're so stupid, they'll never find me
