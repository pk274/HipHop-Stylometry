i got a taste for waste and a taste and a blood
murder i heard her when she screamed the "drop!"
'cause her son caught the slug
relate this to no choice
and listen to this straight-up man before they ban the voice
while i rhyme to the rhythm of a pop
remember the first nigga that runs is the first to get shot
whoever said that what i say and portray is negativity
need to come kick it in the city with me
and find the black and crack de fact
and take that shit back
'cause they don't wanna fuck with that
there's too many niggas they're tryin' to calm
if mothafuckaz could get it, nobody would've fuck with it
appetite for destruction
for him to get a bit more shit he gotta commit
murder in the first degree and manslaughter
takin' the life of his wife and young daughter
a whole city of bitches that look sucked up
and the niggas is killin', it's straight fucked up
whoever sayin' what i'm sayin is for greed
then i ain't even what they're tryin' to feed
my appetite for destruction

"you guys know who i'm talkin' to"
