(fuck is up?)
man, life's a bitch
you gotta put your pistol to the sky
kill a million motherfuckers and get high in order to be cool
man, you'se a motherfucking fool (speak to these niggas)
i thought the same way back in the days
young with a lack on daily things
never thought too much, homie, never trip
i got drunk as fuck, the homies blaze sticks
look out for them niggas out to get you
it's a mistake forgetting to take your pistol with you (your pistol, nigga)
niggas get swallowed in the game
i cock and bust hollows to peer, duck and frame
yo nigga, that shit sounds like i did it
don't blaze the indica without the thai with it
niggas look like they're doped up like tired bitches
with the eyes wide gone, you spit the harpoon
wiping shit the fuck out, like typhoons
with the little homeboys, t-bone and cartoons (c'mon)
motherfucker don't ask me for shit
fuck everything you believe in, little bitch
