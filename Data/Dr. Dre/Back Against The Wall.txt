guess who's back motherfucker i’m back (yeah)
guess who's back motherfucker i’m back
yeah listen
now i’ma do this like my life depending on it
my kids and my wife depending on it
everything in life i wanted, i own it
i can kick my feet up and relax if i wanted it to
but i’m back in the lab, making my next murder move
giving a murderer something to go and murder to
so they can celebrate when they're making the breaking news
niggas hate when you’re elevating, you're making moves
a lots changed, the same game with different rules
make a nigga cold hearted, niggas they got it lost it
niggas better be conscious, nigga better be softly
we ain’t taking no losses, bigger deals means bigger office
the blue steel will keep them niggas off us
i blew the trial because i hung the jury
shit, look what them streets done done to me
