yeah, what up, detroit?
nu-uh, nu-uh nuh, no, he didn't (ah)
they didn't do it again (what-what, you what?)
you shitted on these niggas two times, dr. dre?
oh, fo' sho'
uh-uh, naw, you smell that?
this is special right here (what-what, what-what-what?)
yeah, it's a toast to the boogie, baby, uh
to the boogie-oogie-oogie (aw, yeah)
ya know, what's crackin', dre?


just let me lay back and kick some old simplistic pimp shit on slim's shit
and start riots like limp bizkit (limp bizkit!)
throw on "guilty conscience" at concerts
and watch mosh pits 'til motherfuckers knock each other unconscious (watch out, nigga!)
some of these crowds that slim draws
is rowdy as crenshaw boulevard when it's packed and full of cars
some of these crowds me and snoop draw is niggas from crenshaw
from long beach to south central
whoa! not these niggas again
these grown-ass ignorant men with hair-triggers again (shit!)
you and what army could harm me?
d.r.e. and shady with doggy from long beach (westside)
came a long way to makin' these songs play
it'll be a wrong move to stare at me the wrong way
i got a long uz' and i carry it all day
sometimes it's like a nightmare just bein' andre
but iâ€¦
