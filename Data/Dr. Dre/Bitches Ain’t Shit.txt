i used to know a bitch named eric wright
we used to roll around and fuck the hoes at night
tighter than a motherfucker with the gangster beats
and we was ballin' on the motherfuckin' compton streets, peep
the shit got deep and it was on
number one song after number one song
long as my motherfuckin' pockets was fat
i didn't give a fuck where the bitch was at
but she was hangin' with a white bitch, doin' the shit she do
suckin' on his dick just to get a buck or two
and the few ends she got didn't mean nothin'
now she's suin' 'cause shit that she be doin' ain't shit
bitch can't hang with the streets, she found herself short
so now she takin' me to court
it's real conversation for your ass
so recognize and pass to daz
