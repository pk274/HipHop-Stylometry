ay, dre what's happening wit' it, my nigga?
still i'm at it, peel the plastic off it, you can feel the magic
still i'm laughing at the critics talking, i can see 'em gagging
when i'm back in the back of my city, back in the 'bach
with a batch of them banging dre beats with me, look where i'm at
it's the murder cap' and i'm captain at birthing this gangsta rap
it's a wrap when i'm done and i come a long way from a hundred dollars a month
to a hundred mil' in a day, bitch i'm from


and that's a given
i pass the blunt then pass the torch of course that's my decision
i crash the porsche then you report that you see me in benzes
i must report that we import the narcotics you bought it
then talked about it when crack hit the speakers, the music business
i blow up every time we throw up a record
depending on what you expecting, i'm sure it's bigger than your religion
perfected by niggas that manifested music to live in


so tell that gangster throw his set high
roll it up in a blunt, i'ma take you on the next high
i did exactly what i wanted that's what made them checks fly
in my direction, you never questioned when i said i
would be a mogul before i visit 2pac and left-eye
eazy and aaliyah when i see you we gon' test drive
a lambo in heaven but for now i'm on the redeye
flying back to my city cuz i'll forever standby
