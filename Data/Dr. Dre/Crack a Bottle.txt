they see that low rider go by, they're like, "oh my!"
you ain't got to tell me why you're sick 'cause i know why
i dip through in that six-trey like, "sick 'em, dre!"
i'm an itch that they can't scratch, they're sick of me
but hey, what else can i say? i love l.a.
'cause over and above all, it's just another day
and this one begins where the last one ends
pick up where we left off and get smashed again
i'll be damned, just fucked around and crashed my benz
drivin' 'round with a smashed front end, let's cash that one in
grab another one from out the stable
the monte carlo, el camino, or the el dorado?
the hell if i know, do i want leather seats or vinyl?
decisions, decisions, garage looks like precision collision
or maaco, beats quake like waco
just keep the bass low, speakers away from your face though
