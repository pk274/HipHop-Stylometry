i’m in this mothafucker doing what i wanna
10 bottles, 10 bitches go with my persona
pull up in that enzo then i do donuts
i’m that cool, cashews, make 'em all go nuts
(baby got ass, i need me a shot of that
lil mama get gangsta for me, stuff it in your prada bag)
that's right, she's got something that i wanna see
that's right, so if she leave, she fucking with me
that's life, twerk something, work something, hurt something
she wanna check, check this shit out like a verse coming
they rip their neck and run their mouth when they heard something
dre dropped another one and fucked around and murdered something
club filled with dead bodies
if not then you a zombie, i'm not gonna feel sorry
you pass out from it, get drunk, get blunted
do what you wanna do, drug test on you
lotta money when i talk
big mills, big deals ‘bout a hundred in a vault
sit still, that real, lotta haters throw salt
they lost big game give a fuck how you feel
i fear she just might just pop that pill
and feel on me all night till the tip spill
tip scales with her waistline, sex with the bassline
she gon' fuck a snare drum one drink at a time
blow right, hoes fight over my name
i got my dough right, hustle running all in my veins
it’s forty days, forty nights if i’m making it rain
i reign supreme, a bottle and some bomb-ass weed then we good
