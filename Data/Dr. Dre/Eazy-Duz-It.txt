eazy, but you shouldâ€”
bitch, shut the fuck up! get the fuck out of here
yo, dre (what's up?), give me a funky ass bassline!


wait a minute, wait a minute, who does it
muthafuckin' eazy does it
(but how does he do it)
"eazy duz it, do it eazy, that's what i'm doing"
("stop!") (man, whatcha gonna do now?)
