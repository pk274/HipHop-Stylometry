still dogg pound nigga, never givin' a fuck (yes)
east coast, west coast together
(yeah) what, what, what
pete rock, doc dre up in this bitch


verbal seduction is what i do to precautions
i burn metal with elegant etiquette
you puppet niggas fuckin' with your pedal
the devil's advocate, acidic idiots
why face 'em and why bother 'em?
my bitches them other draggings
nigga, and i'm the father
student of mass-mayhem, destruction
kurupt, the putoline's punchin' production
nothing can stop me from gettin' sloppy
slap the draws of the bitch like a puck, and it's ice hockey
rambo motherfucker, ready to face rocky
i leave you penny-less, insidious instrumental record
bodies burnt, only way to (shoutout to my baby bro)

results may vary in different areas
but they know, cpt
around the world we put fear in 'em, we was scarring 'em
egyptians bury kings with their gold into afterlife
to make sure that they made it
i think them plaques and them plaques will carry us
and now them guns out, ready to confetti 'em
lucky i made it out, 'cause the police planted that paraphernalia
half a davis, no letter man

i keep a seddative seddative settlin' in
hip-hop's iv, clear

i'm glad we had the chance to reminisce one time
'cause i missed you so-
nobody's ours for the taking
i was right there from the making
can't we take it back to the basics?
all i know, is all i got, goin' all in
the fuck, why not? (it's all i wanna do)
born to win, and i'm still on top
and i'm still tryna get it activated
that's all i wanna do, oh-ho-ho

oh yeah, you soundin' real good on it
you are now listenin' to racella (hot!)

oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
