wait a minute, wait a minute, cut thisâ€”
man what you gon' do now?
what we gonna do right here is go way back
how far you goin' back? way back
as we go a little somethin' like this, hit it


here's a little gangsta, short in size
a t-shirt and levi's is his only disguise
built like a tank, yet hard to hit
ice cube and eazy-e cold rockin' it
