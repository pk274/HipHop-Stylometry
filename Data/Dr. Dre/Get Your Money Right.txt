see stop signs and red lights, i hear gunshots and street fights
ambulance sirens holler in the late night
it's murder, compton nigga, it don't stop
fuck the world, dre'll blow it up
if you down, throw it up, soak it up like a sponge, baby
i'm sweepin' up all the crumbs daily
it all add up, it's about to get fucked the fuck up
shut the fuck up or get fucked the fuck up
for real nigga, keep your eyes on your women nigga
pass the lemon, squeeze it in hennessey nigga
it's all with me, let the mob kiss you
affiliation is my job, forever i'm a paid man
a brave man, i sip the henny down to nothin'
what you know about the knock you got from doc huh?
it's nothin', it's all money and cream
gasoline so supreme it's third under the greens
