you ain't heard of me, you ain't listenin hard enough
started in compton serving from a ice cream truck
now ten years later whipping a custom navigator
stepping on your toes playa, scuffing up your alligators
i'm ghetto, like newport cigarettes, feel me
boom bap and slap that ass silly
this is for the fulltime students slash parttime strippers
and young niggas, clocking at least five figures
some of us pro athletes, some of us rap over fat beats
some of us hustle in the streets
twenty deep in club nikki's so you know we gots to mingle
trickin' off a pocket full of singles, huh
and it's all bueno, musical mafia like frank sinatra
pop a thirteen shot glock to make you go see the doctor
ain't nuttin nice
from hood to hood, love livin the lavish life
