ai aiyo bud'da is, uhh, hands-on in the house
well check it out, put some shit on for em
let's get it on, kick it
ha yeah, hell yeah
yeah that shit sounds dope
aiyo kim, what you got to say


yeah
no question, kick back, watch my dough pile rise
still an everyday brother with my eyes on the prize
take my time analysing every song that dies
flossin the fliest rides from hits you memorise
been doin this since days of n.w.a
took it to the next level when i use to dj
got family and fans from new york to l.a
they keep it real cos they know that dre come with bombay
g's up, ain't nuttin changed, yo freeze up!
when i come thru, player haters, women one-two
the dotted maxwell from only a minimum of set sales
clutch your tails for honeys waitin to exhale
keep writin til the next millenium
tape one hit when i serve these fiends, stuff mo' potent than bolivian
welcome to the aftermath
aiyo crystal, what you got to say?
