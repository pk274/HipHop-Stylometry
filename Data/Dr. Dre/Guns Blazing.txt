it's time to face the music
a stay of execution
no more distribution
(the fuck you doin'?)


you did this to me
i'm right back on my bullshit, right back out in these streets
just remember that you did this to yourself (yeah, you did it to yourself)
now you gotta suffer the consequences
back up to bat and swingin' for the fences (remember that)


let's make one thing clear, here, here, my dear
my resolute for this year
no pollution, fresh air
my solution, long hair with a fat ass, i'm deadass
mile high club 'til i jеt lag
rothstein flow, casino
and you're just like gingеr, we know
single negro, i don't need your (double standards and hypocrisy)
and that fake handholdin' on father's day
you a different motherfucker when you're not with me
been sleepin' with the enemy, mockery
it's like i'm john f. kennedy, shots at me
yes, i'm president of debauchery
none of that bullshit ever got to me
'cause your pillow brillo, ditto
breakin' this shit down little by little
i ain't got time for the fuckin' pom-poms
shoulda never let this dog out of that kennel
