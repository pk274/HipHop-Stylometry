this is when shit hits the fan like it just splattered on stan
this is the only moment that matters, your homie rolled in with mathers
now chaos erupts, em's in back, dre's in the front
so do what we say at once, this songâ€™s like a seance, it haunts
it makes them stay in a trance, no choice, they have to dance
it's like the playoffs, just making sure that we stay in the hunt
take a day off of what? man, you better lay off the blunts
you must be smoking something, you think i ain't smoking nothing, stay off my nuts
now hit the floor, baby, time to wipe away all the rust
shake all them cobwebs loose
loosen up with a little bit of grey goose
yeah, girl, shake that caboose
i don't wanna see you try to make no excuse
d.r.e is on the loose
a mongoose when it comes to the chronic use
you know, i can't stand to lose
me and my goons are like animals
we come through like a pack of wolves
and we came here to retract the roof
yeah, man, ain't that the truth?
girl, your man's back in the booth
definitely back up in this bitch
and this is when all hell breaks loose


yeah, so let us in 'fore we huff and puff and we blow
we ain't bluffing for nothing, we'll knock the stuffing out you
revenge is so sweet, move 'til you injure your feet
yeah, move it or lose it, freak, move to the beat
lose yourself indubitably
pass up on that little cute chick right there?
that'd be pretty damn stupid to me
born and raised in the c-p-t, yeah, los angeles, rules of the streets
them haters hatin' on me, but i refuse to lose any sleep
keep that deuce-deuce in the seat
dre fall off? that's news to me
