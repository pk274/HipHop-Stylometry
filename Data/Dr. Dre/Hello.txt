did i fall off? got you in your room
rippin' every "chronic" poster on your wall off
just 'cause i put away the sawed off
now i got you sittin' back with a smirk
listening with your arms crossed
questioning dre's credibility (what?)
wondering if it's still in me to produce hits
y'all be killin' me
as if i need to make mo', i got a mansion
and six cars that are paid fo', suck my dick! (hello)
we came a long way from not givin' a fuck
sellin' tapes out of a trunk to movin' this far up
now we got the whole world starstruck
made a million-plus and still don't give a motherfuck
motherfucker, i'm dre! i don't need your respect
i don't need to make another album, bitch, i don't gotta do shit
i do it because i want to, not to stay in the game
fuck the fame, i'm still stayin' the same, lil' bitch! (hello)
