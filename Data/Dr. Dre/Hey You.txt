when the balls in my court, i stall til the last kick
brought up and trained to go platinum over plastic
fruits and fiber stored in my aftermath basket
(hey)
i took a break to see which niggas was fake
who was loyal, who was fake, what type of moves would they make
i stayed patient, taking my time like rehabilitation
good thing i had a strong foundation
