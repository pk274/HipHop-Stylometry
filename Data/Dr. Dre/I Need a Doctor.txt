it literally feels like a lifetime ago
but i still remember the shit like it was just yesterday, though
you walked in, yellow jump suit, whole room, cracked jokes
once you got inside the booth, told you, mic smoke
went through friends, some of them i put on, but they just left
they said they was ridin' to the death
but where the fuck are they now, now that i need them?
i don't see none of them, all i see is slim
fuck all you fair-weather friends, all i need is him
fuckin' backstabbers
when the chips were down, you just laughed at us
now you 'bout to feel the fuckin' wrath of aftermath, faggots
you gon' see us in our lab jackets and ask where the fuck we been?
you can kiss my indecisive ass crack, maggots
and the cracker's ass, little cracker jack beat
makin' wack math, backwards producers; i'm back, bastards
one more cd and then i'm packin' up my bags
and as i'm leavin', i'll guarantee they'll scream:
"dre, don't leave us like that, man", 'causeâ€”
