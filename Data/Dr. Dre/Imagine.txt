imagine it never happened
imagine no rappin'
imagine niggas trapped imagining having action
imagine how these niggas could be actin' if we never got this shit crackin'
imagine life's so hard
you can't imagine, it's like livin' in the city of god, you feel me?
imagine life on the yard
or tryna get that dollar on some shitty ass job
imagine biggie with his son
imagine pac gettin' called "pop" by one
imagine a mother struggling
dealing with a system that don't give a fuck about who shot her son, hm
imagine life where you can't win
when you get out of the ghetto and go right to the pen
when you get out to the pen, you go right to the gin
so if you get back to the streets, you go right back in, hm
imagine russell still struggling
no def jam, just another nigga hustlin'
and ain't no rocks on them fellas
just rocks on them fellas, just tryna keep it bubblin'
imagine niggas just stuck
from the east to the west coast, everybody fucked up
i can't imagine no less
but it don't take imagination to know niggas been blessed with hip-hop
