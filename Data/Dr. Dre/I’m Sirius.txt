too often, is a young nigga, in a coffin
tryna blossom, got shot down walkin', heh
bleek a high-to-hot guy, turned cold
bring the body bag, see the bullet hole and a burned soul
don't cry, he chose the life
fast lane, in the brain, he supposed to fight
how you smile at a momma when she lost a child?
(*gunshots*) they done shot my baby!
