ay, ay, hold up a minute
let me stop up here and use this payphone real quick
(*telephone dialing, sighs*)
ay, ay, toni, it's me
i was just callin', you know, just callin' to let you know
don't wait up for me tonight
i mean, i just got a lot of things on my mind i gotta think about, you know
just um, i'll be up at brian's house
you know, just for the night
i mean, i mean i know things are different, but you know
it's not you, it's me, you know, it's really me, you know
and basically, i just think i'ma need some space


i mean, you gotta understand i love you
you know what i'm sayin'?
and i love you enough to say that i think
i think you deserve somebody better than me, you know
and right now, i can't give you what you need, you know
i mean, i wanna love you
well, i'm gonna love you one day, but you know
i mean, you just gotta understand where i'm comin' from
