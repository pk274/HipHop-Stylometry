actin' a fool, a player that paid his dues
and got my receipt in return, so i recline the leather seats
with a trunk full of beats and
chronic filled leafs to burn
no concern as i make a left turn on the 'shaw (what)
off of jefferson, feelin' awfully naked at the u-turn
huh, left my gun, that's a no-no
fuck bernard parks, i'm my own po'-po'
see him talkin' dirty after dark, startin' stuff
may have to mark up a fool fubu logo
lettin' off like a ruger promo
and even though i'm about the hoes, i never doubt the dulos
you know the rule goes, where there's a ho, there's a hater
well, there's some hoes over there
i'll concentrate on the haters later (what)
give these bitches numbers to the pager
invite 'em to the next dre function as party favors
who said pimpin's hard labor?
