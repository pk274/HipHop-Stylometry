dippin' down compton boulevard
i only rides with my dogs (say what)
i don't give a fuck about none of y'all (fuck y'all)
i'm ridin 'til the wheels fall off
i only rides with my dogs


uhh, actin a fool, nigga done paid his dues
and got my receipt in return, so i recline the leather seats
with a trunk full of beats and
chronic filled leafs to burn
no concern as i make a left turn on the 'shaw ('sup nigga)
off of jefferson, feelin' awfully naked at the u-turn
shit, left my gun, that's a no-no
fuck bernard parks, i'm my own po'-po'
nigga talkin' dirty after dark, startin' stuff (what's up nigga)
may have to mark up a nigga fubu logo
lettin off like a ruger promo
and even though i'm about the hoes, i never doubt the dulos
you know the rule goes, where there's a ho there's a hater
(fuck them niggas) well there's some hoes over there
and i concentrate on the haters later (what)
give these bitches numbers to the pager
invite 'em to the next dre function as party favors
who said pimpin's hard labor?
