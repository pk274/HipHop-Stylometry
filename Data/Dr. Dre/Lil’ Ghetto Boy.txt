—so, all of you africans
all of you africans that know how to do things that's working for other people
y'all need to open your own business
save your money, quit paying motherfuckers for jheri curls
quit paying motherfuckers for perms
save your money, start your own business
so all these little africans will have wa— places to work
this is our future right here
this our future right here (right there)
this— (the new generation is goin', the new generation)
hey, i'ma tell you right now
if— if— if i have to die today, for this little african right here to have a future, i'm a dead motherfucker (you right, respect)


now i'm holdin' a dub, sittin' on swoll
twenty-seven years old, up for parole, stroll
i'm back up on my feet with my mind on the money
that i'll be makin' soon as i touch the streets
things done changed on this side
remember they used to thump, but now they blast, right
but it ain't no thang to me
'cause now i'm what they call a loced-assed og
the lil' homies from the hood with grip
are the ones i get with 'cause i'm down to set trip
nigga, i'm bigger than you, so what you wanna do?
didn't know he had a twenty-two
straight sittin' behind his back
i grabbed his pockets and then i heard six caps
i fell to the ground with blood on my hands
i didn't understand
how a nigga so young could bust a cap
i used to be the same way back
i guess that's what i get (for what?)
for tryin' to jack the lil' homies for they grip
