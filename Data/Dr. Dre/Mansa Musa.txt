now i've been on some different shit lately
like i need to dumb it down for this hip hop scene
like i only come around for this type shit here
if i have to bust around, it's on the hits, my dear
now what we gwan do with all these hits over here?
go up in smoke when i disappear, reappear
hah, i'm just bein' sincere
boss shit, how we do it? crack music, top tier, nigga
shut it down, my nigga, chill
we could see right through that bullshit
you pussy, nigga, we could tell
better believe my product sell
made a billion off my bullshit and did it, nigga, high as hell
overachiever, nigga, i excel
if my name is on this muhfucker, better believe the stock's up
professional winners around us
gotta fly, leave the buildin', levitatin' on you motherfucks
