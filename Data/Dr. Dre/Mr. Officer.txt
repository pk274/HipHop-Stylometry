sitting in my living room, calm and collected
feeling that gotta-kill-a-cop perspective
'cause what i just heard broke me in half
so fuck daryl gates and the whole police staff
laugh now, but cry much later
you see when niggas get together
they get mad 'cause they can't fade us
like my niggas from south central, los angeles
they found that they couldn't handle us
bloods, crips on the same squad
with the ese's helpin', nigga, it's time to rob and mob
(and break the white man off something lovely
i don't love dem so dem can't love me)
yo, straight puttin' it down, gettin' my scoot on
it's jumping off in compton so i gots to get my loot on
and come up on me some furniture or somethin'
got a vcr in the back of my car
that i ganked from the slauson swap meet
and the police better not try to stop me
'cause they will see that i can't be stopped
'cause i gives a fuck about a motherfucking cop
