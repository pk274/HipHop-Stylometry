dance, everybody, and everybody just clap your hands
i said we're here to do what we wanna do for all you rockin' fans
with lonzo, yella, shakespeare and my name is dr. dre
it's called "must be the music", but it's done the world class way
so just dance, everybody, and everybody just hit the floor
it's the devastating sounds of the wreckin' cru
so you couldn't ask for more
it's an old school cut from '82
done funky fresh by the wreckin' cru
so if you'll listen close you'll surely find
you're listening to the sounds of the mastermind, oh yeah
