there's no mountain i can't climb
there's no tower too high, no plane that i can't learn how to fly
what do i gotta do to get through to you
to show you there ain't nothin' i can't take this chainsaw to?
(rahhnnn!) fuckin' brains, brawn and brass balls
i cut 'em off and got 'em pickled and bronzed in a glass jar
inside of a hall, with my framed autographed sunglasses
with elton john's name on my drag wall
i'm out the closet, i've been lyin' my ass off
all this time, me and dre been fuckin' with hats off
(suck it, marshall!) so tell laura and her husband to back off
'fore i push this motherfuckin' button and blast off
and launch one of these russians, and that's all
blow every fuckin' thing except afghanistan on the map off
when will it stop? when will i knock the crap off?
(*knocking*) hailie, tell 'em, baby! (my dad's lost it!)
