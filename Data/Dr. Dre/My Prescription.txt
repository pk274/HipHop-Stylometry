thank you for bein patient, i got ya application
i know you been waitin to see the doctor!
here it is, here i am, here it is, here i am
yes, yo push is right back up in the scene
yes, my dope is so methamphetamine
yes, it's coke i've laced inside every beat
shit, i'm tryna get ya high
you been sittin in the waitin room far too long
too late for aa, you're far too gone
i know you can't take these awful songs
like a punk full of bullshit, nigga hell nah
they want some real shit (right now!)
they want the real (right now!) relax, i got you
good thing i had a couple hundred tums layin' around
nigga dispenseries, servin' by the pound
back in business, bigger than we ever was
it's aftermath nigga, you know you heard of us
we're leavin narcotics on every note
we just struttin the streets, like when the levee broke
i got the antidote
i got ya hands goin up and down, you done fucked up now
but it's hard to go back to that bullshit
and whatever's on the bar, d.r. is gonna push it
