i woke up this morning thinkin' 'bout the old me
when i was feeling like miller lite and ol' e
but now i ride on some conscious shit
i'm getting bread while i toast to my accomplishments
only one i could have a problem with is myself
that's probably why my only competition is myself
from today to tomorrow, the doc is just rocking the same drum
fuck the past, though i ain't forgot where i came from
i got the club rocking, uh
i got your girl jocking, uh
me and fif' still in this bitch, bitch
we goin' the distance with you party people, come on
