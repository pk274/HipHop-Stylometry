rehab (relapse)
yeah fuck it, i'ma try again tomorrow
i'm addicted to being a star
if you ain't never had a taste, then no wonder you ain't buyin' out the bar
with no bitches on your arm
it's the fuck to the mornin'
groupy love in the club is like crack
(quit calling me man) relapse
just when i thought i had enough of you i hear a voice saying

come on
get up (get up)
step up (step up)
let's get (let's get)
toe up (go)
(drink, drink, drink)
follow me into the future
