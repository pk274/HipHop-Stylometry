why do i call myself a nigga you ask me?
i guess it's just the way shit has to be
back when i was young gettin' a job was murder
fuck flippin' burgers, cause i deserve a
nine-to-five i can be proud of, that i can speak loud of
and to help a nigga get out of
yo! the concrete playground
but most motherfuckers only want you to stay down
but i'm a smart motherfucker you see
one of the best producers in the rap music industry
gettin' paid like a motherfucker
a young brother, who don't give a fuck about another
yeah


why do i call myself a nigga you ask me?
because my mouth is so motherfuckin' nasty
bitch this, bitch that, nigga this, nigga that
in the mean while my pockets are gettin' fat
gettin' paid to say this shit here
makin' more in a week than a doctor makes in a year
so why not call myself a nigga?
it's better than pullin' the trigger and goin' up the river
and then i get called a nigga anyway
broke as a motherfucker and locked away, so
so cut out all that bullshit
yo! i guess i'll be a nigga for life


nigga this, nigga that
the actual fact is that i'm black and bound to attract
the attention of another, i mean the other
but i'm a motherfucker that'll have 'em runnin' for cover
you see, i don't give a fuck about nothin'
except gettin' paid, gettin' bitches, and issuin' stitches
which is, all needed to read it and find a rhyme
and then it's time to say, the nigga's here to stay
but what about the fake niggas, the house niggas
to get paid quick they gotta suck a fat dick
but n.w.a. is outta your motherfuckin' range
we ain't gonna change a motherfuckin' thang!
