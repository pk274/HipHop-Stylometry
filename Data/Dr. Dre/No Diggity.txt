it's going down, fade to blackstreet
the homies got at me, collab' creations bump like acne
no doubt, i put it down, never slouch
as long as my credit can vouch, a dog couldn't catch me **** out
tell me who can stop when dre makin' moves
attracting honeys like a magnet
giving 'em eargasms with my mellow accent
still moving this flavor
with the homies blackstreet and teddy
the original rump shakers
