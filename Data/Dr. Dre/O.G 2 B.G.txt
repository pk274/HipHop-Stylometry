i was about 16 years old
runnin the streets of south central
nigga, straight fuckin' up
every party that i went to
i had to stuck a frame
for my name is dre
what the fuck you say
i think he saw the handle on my .44
when he get seated
22 i was reachin' fo’
i show you how you do when shit blow up
1, 2, 3 it's that
your party over nigga
move on to the next one
you should've brought a few mo' niggas
for some protection
you fuckin' with notorious ass g's
you never get passed these
1, 2, 3, 4, 5 think is that we straight dumpin'
that's why i’m always into somethin’
i faded, faded till that nigga broke
to show that i ain't no motherfuckin’ joke
? somethin' thought he could check me
but the guard sent his ass directly
yo, to his g-r-a-v-e
bein' stupid try to p-l-a-y me
yo, listen well to me
spell it to the underground
nobody playin' pussy
so i’m layin' it down
a little somethin' from the motherfuckin' d.r.e
from o.g. 2 b.g
