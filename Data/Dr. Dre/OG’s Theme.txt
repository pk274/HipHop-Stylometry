(ah!) west side keep it thuggin' like
after me there will never be another like (hell yeah!)
bad hoes, palm trees, bomb weed
stack cheese, i'm the original (gangsta!)


the first nigga with an attitude
with thirty mil' sold, where the fuck the gratitude?
huh, i see all these little bg's
mean muggin' on the screen, tryna be me
huh, i'm much more than 6-4's
gun talk, chronic leaves and thick hoes
that's why most of them have come and went
i just recoup, recreate and reinvent
nigga, welcome to the west coast
we home of the jackers and the best smoke
and ain't no nigga better than doc dre, i'm a twenty-year veteran
bitch i run this whole time zone
'bout to show these young niggas how to grind homes
i hope you got it while you had the chance
your run's over, now get ready for the aftermath


(ah!) west side keep it thuggin' like
after me there will never be another like (hell yeah!)
bad hoes, palm trees, bomb weed
stack cheese, i'm the original (gangsta!)
