i'm dre, from back in the day, from
n.w.a, from black and the gray, from
choking a bitch, to smacking her face, from
stacking up bodies, to racking aks up
from racking up hits, to stacking them crates up
i'm still hungry, and i'm back with a tapeworm
and we're what's happenin' in rap entertainment
me and shady, as far as competition, faggot, there ain't none


now where there's smoke, there's fire
where there's fire, there's flames
where there's flames, there's chronic
either you high or you ain't
i got no time for no games


now put your smoke up in the air, raise your henny and coke
and if you really wanna get fucked up, just let me know
we can smoke, 'til there's no more lighter fluid to do it
let's get into it, you're smokin' with the triedest and truest
i got the midas touch when it comes to rollin' shit up
you, motherfuckers, ain't smokin', you just holdin' shit up
now here we go, let's get up, get down, hold up a blunt
i smoke the kinda stuff that make the records go number one
'cause if at first you don't succeed, won't hurt to smoke some weed
now them words are just a little more personal for me
seeing as how i blew up off of puffing them trees


well, smoke enough for me, fuck, yeah, light it up, cheech
come on, smoke me out cuz, give me contact buzz
get me on track, they love me when i'm on that stuff
but this is earth calling shady, man, come on back—what?
man, we're losing him, he won't even respond back, fuck!
now look at all the pretty women in here (damn, bitches!)
dre, it's hot, i think we better go check on their temperatures
i'll get the thermometer, you get the bandages
now, baby, just bend over, this won't hurt a damn bit, just—
