i spark like a blunt's tip, somethin cavi
makin greene like mitch, gives rap vocals dispatch
with every attempt, to have this game shook up
when dre cook up, every thug look up
chronic got me on tilt, eyes bloodshot, heavy built
lay a nigga out like quilt, clear to gill
i rock for rollers, from lowriders to henny toasters
cut off dead weight to keep my formulas kosher
accept no imitations dre losin his stack
is slim as chances, of michael jackson gettin his black fans back
my reputation's like a tec-9
knock out the best in a circle, three minutes wreck time
see the hand is faster than the eye can chase it
dre, b-real, soul assassins got potential buttons activated
no illusion i have you caught up in the rapture
executive decisions from the motherfucking puppet masters


you are the puppet, i pull your string, i'm makin moves
i'm the master, causing you to do what you do
puppet masters
