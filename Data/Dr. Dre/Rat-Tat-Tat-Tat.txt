rat-tat-tat-tat late at night with my gat
on the streets of l.a. wonderin' where the pussy at
straight player, lookin' for a ho
hangin' out, rollin' in my six-four
sixteen switches for the niggas in my hood
seventeen shells, so i make it understood
stay back, lay back, way back in the cut
ya come outside, nigga, ya gettin' fucked up
i done told ya, creep-creep, ya best move
like luther vandross, i'm fuckin' up the west coast
i'm right back up in ya when ya nut
one, two, three nut, from the d-r-e but
this is for the hoes that i used to know
when i didn't have my sixty-four and a lot of dough
i keep it like this and like that, and i
never hesitate to put a nigga on his back


rat-tat-tat-tat, tat-ta-tat, like that, and i
never hesitate to put a nigga on his back
rat-tat-tat-tat, tat-ta-tat, like that, and i
never hesitate to put a nigga on his back


never hesitate to put a nigga on his back (yeah, nigga)


rat-tat-tat-tat, tat-ta-tat, like that, you know i
never hesitate to put a nigga on his back
rat-tat-tat-tat, tat-ta-tat, like that, and i
never hesitate to put a nigga on his back
rat-tat-tat-tat, tat-ta-tat, like that, you know i
never hesitate to put a nigga on his back (yeah)
rat-tat-tat-tat, tat-ta-tat, like that, and i
never hesitate to put a nigga on his back


creepin' and peepin' and we can get with these
the chronic, slangin' fat ki's from my block
and it don't stop, tell me where you wanna go
to the strip, or take a trip ballin' with the row
my shit off in your system attacks
indo smoke go in your lungs like that
you get lifted, calm, and if it's the bomb
taken away like calgon, vietnam
california, back and on a mission
provin' a point, in my game, ain't no fuckin' competition
they wishin' but run up on reality
c-p-t, c-a-l my locality
it's strange how i re-arrange and change
the business by droppin' shit like this
dope, niggas can't cope with the real
i bill, penitentiary steel, when i kill, it goes


rat-tat-tat-tat, tat-ta-tat, like that, and i
never hesitate to put a nigga on his back (yeah)
rat-tat-tat-tat, tat-ta-tat, like that, you know i
never hesitate to put a nigga on his back
rat-tat-tat-tat, tat-ta-tat, like that, and i
never hesitate to put a nigga on his back (hell yeah)
rat-tat-tat-tat, tat-ta-tat, like that, you know i
never hesitate to put a nigga on his back
