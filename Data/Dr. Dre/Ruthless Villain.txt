yo dre, how much time we got left on this tape?
about a couple of minutes
well let me bust a freestyle then
aight, go ahead
ruthless gangsta, definition: villain
leave your shit unlocked and he's stealin'
so call tha police cause that's all you could do
but he'll get away without leavin' a clue
wait a minute, wait a minute, cut this shit
ayo yella boy, won't you rewind it
hey man, you gotta get more hyped up than that
damn, why don't you pump this shit up, so it could fuck with my eardrums a little bit?
aight, bet
