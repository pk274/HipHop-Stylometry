yeah, i mean, i listen to these rap records
half the time i'm suspicious
you niggas sound so fictitious
believe me, i know the difference
i got some words for you niggas
you're the definition of (satisfiction)
listen up, i been where you goin' three times and plus
big houses, cars, jewelry, bad bitches all around this motherfucker, uh
i seen it all and guess what?
it's the (satisfiction), you feel me?

i'm just statin' the facts
don't get no realer than that
satisfiction, attention, listen, play your position, player
shouldn't be too hard, my nigga
it's supposed to be like a lay up
shouldn't be so hard to be yourself
my nigga, wake up
stay up, pay up, straight up, cake up
that's what i'm made of, high? yup
my life is all authentic, that's why i'm goin' way up
your satisfaction fictitious, your happiness is made up
