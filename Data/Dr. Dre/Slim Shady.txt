iâ€™m assuming you don't want to battle
that will be your dying day
into your house bullets will rattle
you just cannot win this fray
don't believe me ask ray (cornrows)
(i heard he thinks he's gangsta), but he's really not though
(so don't fuck with slim), that's the goal
(he'll burn your house down), and relocate you to the motorhomes
holdin' pullin' moldin' chrome
oldest, dopest, grossest flow
killer, father, loving home
family jealous of all this gold
everybody wants a million from shady
even the goddamn motherfuckers who hate me
but i stays crazy, and sprayz aks at babys
me and drezy (yeah slim your shady)


mothefucker i told you i was (crazy)
the game done helped (shape me)
the only thing left to (say b)
is hey (slim your shady)
mothefucker i told you i was (crazy)

the only thing left to (say b)
