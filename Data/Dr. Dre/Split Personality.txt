yeah, i'm just sittin' in the lab, i'm...
my name is dr. dre, and
i want all you mothafuckers out there to know
that i have a split personality (*mr. ski chuckles*)
and sometimes i just, exit through these things, you know
ha ha, you know, hell yeah..


diagnosis, multiple personality disorder of modern day
with modern tech, jugglin' hard in a leg' versus manslaughter
i took a swig of the potion and it sent me coastin'
with visions of my alter-ego hittin' three wheel motion
"is it dre, is it dre"
no that ski in a purple 6-tray g.t.a
killin' any mothafucker walkin'
and all these niggas in these magazines that keep on talkin'
don't get twisted, i been there, i done that
but ski's out control and maniac
he just show me that he got my back "i just show him i got your back"
see, in a lot of there, i'm straight
i'm dr. dre, but after stroke of mid night
iâ€™m mr. ski a.k.a. dooms day
concocted the shit up in my lab
with mr. ski up in my head, bringin' on the aftermath
you can see the stars runnin' from the sky
tryin' to get away from dr. dre and mr. s-k-i





i start shakin'
test tools and bottles start breakin' (*glass crush*)
my ulti-eagle starts overtakin'
instantly spinnin' around like the mass
tossin' that shit up off like a twister
no longer, the docter or mister "ski"
i can't hold it back
i'm trapped behind the walls of my brains, tryin' to count a rack
"even though tryin' to fight"
my vocal tone ignited into a loud scream "how high"
it's time to get the fuck up off, yeah
