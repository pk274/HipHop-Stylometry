i'm still saucin
cause i'm the boss and
say they flossin'
cause it’s compton
every baddest bitch who wants to get broke off
thats how i do it, get into it
with the fluid, and i thought you knew it
doing it like this and doing it like that
and, uh, when it comes to gats the nine has to know i'm rastlin
why try to put up a fight when i can just grab my chrome and put it to your dome?
only make ya thank, so before you try to gank
would you ask your stank about my bank or ya strength
(the 1-5-1)
cause that's what you're dealing with
my 9 double-m, that's what i kill 'em with
if you keep coming at the doc like he's (crazy)
fucking with snoop, you’ll be pushing up daisies
niggas who talk shit really don't (faze me)
cause ain't nothing but a 'g' thang (baby)


for one of forty-four ways
the motherfuckin' d-r-e is getting paid
cause i fade, the shit's made, i lay real shit
never let no motherfucker feel shit
that's something dre can never deal with
i don't want no motherfuckin' bitches on my roster
cross the road when you know we're gonna cross ya
you don't want no problems then
so get my motherfuckin' nuts, i rock cuts then fuck sluts
so what's the deal?
as i reveal
the true feeling that i know you wanna feel
still do it like a motherfuckin' nigga for life
if you slippin with your bitch then i'll be fucking your wife
they call me dre but also the notorious one
dre g, thats why i'm always holding my gun
gun days then went months and sold blunts
that made it that fat
on top of that, they don't know where my stash at
yo, so business was as usual
ain't no trippin' because i know you know what i do to you
the o-n-e, the m-u-r-d-e-r
you'll never make it to tomorrow
if, you come at me like i'm crazy
take a look at how the streets straight raised me
and how your whole motherfuckin' city plays me
cause ain't nothing but a g thang (baby)
