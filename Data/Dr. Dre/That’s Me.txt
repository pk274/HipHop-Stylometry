(yeah) i been down, been up, been down
i been down, been up, been down
i been down, down, down (yeah)


you know it's money money money niggas
don't wanna breathe the same air as these funny niggas
that's the reason why i never really fuck with niggas
i mean you watch your fuckin' mind if you up against us
these are niggas are soundin' so postmortem
same tricks, same shit, and so borin' (yah)
corporate bully? i am that fully
don't you ever push or pull me
robbin' niggas blind, no mask, no hoodie (nigga)
i know you love to hate, but this shit is contagious
money like a foreign language to you fuckin' strangers
niggas ain't even worth my mother fuckin' middle finger
so my "fuck you" should be considered as a fuckin' blessin'
take a lesson nigga (uh)
