what happened in hip-hop that got pac and big shot?
the thicks blocks, now every rapper claim he let his clip pop
but even myself tote a gun, and know to run than get shot
i've been there before now i'm fuckin' with doc
(gotta do them calvin broadus numbers)
if not, i pitch rocks, anticipatin' my incarceration
media think i'm fakin' like mason, but when it comes to mace
fuck r. kelly, i don't take it in the face
i find out who sprayed it, and i'm puttin' you under the pavement
no buddhist priest, catholic, or baptist pastor can save him
i'm far from religious, but i got beliefs
so i put canary yellow diamonds in my jesus piece
i came back from the dead without a part of my chest
laid in a hospital bed on cardiac arrest
i waited for 3 years while everybody else dropped
now i understand why nas did a song with his pops


i'm ready to die without a reasonable doubt
smoke chronic and hit it doggystyle before i go out
until they sign my death certificate, all eyez on me
i'm still at it, illmatic, and that's the documentary
ready to die without a reasonable doubt
smoke chronic and hit it doggystyle before i go out
until they sign my death certificate, all eyez on me
i'm still at it, illmatic, and that's the documentary (the documentary)
