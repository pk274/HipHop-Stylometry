i'm still on top of the game
still droppin' flames, still cock and aim
still at the top, had to rock for the fame
over setbacks, there's been a lot since i came
you seen it all, how i got, how i gained
the momentum when it dropped, how i got through the pain
when i roll and shock, they watched me reclaim
the streets, they made a special spot for my name
dre, haters want a stop to my reign
but the music lives in me, every drop in my veins
the pride and the pain
all the way back from the rise of my name
see the world clear through the eyes of the man
see the world cheer for the rhymes that i gave
when the beat bangs, it'll drive 'em insane, the odds that i played
the best to emerge in the game: it's the watcher
