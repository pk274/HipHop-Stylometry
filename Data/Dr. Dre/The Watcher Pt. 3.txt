things just ain't the same for gangsters
a lot of fake emcees, punks, and wanksters
r&b niggas wanna g niggas
i tell you jam i'm gonna have to go and see niggas
and pay you peasants a visit, my presence up in it
and it won't be no pleasant-able visit
see, i'mma reputable with it, just skeptical with it
i'm professional with it
you get it, you got it, you shoot it, you shot it
plot it from the get-go
i'm the only west coast nigga that get love on the east coast
and swing it back down to detroit to chi-town
motherfucker, how you like me now?
and i'm not the little one, i'm the big bow wow
w-ballz, we do it doggystyle
we flippin' the script, mackin' a bitch
it's pimpin' on this motherfuckin' track, and shit


everywhere that i go, ain't the same as before
people i used to know, just don't know me no more
but everywhere that i go, i got people i know
who got people they know, so i suggest you lay low


i'm still on top of the game
still dropping flames, still cock and aim
still at the top had to rock for the fame
over setbacks, there's been a lot since i came
you seen it all, how i got, how i gained
the momentum when it dropped, how i got through the pain
when i roll and shock, they watched me reclaim
the streets, they made a special spot for my name
dre, haters wanna stop to my reign
but the music lives in me, every drop in my veins
the pride and the pain
all the way back from the rise of my name
see the world clear through the eyes of the mane
see the world cheer for the rhymes that i gave
when the beat bangs it'll drive them insane
the eyes that i played, the best to emerge in the game is the watcher


as soon as your clear in my scope i got you (got you)
red dot you (red dot you)
the watcher
fools can't touch aftermath we to hot (we to hot)
you can't stop us
watch us
motherfuckers think they can do that
i got you, when i spot you, got you
it's too late if you see me on your block-uh
with my glock cocked and call the doctor
