on a mission tryna spend what i can’t take with me

and you ain’t gotta like me i’ma still ball
even if i choose to take a couple years off
upon my return, i’ma still floss
even harder though, so let the robber know
“hey haters do you thing, got my shine regardless though”
when it seem like it’s over, i’ma make a wave
by whatever means and that’s what make him dre
my heart consumed with determination got to say

oh, look at me when the beat drop
it’s on again, i welcome you to the detox, oh
i’ve been waiting for the perfect time to hit the block serve this
