when the bottles gettinâ€™ low, we just order some more
and the owner know me, so the chronic can blow
you can find me in the back when you ready to roll
and we gon' party all night untill the club close
you know i came through the back door
still with the crack flow
west coast requested, this what they asked for
so put your glass in the air
and i'ma feel that bitch up till the club close
and you know, ain't another nigga colder than him
i'm feeling like '01 all over again
and my nigga snoop dogg all over your friend
and he gone probably be there till the club close, sayin'
