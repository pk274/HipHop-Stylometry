pow!
guns blaze when i shine
make a wish quick, no star and i'm the shooting kind
pow!
front page all the time
you boys think sick, but i ain't got no roof on mine
i dream topless, i live topless
like my girl is the game with her titties out
i dream topless, i live topless
sky is the limit, i'm paid to run the city now (city now, city now)
