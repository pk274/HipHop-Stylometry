thangs just ain't the same since he came out
two thousand and one, came blew the game out
i heard you was hot, blew your flame out
and got the nerve to believe you hold the same clout
i thought i told you, keep my name out of your fuckin' mouth
(but dr. dre!) see that's exactly what i'm talkin' bout
that shit right there, that's all day long
just don't stop, i gots to be alone at the top
forever ready loaded and locked, with niggas that'll circle yo' block
and let 'em pop 'til some bodies get dropped
it's doc holiday in the flesh
(still) hold it down, represent, resurrect the west
(still) holdin' ground, touchin' down, with my nigga x
(still) send a couple through yo' chest if you disrespect
dr. dre comin' back (shit) i never left
the number one ranked highest paid celebrity guest
that's eight digits, motherfuckers


you know, who's runnin' these fuckin' streets
(you get involved, you gettin slapped with the heat nigga)
don't be actin' like your shit don't stink (c'mon)
y'all ain't fuckin' with x
you know, we roll so fuckin' deep
(yeah round after round in the middle of the street niggas)
'cause you're actin' like your shit don't stink (yo)
y'all ain't fuckin' with x
