niggas is so gangsta, niggas is thugs
niggas'll spend their whole life peddling drugs
slanging dope in hopes of one day bein able
to own their own label and give the game up
some niggas came up, some just didn't
that's just the way it is, if it ain't meant it just isn't
some niggas'll get money and pay niggas to back em'
so they can act up, feel comfortable, and rap tough
and that's as backwards, cuz them niggas just gone keep coming back
and that's when extortion happens
you struggle to get free, i know how this shit be
you deal with anything to live legitimately
but you gone find if you do get in this industry
it's best to be business me than against me
niggas get behind mics and ain't even mc's
niggas get on mtv just to diss me
