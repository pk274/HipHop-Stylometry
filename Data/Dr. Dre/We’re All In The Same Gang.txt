yo, we're not here to preach because we're not ministers
we're telling like it is cause ren and dre is like sinister
reality speaks for itself when it's spoken
a basehead cluck can't blame nobody for smoking
yo, bullets flying, mothers crying, brothers dying
lying in the streets, that's why we're trying
to stop it from falling apart and going to waste
and keeping a smile off of white face
n.w.a never preaching, just teaching
the knowledge of the streets to each and
all that don't understand, that's why we came
to let you know that we're all in the same gang
