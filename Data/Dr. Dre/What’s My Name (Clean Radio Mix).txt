from the depths of the sea, back to the block
snoop doggy dogg, funky as the, the, the d.o.c
went solo on that ass, but it's still the same
long beach is the spot where i serve my 'caine
follow me, follow me, follow me, follow me, but you better not slip
'cause nine-trizzay's the yizzear for me to clizzock my grip
so i ain't holdin' nuttin' back
and once again, i got five on the twenty sack
it's like that and as a mattеr of fact (rat-tat-tat-tat)
'cause i never hеsitate to put a fool on his back
yeah, so peep out the manuscript
you see that it's a must we drop gangsta...
hold up, what's my name?
