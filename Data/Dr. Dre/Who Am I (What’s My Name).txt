from the depths of the sea, back to the block
snoop doggy dogg, funky as the, the, the d.o.c.Â 
went solo on that ass, but it's still the same
long beach is the spot where i serve my 'caine
follow me, follow me, follow me, follow me, but don't lose your grip
nine-trizzay's the yizzear for me to fuck up shit
so i ain't holdin nothin' back
and motherfucker, i got five on a twenty sack
it's like that and as a matter of fact (rat-tat-tat-tat)
'cause i never hesitate to put a nigga on his back
yeah, so peep out the manuscript
you see that it's a must we drop gangsta shit
what's my motherfuckin' name?
