it's a long, lonely highway when you're travelling all alone
and it's a mean, old world when you got no one to call your own
and you pass through towns too small to even have a name, oh yes
but you gotta keep on going on that road to nowhere
gotta keep on going, though there's no one to care
just keep moving down the line


it's a long, lonely highway without her by my side
and it's a trail full of teardrops that keep on being cried
my heart's so heavy it's a low-down dirty shame, oh yes
you gotta keep on going on that road to nowhere
gotta keep on going, though there's no-one to care
just keep moving down the line


i got to rock for my pillow beneath a weeping willow
and the cool grass for my bed
my drinking water's muddy so don't you tell me, buddy
that i wouldn't be better off dead


it's a long, lonely highway, getting longer all the time
and if she don't come and get me, well, i'm gonna lose my mind
so if you read about me, tell her she's the one to blame, oh yes
you gotta keep on going on that road to nowhere
gotta keep on going, though there's no one to care
just keep moving down the line
moving down the line
moving down the line
