baby, let me be your loving teddy bear
put a chain around my neck
and lead me anywhere
oh, let me be (oh, let him be)
your teddy bear


i don't wanna to be a tiger
because tigers play too rough
i don't wanna be a lion
'cause lions ain't the kind you love enough


just wanna be your teddy bear
put a chain around my neck
and lead me anywhere
oh, let me be (oh, let him be)
your teddy bear


baby, let me be around you every night
run your fingers through my hair
and cuddle me real tight
oh, let me be (oh, let him be)
your teddy bear


i don't wanna to be a tiger
because tigers play too rough
i don't wanna be a lion
'cause lions ain't the kind you love enough


just wanna be your teddy bear
put a chain around my neck
and lead me anywhere
oh, let me be (oh, let him be)
your teddy bear


oh, let me be (oh, let him be)
your teddy bear
i just wanna be your teddy bear (whoo)
