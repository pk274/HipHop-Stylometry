some people like to rock
some people like to roll
but movin' and a-groovin' going to satisfy my soul


let's have a party (let's have a party)
let's have a party (let's have a party)
send 'em to the store
and let's buy some more
and let's have a party tonight


i've never kissed a bear
i've never kissed a goon
but i can shake a chicken in the middle of the room


let's have a party (let's have a party)
let's have a party (let's have a party)
send 'em to the store
and let's buy some more
and let's have a party tonight


now honky tonky joe
is knocking at the door
bring him in and fill him up and set him on the floor


let's have a party (let's have a party)
let's have a party (let's have a party)
send 'em to the store
and let's buy some more
and let's have a party tonight


the meat is on the stove
the bread is gettin' hot
everybody come and taste the possum poppa shot


let's have a party (let's have a party)
let's have a party (let's have a party)
send 'em to the store
and let's buy some more
and let's have a party tonight
we'll have a party tonight
