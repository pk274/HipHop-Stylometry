(now and then there's a fool such as i)


pardon me, if i'm sentimental
when we say goodbye
don't be angry with me should i cry
when you're gone, yet i'll dream a little
a little dream as years go by
now and then there's a fool such as i (fool such as i)


now and then there's a fool such as i am over you
you taught me how to love
and now you say that we are through
i'm a fool, but i'll love you, dear
until the day i die
now and then there's a fool such as i (fool such as i)
