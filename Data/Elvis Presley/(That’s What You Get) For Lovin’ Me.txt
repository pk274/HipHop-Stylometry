that's what you get for loving me
that's what you get for loving me
everything we had is gone, you can see
that's what you get for loving me


now don't you shed a tear for me
i ain't the love you thought i'd be
i've had a hundred just like you
but don't be blue i'll have a thousand before i'm through


that's what you get for loving me
that's what you get for loving me
everything we had is gone, you can see
that's what you get for loving me


now there you go, you're cryin' again
you should have known how things would end
but then someday when your poor heart is on the mend
i just might pass this way again


that's what you get for loving me
that's what you get for loving me
everything we had is gone, you can see
that's what you get for loving me
that's what you get for loving me
that's what you get for loving me
everything we had is gone, you can see
that's what you get for loving me
