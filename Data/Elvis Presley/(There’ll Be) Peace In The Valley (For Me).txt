oh, well, i'm tired and so weary, but i must go alone
'til the lord comes and calls, calls me away, oh, yes
well the mornin's so bright and the lamb is the light
and the night, the night is as black as the sea, oh, yes


there will be peace in the valley for me, someday
there will be peace in the valley for me, oh, lord, i pray
there'll be no sadness, no sorrow, no trouble, trouble i see
there will be peace in the valley for me


well, the bear will be gentle and the wolves will be tame
and the lion shall lay down by the lamb, oh, yes
and the beasts from the wild shall be led by a child
and i'll be changed, changed from this creature that i am, oh, yes


there will be peace in the valley for me, someday
there will be peace in the valley for me, oh, lord, i pray
there'll be no sadness, no sorrow, no trouble, trouble i see
there will be peace in the valley for me, for me
