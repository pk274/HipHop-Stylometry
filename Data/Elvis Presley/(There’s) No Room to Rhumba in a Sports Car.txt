this was gonna be the night tonight
i was gonna get to hold you tight
but i guess we didn't plan it right
i never stood a chance, we couldn't dance


'cause there's no room to rhumba in a sports car
you can't move forward or back
there's no room to do what the beat tells you to
without throwing your spine outta wack


when a little kiss i want to steal
i hit my head against the steering wheel
now i know the way a pretzel feels
all i can do is shout. hey let me out!!


'cause there's no room to rhumba in a sports car
you can't move forward or back
there's no room to do what the beat tells you to
without throwing your spine outta wack


what a way to waste away our youth
nothing happens here, to tell the truth
let's get out and find a telephone booth
yeah, that's a better place, i like more space


because there's no room to rhumba in a sports car
you can't move forward or back
there's no room to do what the beat tells you to
without throwing your spine outta wack
