you don't like crazy music
don't like rocking bands
you just wanna go to a movie show
and sit there holding hands


you're so square
baby, i don't care


you don't like hot rod racing
or driving late at night
you just wanna park where it's nice and dark
you just wanna hold me tight


you're so square
baby, i don't care

you don't know any dance steps that are new
but no one else could love me like you do, do, do, do


i don't know why my heart flips
i only know it does
i wonder why i love you, babe
i guess it's just because


you're so square
baby, i don't care
baby, i don't care
baby, i don't care
baby, i don't care


i don't know why my heart flips
i only know it does
i wonder why i love you, babe
i guess it's just because


you're so square
baby, i don't care
baby, i don't care
baby, i don't care, care, care, care
i don't care, care, care, care
