hey baby, i ain't asking much of you
no no no no no no no no baby, i ain't asking much of you
just a big-a big-a big-a hunk of love will do


don't be a stingy little mama
you're 'bout to starve me half to death
now you can spare a kiss or two and
still have plenty left, no no no
baby, i ain't asking much of you
just a big-a big-a big-a hunk of love will do


you're just a natural born beehive
filled with honey to the top
but i ain't greedy, baby
all i want is all you got, no no no
i ain't asking much of you
just a big-a big-a big-a hunk of love will do


i got a wishbone in my pocket
i got a rabbit foot around my wrist
you know i'd have all of the things my lucky charms could bring
if you give me just a one sweet kiss
oh no no no no no no no no
baby, i ain't asking much of you
just a big a hunk o' hunk o' hunk o' love will do, that's right
just a big a big a big a hunk o' love will do, that's right
just a big a big a big a hunk o' love will do, that's right
just a big a big a big a hunk o' love
