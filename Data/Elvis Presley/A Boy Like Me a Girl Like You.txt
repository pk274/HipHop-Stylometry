when a boy like me meets a girl like you
then i must believe wishes come true
i just look at you and i touch your hand
and this ordinary world becomes a wonderland


there are many girls i have met before
but i passed them by because i knew
there would be this magic moment
one to last a lifetime through
when a boy like me meets a girl like you

one to last a lifetime through
when a boy like me meets a girl like you
