if i had my life to live over
i know just what i'd like to be
a pampered pet of a rich brunette
sitting on my mama's knee
someone to love me, someone to care
rub-a-dub dubble little fingers through my hair


i need a dog's life
what a life, that's good enough for me
that's good enough for me


if i had a bone to be picking
i'd be picking chicken or a steak
curled up there in an easy chair
man, that won't be hard to take
i'll always be faithful, that's what i'd be
never bite a hand that feeds me, no siree




i'd find me a pink little poodle
and lose my noodle over her
i chase her around all over town
just to ruffle up her fur
nuzzle her muzzle, a holding her paw
greatest case of puppy loving you ever saw


it's called a dog's life
what a life, that's good enough for me
you heard me say it now
that's good enough for me
that's good enough for me
