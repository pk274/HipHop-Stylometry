i can see you now living like a queen
in a house that has everything, everything but love
crystal chandeliers, chauffeured limousines
yes you'll really have everything, everything but love


i see diamonds and sables, sapphires and pearls
and as the picture clears
poor little rich girl sitting all alone
counting her treasures in tears
better just a shack where two people care
than a house that has everything, everything but love
