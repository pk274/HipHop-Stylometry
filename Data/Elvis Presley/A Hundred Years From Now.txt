well a hundred years from now i won't be crying
a hundred years from now i won't be blue
my heart will have to forget that we ever met
but i won't care a hundred years from now


i'll never forget sweetheart the night you told me
that you couldn't live without my love somehow
that's all in the past i knew it wouldn't last
but i won't care a hundred years from now


well a hundred years from now i won't be crying
a hundred years from now i won't be blue
my heart will have to forget that we ever met
but i won't care a hundred years from now


well a hundred years from now i won't be crying
a hundred years from now i won't be blue
my heart will have to forget that we ever met
but i won't care a hundred years from now


well a hundred years from now i won't be crying
a hundred years from now i won't be blue
my heart will have to forget that we ever met
but i won't care a hundred years from now
