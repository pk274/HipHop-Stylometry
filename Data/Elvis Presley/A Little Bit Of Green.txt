now that the truth is hard to face
i can't forget you once were mine
someone else is in my place
whenever we meet my heart beats out of time


just a little bit of green
clouds my eyes to what i've seen
just a little bit of green
when i see you with someone new
and knowing that there's nothing i can do


please don't try to tie me down
those are the words you often say
i can't help seeing you around
you smile with surprise, i turn my eyes away




oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh




oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
just a little bit of green
