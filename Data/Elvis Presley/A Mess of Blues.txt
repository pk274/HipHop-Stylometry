i just got your letter baby
too bad you can't come home
i swear i'm going crazy
sitting here all alone
since you're gone
i got a mess of blues

i ain't slept a wink since sunday
i can't eat a thing all day
every day is just blue monday
since you've been away
since you're gone
i got a mess of blues


whoops, there goes a teardrop
rolling down my face
if you cry when you're in love
it sure ain't no disgrace


i gotta get myself together
before i lose my mind
i'm gonna catch the next train going
and leave my blues behind
since you're gone
i got a mess of blues


whoops, there goes a teardrop
rolling down my face
if you cry when you're in love
it sure ain't no disgrace


i gotta get myself together
before i lose my mind
i'm gonna catch the next train goin'
and leave my blues behind
since you're gone
i got a mess of blues


since you're gone i got a mess of blues
since you're gone i got a mess of blues
