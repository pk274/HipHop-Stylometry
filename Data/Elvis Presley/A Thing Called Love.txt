ooh, love, a thing called love


six foot six he stood on the ground, he weighed 235 pounds
but i saw that giant of a man brought down to his knees by love
he was the kind of a man who would gamble on luck
look you in the eye and never back up
but i saw him crying like a little whipped pup because of love


you can't see it with your eyes, hold it in your hands
but like the wind it covers our land
strong enough to rule the heart of many man, this thing called love
it can lift you up, never let you down
take your world and turn it all around
ever since time nothing's ever been found that's stronger than love




most men are like me they struggle and doubt
trouble their minds day in and day out
too busy with living to worry about a little word like love
but when i see a mother's tenderness
as she holds her young close to her breast
then i thank god that the world's been blessed
with a thing called love
