*whistling*


did you ever notice when the sun goes down
out of nowhere, comes a strange and pretty sound?


*whistling*


it's a whistling tune for walking in the night
if you listen, you can hear it in the breeze
'specially when the breeze is drifting through the trees


*whistling*


it's a whistling tune for walking in the night
the murmuring waters sing the song
the echoing mountains hum along
the whispering valleys fill the air
with a whistling tune our hearts can share


it's so wonderful to walk beneath the moon
listening to old mother nature's favorite tune
it's a whistling tune for walking in the night


*whistling*


it's a whistling tune for walking in the night
it's a whistling tune for walking in the night
