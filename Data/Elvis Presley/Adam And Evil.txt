now adam and evil, they go hand in hand
eve taught him sin, that's the way it all began
but every time you kiss me, my heart pounds like a drum
so if trouble is a woman, trouble here i come


i'm lonely like adam, you're evil like eve
i shouldn't take forbidden fruit 'cause i believe
i'll be heading straight for heartache
i should cut loose and run
but if loving you means heartache
heartache, here i come


you're not the angel that i dreamed about
but you're the devil i don't want to live without
a woman's a woman, a man is a man
i can't be free i'm just putty in your hands
who cares about tomorrow, i need your love tonight


and even if you're evil, baby hold me tight
you're not the angel that i dreamed about
but you're the devil i don't want to live without
a woman's a woman, a man is a man
i can't be free i'm just putty in your hands
who cares about tomorrow, i need your love tonight


and baby if you're evil, baby hold me tight
hold me tight
hold me tight
hold me tight
