ain't that loving you baby?
ain't that loving you baby?
ain't that loving you baby?
ain't that loving you so?

i could meet a hundred girls and have loads of fun
my hugging and my kissing belong to just one


ain't that loving you baby?
ain't that loving you baby?
ain't that loving you baby?
ain't that loving you so?

if you gave me nine lives like an alley cat
i'd give them all to you and never take one back


ain't that loving you baby?
ain't that loving you baby?
ain't that loving you baby?
ain't that loving you so?

i'm putting on my sunday suit and i'm going downtown
but i'll be kissing your lips before the sun goes down


ain't that loving you baby?
ain't that loving you baby?
ain't that loving you baby?
ain't that loving you so?


ain't that loving you baby?
ain't that loving you so?
