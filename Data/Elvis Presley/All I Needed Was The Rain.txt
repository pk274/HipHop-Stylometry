hello, misfortune, how's my old friend "mr. misery"?
i've been away so long
i bet you thought you'd seen the last of me


i got no bed to rest my head
no doors or walls or window pane
now all i needed was the rain
rain, rain, rain, rain


met a little honey
at the buzzing bumble bee cafe, yes, i did
one drink and all my money
and that honey bee had flown away


i'm 'bout as low as i can go
i don't really mean to complain
now all i needed was the rain
rain, rain, rain, rain


all i needed was this rain
all i needed was the rain
