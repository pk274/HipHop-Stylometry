uh, well, a-bless my soul
what's wrong with me?
i'm itching like a man on a fuzzy tree
my friends say i'm actin' wild as a bug


i'm in love
i'm all shook up
mm mm oh, oh, yeah, yeah!


well, my hands are shaky and my knees are weak
i can't seem to stand on my own two feet
who do you thank when you have such luck?


i'm in love
i'm all shook up
mm mm oh, oh, yeah, yeah!


well, please don't ask me what's on my mind
i'm a little mixed up, but i feel fine
when i'm near the girl that i love best
my heart beats so it scares me to death!





when she touched my hand, what a chill i got
her lips are like a volcano that's hot
i'm proud to say that she's my buttercup


i'm in love
i'm all shook up
mm mm oh, oh, yeah, yeah!


my tongue gets tied when i try to speak
my insides shake like a leaf on a tree
there's only one cure for this body of mine
that's to have that girl that i love so fine!


she touched my hand, what a chill i got
her lips are like a volcano that's hot
i'm proud to say that she's my buttercup


i'm in love
i'm all shook up
mm mm oh, oh, yeah, yeah!
mm mm oh, oh, yeah, yeah!
i'm all shook up
