all that i am or ever hope to be
lies in your hands
you are my destiny
when you are in my arms, i rule the world
and when we're far apart, how cruel the world


all that i want is to be near to you
to spend my life making it clear to you
you are my heart, my soul, my dream come true
all that i am, i am because of you
all that i want is to be near to you
to spend my life making it clear to you
you are my heart, my soul, my dream come true
all that i am, i am because of you



because of you
because of you
