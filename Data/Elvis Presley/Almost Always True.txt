i was always, baby, i was always
well, almost always true to you
met a pretty mademoiselle
her papa owned a small hotel
oh, i was almost always true to you


i resisted, though my arm was twisted
i was almost always true to you
i stayed away from drinking wine
thought about you all the time
oh, i was almost always true to you


kept refusing, don't jump to conclusions
i was almost always true to you
i would never grab like this
i would never steal a kiss
oh, i was almost always true to you
i was almost always true to you
