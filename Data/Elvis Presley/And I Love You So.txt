and i love you so
the people ask me how
how i've lived 'til now
i tell them i don't know


i guess they understand
how lonely life has been
but life began again
the day you took my hand


and yes, i know how lonely life can be
shadows follow me
and the night won't set me free
but i don't let the evening get me down
now that you're around me


and you love me too
your thoughts are just for me
you set my spirits free
i'm happy that you do


the book of life is brief
once the page is read
all but love is dead
this is my belief


and yes, i know how lonely life can be
shadows follow me
and the night won't set me free
but i don't let the evening get me down
now that you're around me
