angel, with those angel eyes
come and take this earth boy
up to paradise

angel, may i hold you tight?
never kissed an angel
let me kiss one tonight


if i said, "i love you"
would i be speaking out of turn?
i'm only human, but i'm willing to learn

angel, make my wish come true
let me be in heaven
here on earth with you


if i said, "i love you"
would i be speaking out of turn?
i'm only human, but i'm willing to learn

angel, make my wish come true
let me be in heaven
here on earth with you
