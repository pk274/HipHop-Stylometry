don't ever take your eyes off me
not even for a minute
'cause like a panther i might pounce
and there'll be danger in it


i can be sneaky, fast as a snake
i strike like a cobra, make no mistake
and baby, you'll be trapped, quick as a wink
it's animal instinct


don't think that i won't pin you down
no matter how you plead it
i'm like a lion who's been caged
and you're the meat i'm needin'


watch out, i'll warn you, sharp as a hawk
i'm wild as a tiger, i prowl, and i stalk
because when a man feels thirst, he takes a drink
it's animal instinct


you better not be caught off guard
this wolf is on the search now
a leopard just can't change its spots
and i'm about to lurch now
love's like the jungle, i fight tooth and nail
i just gotta get you, you'll fall without fail
i'm ready for the kill, i'm right on the brink
it's animal instinct
it's animal instinct, animal instinct
