i'll be as strong as a mountain
or weak as a willow tree
any  way you want me
well, that's how i will be


i'll be as tame as a baby
or wild as the raging sea
any way you want me
well, that's how i will be


in your hands my heart is clay
to take and hold as you may
i'm what you make me, you've only to take me
and in your arms i will stay


i'll be a fool or a wise man
my darling, you hold the key
yes, any way you want me
well, that's how i will be


i will be
