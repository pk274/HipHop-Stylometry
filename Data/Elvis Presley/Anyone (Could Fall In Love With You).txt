anyone could fall in love with you
anyone who knows you as i do
anyone could fall in love with you
and i love you, my darling


anyone could lose his heart like me
anyone who has eyes that can see
anyone could fall in love like me
and i love you, my darling


you're the star i reached for
you're a dream so rare
you're my greatest treasure
nothing can compare


anyone could want you for his own
anyone, not only mine alone
anyone could fall in love with you
and i love you, my darling
anyone could fall in love with you
and i love you, my darling
