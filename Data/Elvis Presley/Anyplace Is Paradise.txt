whether i'm riding down a highway
or walking down a street
it makes no difference, baby doll
wherever we chance to meet

each time i hold your little hand
it makes me feel so very nice
anyplace is paradise
when i'm with you


whether we're standing on a doorstep
or sitting at a park
or strolling down a shady lane
or dancing in the dark

where i can take you in my arms
and look into your pretty eyes
anyplace is paradise
when i'm with you


give me a cave up in the mountains
or a shack down by the sea
and i will be in heaven, honey
if you are there with me

where i can kiss your pretty lips
see the love light in your eyes
anyplace is paradise
when i'm with you


baby, i'd live deep in the jungle
and sleep up in a tree
and let the rest of the world go by
if you were there with me

where i could love you all the time
baby, the jungle would be fine
anyplace is paradise
when i'm with you
