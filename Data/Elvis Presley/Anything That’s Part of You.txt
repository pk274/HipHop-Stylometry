i memorize the note you sent
go all the places that we went
i seem to search the whole day through
for anything that's part of you


i kept a ribbon from your hair
a breath of perfume lingers there
it helps to cheer me when i'm blue
anything that's part of you


oh, how it hurts to miss you so
when i know you don't love me anymore
to go on needing you
knowing you don't need me


no reason left for me to live
what can i take, what can i give
when i'd give all of someone new
for anything that's part of you
