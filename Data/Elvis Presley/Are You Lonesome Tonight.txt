are you lonesome tonight? do you miss me tonight?
are you sorry we drifted apart?
does your memory stray to a brighter summer day
when i kissed you and called you sweetheart?


do the chairs in your parlor seem empty and bare?
do you gaze at your doorstep and picture me there?
is your heart filled with pain? shall i come back again?
tell me, dear, are you lonesome tonight?


i wonder if you are lonesome tonight
you know someone said that the world's a stage and each must play a part
fate had me playing in love with you as my sweetheart
act one was where we met
i loved you at first glance
you read your lines so cleverly and never missed a cue
then came act two
you seemed to change, you acted strange
and why, i've never known
honey, you lied when you said you loved me
and i had no cause to doubt you
but i'd rather go on hearing your lies
than to go on living without you
now the stage is bare and i'm standing there
with emptiness all around
and if you won't come back to me
then they can bring the curtain down


is your heart filled with pain? shall i come back again?
tell me, dear, are you lonesome tonight?
