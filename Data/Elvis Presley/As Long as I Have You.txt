let the stars fade and fall
and i won't care at all
as long as i have you
every kiss brings a thrill
and i know that it will
as long as i have you


let's think of the future
forget the past
you're not my first love
but you're my last
take the love that i bring
then i'll have everything
as long as i have you


let's think of the future
forget the past
you're not my first love
but you're my last
take the love that i bring
then i'll have everything
as long as i have you


as long, as long as i have you
