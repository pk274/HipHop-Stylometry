ask me if i wanted to caress you
and i'd confess
ask me if i'm longing to possess you
i'll answer yes


now that we're together
i could hold you close forever
and i swear that i would never let you go
there's no question that i care more than you


love me darling, just be mine completely
and there's nothing i won't do if you
just ask me


now that we're together
i could hold you close forever
and i swear that i would never let you go
there's no question that i care more than you


love me darling, just be mine completely
and there's nothing i won't do if you
just ask me
just ask me
