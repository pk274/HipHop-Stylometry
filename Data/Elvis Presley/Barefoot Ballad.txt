i want a barefoot ballad, yes, a barefoot ballad
won't you play for me a down-home country song
'cause when i kick my shoes off and i kick my blues off
with a barefoot ballad, you just can't go wrong


give me a honk-tonk fiddle with a guitar
in the middle of a melody
humming like a fountain
swinging out on smokey mountain


barefoot ballad, yes, a barefoot ballad
won't you play for me a down-home country song
'cause when i kick my shoes off and i kick my blues off
with a barefoot ballad, you just can't go wrong


now the big toe's connected to the two toe
and the two toe's connected to the three toe
and the three toe's connected to the four toe
and the four toe's connected to the five toe
and the five toe (that's a live toe) and away we go


i want a barefoot ballad yes a barefoot ballad
won't you play for me a down-home country song
'cause when i kick my shoes off and i kick my blues off
with a barefoot ballad, you just can't go wrong


now the big toe's connected to the two toe
and the two toe's connected to the three toe
and the three toe's connected to the four toe
and the four toe's connected to the five toe
and the five toe (that's a live toe)
(what's a live toe? that's a jive toe)
(what a jive toe? that's a drive toe) away we go


i want a barefoot ballad, yes, a barefoot ballad
won't you play for me
(play for who? play for him)
(play for her) a barefoot ballad song
