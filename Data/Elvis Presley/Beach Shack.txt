i'll dry your back
come and relax, girl
in my little beach shack

it's a pleasure to welcome you
to my little beach shack


in my beach shack, baby, we'll be alone
in my beach shack, i'll make you feel at home


take off that wet cap
let down your hair
come to my beach shack
you'll be comfortable there
dum-di-dum-di-dum, yeah-yeah-yeah

in my little beach shack

don't be afraid, girl

in my little beach shack
