first time i fell in love
i fell in love with you
first time i dared to dream
my only dream came true


must be beginner's luck
to wish upon a star
that opened up my eyes
and there you are


i wave no magic wand
i own no lucky charms
how then can i explain
an angel in my arms
must be beginner's luck
what else can it be
when someone wonderful as you
loves me
