breeze, sing a happy song
this heart of mine is singing right along
don't know where i'm going, don't know where it ends
feel the grass is greener beyond the bend

i haven't got a care
i'm just on my way to anywhere
pocketful of nothing, nothing i can spend
hope the grass is greener beyond the bend


beyond the bend, perhaps there'll be
somebody waiting who's right for me

so i got to move around
and i know i've got to cover ground
oh, the trip is shorter when you got a friend
gonna find that rainbow beyond the bend

beyond the bend, perhaps there'll be
somebody waiting who's right for me

so i got to move around
and i know i've got to cover ground
oh, the trip is shorter when you got a friend
gonna find that rainbow beyond the bend

beyond the bend
beyond the bend
