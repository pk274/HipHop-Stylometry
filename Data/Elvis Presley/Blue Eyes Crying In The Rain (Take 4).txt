in the twilight glow i see her
blue eyes crying in the rain
when we kissed goodbye and parted
i knew we'd never meet again


love is like a dying ember
only memories remain
through the ages i remember
blue eyes crying in the rain


someday when we meet up yonder
we'll stroll hand in hand again
in a land that knows no parting
blue eyes crying in the rain


blue eyes crying in the rain
blue eyes crying in the rain
blue eyes crying in the rain
blue eyes crying in the rain
blue eyes crying in the rain
