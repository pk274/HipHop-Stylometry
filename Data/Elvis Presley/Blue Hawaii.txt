night and you
and blue hawaii
the night is heavenly
and you are heaven to me


lovely you
and blue hawaii
with all this loveliness
there should be love


come with me
while the moon is on the sea
the night is young
and so are we, so are we


dreams come true
in blue hawaii
and mine could all come true
this magic night of nights with you
