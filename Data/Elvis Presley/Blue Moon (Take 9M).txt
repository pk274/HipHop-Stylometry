blue moon
you saw me standing alone
without a dream in my heart
without a love of my own


blue moon
you knew just what i was there for
you heard me saying a prayer for
someone i really could care for


blue moon
you saw me standing alone
without a dream in my heart
without a love of my own


blue moon
without a love of my own
