blue moon, blue moon, blue moon
keep shining bright
blue moon, keep on shining bright
you're gonna bring me back my baby tonight
blue moon, keep shining bright


i said blue moon of kentucky, keep on shining
shine on the one that's gone and left me blue
i said blue moon of kentucky, keep on shining
shine on the one that's gone and left me blue


well, it was on one moonlight night
stars shining bright
wish blown high
love said goodbye


blue moon of kentucky, keep on shining
shine on the one that's gone and left me blue


well, i said blue moon of kentucky, just keep on shining
shine on the one that's gone and left me blue
i said blue moon of kentucky, keep on shining
shine on the one that's gone and left me blue


well, it was on one moonlight night
stars shining bright
wish blown high
love said goodbye


blue moon of kentucky, keep on shining
shine on the one that's gone and left me blue
