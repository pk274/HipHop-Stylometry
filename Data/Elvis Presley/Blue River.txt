blue river, it can't be found on any map that i know
but it's the place where lonely lovers all go
to cry their tears, blue river
it winds along a path of heartache and pain
of broken dreams from loving someone in vain
like i loved you, and baby i still do
i held you so tight


you were out of my sight
i'm feeling so low
but i got to go
blue river because you never really cared about me
from now on baby that's where i'm going to be
crying over you, by the river of blue
