i worked all day and my feet feel just like lead
you got my shirt tails flying all over the place
and the sweat popping out of my head"

she said, "go, bossa nova baby

i said, "hey little mama, let's sit down
have a drink and dig the band"
she said, "drink, drink, drink oh, fiddle-de-dink
i can dance with a drink in my hand"


she said, "hey bossa nova baby
keep on working for this ain't no time to drink"
she said, "go bossa nova baby
keep on dancing, 'cause i ain't got time to think"

i said, "come on baby, it's hot in here
and it's oh so cool outside
if you lend me a dollar, i can buy some gas
and we can go for a little ride"


she said, "hey bossa nova baby
keep on working for i ain't got time for that"
she said, "go bossa nova baby
keep on dancing or i'll find myself another cat"
