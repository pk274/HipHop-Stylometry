lord almighty
i feel my temperature rising
higher higher
it's burning through to my soul
girl, girl, girl, girl
you're gonna set me on fire
my brain is flaming
i don't know which way to go


your kisses lift me higher
like a sweet song of a choir
you light my morning sky
with burning love


ooh, ooh, ooh
i feel my temperature rising
help me, i'm flaming
i must be a hundred and nine
burning, burning, burning
and nothing can cool me
i just might turn into smoke
but i feel fine


'cause your kisses lift me higher
like a sweet song of a choir
and you light my morning sky
with burning love


it's coming closer
the flames are now licking my body
won't you help me
i feel like i'm slipping away
it's hard to breathe
and my chest is a-heaving
lord, have mercy
i'm burning a hole where i lay


your kisses lift me higher
like the sweet song of a choir
you light my morning sky
with burning love
with burning love
(ah, ah, burning love)


i'm just a hunk, a hunk of burning love
just a hunk, a hunk of burning love
just a hunk, a hunk of burning love
just a hunk, a hunk of burning love
just a hunk, a hunk of burning love
just a hunk, a hunk of burning love
just a hunk, a hunk of burning love
just a hunk, a hunk of burning love
just a hunk, a hunk of burning love
just a hunk, a hunk of burning love
just a hunk, a hunk of burning love
