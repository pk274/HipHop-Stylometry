well children, by and by when the morning comes
all the saints of god, together they come
we will tell the story of how the lord will come
and we'll understand him better by and by

and we cannot understand
all the ways god will lead us
to the blessed promised land
he will guide us with his eye
and we'll follow till we die
and we'll understand him better by and by

often take us unaware
and our hearts are made to bleed
for some thoughtless word or deed
and we wonder why the test
when we try to do our best
but we'll understand it better by and by
