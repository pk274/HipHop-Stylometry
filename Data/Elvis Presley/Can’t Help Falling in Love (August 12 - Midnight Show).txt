wise men say
"only fools, only fools rush in"
but i, but i, i can't help
falling in love with you


shall i stay?
would it be, would it be a sin?
if i, i, i can't help
falling in love with you?


like a river flows
surely to the sea
darling, so it goes
some things, you know, are meant to be


take my, take my hand
take my whole, whole life, too
for i, for i, i can't help
falling in love with you
for i can't help
falling in love with you
