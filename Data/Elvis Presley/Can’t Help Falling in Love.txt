wise men say
"only fools rush in"
but i can't help
falling in love with you


shall i stay?
would it be a sin
if i can't help
falling in love with you?


like a river flows
surely to the sea
darling, so it goes
some things are meant to be


take my hand
take my whole life, too
for i can't help
falling in love with you

take my hand
take my whole life, too
