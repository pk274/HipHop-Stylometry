aha-ha hurry, hurry, step this way
aha-ha hurry, hurry, step this way


now the show you're gonna see is strictly high class
there'll be ten hula dancers shaking their grass
so step right up and put your money down
this way to carny town


we got a man so skinny you can see his bones
we play on his ribs like a xylophone
with a pair of spoons, we get a rockin' song
you'll hear it all in carny town


hurry, hurry, hurry, the house is almost full
we got a two headed cow and that's no bull


there's a man who swallows swords and he never gets hurt
he eats razor blades for dessert
he's just about the sharpest guy around
you'll see him here in carny town


aha-ha hurry, hurry, step this way
aha-ha hurry, hurry, step this way
aha-ha hurry, hurry, step this way
aha-ha hurry, hurry, step this way
aha-ha, i say we're gonna win
i said hurry up
