won't you show me how to kiss?
put your lips on mine
do you do it just like this?
tell me i'm doing fine

we got a good thing going, now take your time
come on and make it last
love may be new to you, but, ooh
i'm catching on fast


give, give, give me all you've got to give
love, love, love every moment you live


now you've taught me all you know
have i passed the test?
show me all you've got to show
baby, you're the best

but tell me i've learned quickly, and i know each trick
i'm sure love's going to last
love maybe new to you, but, ooh
i'm catching on fast
