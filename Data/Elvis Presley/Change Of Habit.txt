if you're in old habits
set in your old ways
changes are a-coming
for these are changing days


and if your head is in the sand
while things are going on
what you need, what you need
what you need is a change of habit


now if you're in the habit
to let your temper fly
when you talk with people
who don't see eye to eye


and if you don't believe it
there's a newer world ahead
what you need, what you need
what you need is a change of habit


a change of habit, a change of outlook
a change of heart, you'll be alright
the halls of darkness, have doors that open
it's never too late to see the light


so if you're in the habit
putting people down
just because they're different
from the wrong side of town


well, don't count on any medals, son
they're pinning none on you
what you need, what you need
what you need is a change of habit









change of habit, hmm, change of habit
change of habit
