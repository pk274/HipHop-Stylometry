what's in the drink, chase the devil away
magic i think so i just say chesay
chesay, chesay bring you good luck night and day
chesay, chesay that's the gypsy way


trouble is my middle name
though it's such a crying shame
try and try there's nothing i can do
but i'm feeling kinda strange
feel like things are going to change


time my lucky star was shining through
chesay, chesay bring you good luck night and day
chesay, chesay that's the gypsy way


drink a cup of gypsy love
just tip it up and then you just say chesay
swallow once then swallow twice
goes down so nice just say chesay, hey


what's in the drink, chase the devil away
magic i think so i just say chesay
chesay, chesay bring you good luck night and day
chesay, chesay that's the gypsy way


chesay, chesay brings you good luck night and day
chesay, chesay that's the gypsy way
chesay, chesay brings you good luck night and day
chesay, chesay that's the gypsy way
chesay
