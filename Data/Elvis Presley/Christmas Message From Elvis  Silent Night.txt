thank you for listening. i like to wish you a merry christmas and a wonderful new year

silent night, holy night
all is calm, all is bright
'round yon virgin mother and child
holy infant so tender and mild
sleep in heavenly peace
sleep in heavenly peace

silent night, holy night
shepherds quake at the sight
glorious streams from heaven afar
heavenly host sing alleluia
christ the savior is born
christ the savior is born
