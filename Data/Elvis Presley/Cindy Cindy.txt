wish i was an apple dangling from a tree
every time you'd pass me by, you'd take a bite of me
i wish i was a bluebird, i'd never fly away
i'd sit up on your shoulder, baby, and sing to you all day


come on home, cindy, cindy
come on home, cindy, cindy
come on home, cindy, cindy
come on home to me


i wrote it in a letter, carved it on a tree
told it to a honeycomb, told it to a bee
told them that i love you, they all know it's true
say it 'til the cows come home, until it gets to you


come on home, cindy, cindy
come on home, cindy, cindy
come on home, cindy, cindy
come on home to me


need you in the morning to start the coffee pot
need you in the afternoon to fan me when i'm hot
need you in the evening when supper time is through
what i'm really trying to say is i can't get enough of you


come on home, cindy, cindy
come on home, cindy, cindy
come on home, cindy, cindy
come on home to me


if i were a musician, i'd harp on just one thing
you should never play my harp the way you pluck a string
if only you would love me, sincerely tell me so
i'd beat two drums about it, baby, to have the whole world know


come on home, cindy, cindy
come on home, cindy, cindy
come on home, cindy, cindy
come on home to me

come on home, cindy, cindy
come on home, cindy, cindy
come on home, cindy, cindy
come on home to me

come on home, cindy, cindy
come on home, cindy, cindy
come on home, cindy, cindy
come on home to me
