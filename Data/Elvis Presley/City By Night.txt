when shadows beckon on dim-lit avenues
night people hear the call
from hidden alleys, and secret rendezvous
they come out one and all


the city by night eyes wide awake
it never sleeps make no mistake


whatever sets off the spark
a magic glow lights the dark
then i'm intrigued by the sight
of the city by night

those crowded nightclubs
those picturesque cafes
are scenes no-one forgets
and i'm enchanted, music softly plays
by dancing silhouettes


the city by night eyes wide awake
it never sleeps make no mistake


the evening's full of surprise
it's magic opens my eyes
and i'm intrigued by the sight
of the city by night


yeah!
