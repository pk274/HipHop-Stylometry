hey, listen world you've got to know
i'm cutting loose and letting go
who needs the worry and the strife
life can be a ball now just following my life



look for the brightest lights in town
that's where you'll find me hanging round
i've got this feeling to be free
i pick and choose the life i want and that's the life for me





all right
