sandman's comin', yes, he's comin'
to sprinkle you with sand
he'll say, "one, two, three", and you will be
in cotton candy land

sandman's comin', yes, he's comin'
he'll take you by the hand
and you'll ride upon a big white swan
in cotton candy land


you and the swan will float upon
a cloud of pink ice cream
where every star is a candy bar
and the moon is a marshmallow dream


sandman's comin', yes, he's comin'
take his magic hand
and now, goodnight, and now sleep tight
in cotton candy land
in cotton candy land
