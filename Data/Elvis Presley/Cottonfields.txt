my mother would rock me in the cradle
in them old, old cotton fields at home
when i was a little baby
my mother would rock me in the cradle
in them old, old cotton fields at home


oh, when them cotton balls get rotten
you couldn't pick very much cotton
in them old cotton fields at home
it was down in louisiana
just a mile from texarkana
in them old, old cotton fields at home


it may sound a little funny
but, you didn't make very much money
in them old cotton fields at home

just a mile from texarkana

i was over in arkansas
people ask me, "what you come here for?"
