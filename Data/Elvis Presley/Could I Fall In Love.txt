could i fall in love for the very first time
that's what i ask myself when you're lips touch mine
could i fall in love on a night like tonight
that's what i'd like to know when i hold you tight


now that we're alone (now that we're alone)
just a kiss apart (just a kiss apart)
i have the answer from the feeling in my heart
could i fall in love and forever be true
my heart tells me i could if i fell for you
