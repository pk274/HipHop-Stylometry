never know how much i love you
never knew how much i care
when you put your arms around me
i get a fever that's so hard to bear


you give me fever when you kiss me (crawfish)
fever when you hold me tight (crawfish)
fever in the morning (crawfish)
fever all through the night (fever)


sun lights up the daytime
moon lights up the night
i light up when you call my name
and you know i'm going to treat you right


you give me fever when you kiss mе (crawfish)
fever when you hold mе tight (crawfish)
fever in the morning (crawfish)
fever all through the night (fever)


everybody's got the fever
that is something you all know
fever isn't such a new thing
fever started long ago


romeo loved juliet
juliet she felt the same
when he put his arms around her, he said
julie baby, you're my flame
thou giveth fever
when we kisseth
fever with thy flaming youth
fever, i'm afire
fever, yeah i burn, forsooth


oh, when we kiss, my heart's on fire
burning with a strange desire
and i know, each time i kiss you
that your heart's on fire too


(crawfish) when we kiss you
fever if you live you learn (crawfish)
fever, 'til you sizzle (crawfish)
oh, what a lovely way to burn (fever)
oh, what a lovely way to burn
what a lovely way to burn
what a lovely way to burn
