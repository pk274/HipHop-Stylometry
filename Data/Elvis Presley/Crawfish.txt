crawfish (crawfish)
well, i went to the bayou just last night
there was no moon, but the stars were bright
put a big long hook on a big long pole
and i pulled mr. crawfish out of his hole


crawfish (crawfish)
see i got him, see the size
stripped and cleaned before your eyes
sweet meat, look
fresh and ready to be cook


crawfish (crawfish)
now take mr. crawfish in your hand
he's gonna look good in your frying pan
if you fry him crisp or you boil him right
he'll be sweeter than sugar when you take a bite
