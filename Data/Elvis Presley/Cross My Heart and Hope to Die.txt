i can explain about last night
though things didn't look just right
please believe me there was nothing wrong
i thought about you baby all night long
cross my heart, i hope to die
well, i wouldn't tell you no lie


talk about a piece of rotten luck
you do a friend a favor and you wind up stuck
she couldn't hold a candle to you, no siree
very hard to handle like a model t
cross my heart, i hope to die
well, i wouldn't tell you no lie


please believe me when i say
wild horses couldn't drag me away
from you because i don't have to look too hard
to see what i've got in my own back yard
so, please forgive me and forget


don't say my alloy's all wet
i miss those kisses from your honeycomb
this humble bumble bee just wants to fly back home
cross my heart, i hope to die
well, i wouldn't tell you no lie


i wouldn't tell you no lie
no, no, no, no, no, no
i wouldn't tell you no lie
