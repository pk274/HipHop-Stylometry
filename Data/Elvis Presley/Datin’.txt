dating is a game that grownups play
dating means acting in a silly way
dating makes girls start wiggle walking
dating makes a guy start baby talking

dizzy like children on a merry-go-round
grownups are the biggest kids i've found


you'd think they belonged in a baby carriage
they're doing things that lead to marriage
but don't you laugh at what they do, oh no
cause some day you'll be dating too


dating makes a guy comb his hair just right
his girl can mess it up when they kiss good-night
dating makes you quarrel and say you'll break up
and just because it's so much fun to make up

children can't wait to grow up but then
they're dating and they're acting like kids again


you'd think they belonged in a baby carriage
they're doing things that lead to marriage
but don't you laugh at what they do, oh no
some day you'll be dating too
