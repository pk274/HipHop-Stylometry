i've got a dirty, dirty feelin'
dirty dealings goin' on
you know i almost hit the ceilin'
when i woke up and you were gone


i took you in when you were hungry
and now you're cuttin' out on me
i'm gonna help you, little darlin'
that ain't the way it's gonna be

i hear you're pretty good at runnin'
but pretty soon you'll slip and fall
that's when i'll drag you home with me, girl
i'm gonna chain you to the wall (yeah)


i've got a dirty, dirty feelin'
dirty dealings goin' on
you know i almost hit the ceilin'
when i woke up, and you were gone (gone)
