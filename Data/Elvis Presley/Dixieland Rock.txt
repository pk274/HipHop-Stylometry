well, down in new orleans at the golden goose
i grabbed a green-eyed dolly that was on the loose
well, i dig that music, well she said, "me too"
i said, "pretty baby come on and let's do"


the dixieland rock (dixieland rock)
well, the dixieland rock (dixieland rock)
let your hair down sugar, shake it free
and do the dixieland rock with me


with the blue light shining on her swinging hips
she got the drummer so nervous that he lost his sticks
the cornet player hit a note that's flat
the trombone hit him while the poor cat sat


to the dixieland rock (dixieland rock)
well, the dixieland rock (dixieland rock)
let your hair down sugar, shake it free
and do the dixieland rock with me


i was all pooped out and when the clock struck four
but she said, no daddy can't leave the floor
she wore a clinging dress that fit so tight
she couldn't sit down so we danced all night


to the dixieland rock (dixieland rock)
well, the dixieland rock (dixieland rock)
let your hair down sugar, shake it free
and do the dixieland rock with me

let your hair dance sugar, shake it free
and do the dixieland rock with me
(dixieland, dixieland)
(dixieland rock with me)
