do you know who i am?
have you had any idea who i am?
yes, it's been quite a while
and it's so good to see you again


it's so dark in this place
that i can't see your face
may we leave?
oh i see
does he know who i am
and what once was between you and me?


do you know how i tried?
have you any idea how i tried
not to keep you inside
do you know darling how much i cried?

i remember you said
that you had to forget about me, and be free
do you know who i am or have you forgot about me?


do you think there's a chance
you and i could start over anew
is there a prayer you still care
or has it just been too long and we're through?
well, what about you and him?
oh he's only a friend
well i see there's still a chance for me


well maybe some other time, in some other place
with our love in your heart and a smile on your face
you will know who i am
when that time comes you'll know who i am
you will know who i am
when that time comes you'll know who i am
you will know who i am
when that time comes you'll know who i am
