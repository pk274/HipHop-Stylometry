hey everybody gather round
and listen to that bongo sound
grab the first one in your reach
now we're going to shake the beach


do the clam, do the clam
grab your barefoot baby by the hand
turn and tease, hug and squeeze
dig right in and do the clam


you can get your heart to spin
on the outside looking in
the moon ain't going to last all night
let's work up an appetite




everybody's got that beat
well, listen to those happy feet
ain't you glad that you found out
what the clam is all about
