i gave my heart
i gave my love
oh ho, my darling
i am true
doing the best
the best i can (the best i can)
but it's not good
enough for you


i tried so hard
so hard to please
oh ho, my darling
what more can i do
doing the best
the best i can (the best i can)
but it's not good
enough for you (for you)


you know i was the kind who'd run
any time you'd call
i guess i was the only one
who didn't mind at all


i'll be a dreamer
i'll be a fool
oh ho, my darling
my whole life through
doing the best
the best i can (the best i can)
but it's not good
enough for you (for you)
