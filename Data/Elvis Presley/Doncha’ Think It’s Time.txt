i've been yearnin' for a little romance
i want to know when you're gonna give me a chance
love me honey, tell me you're mine
doncha' think it's time

i've been yearning for a sweet embrace
rub my hair till i'm a total disgrace
kiss me honey make me feel so fine
doncha' think it's time


i don't wanna walk without you
walking right by my side
it hurts me to see you talkin'
with the other guy


i get so warm when you touch my cheek
you thrill me so much that i can hardly speak
love me honey, when you feel so fine
doncha' think it's time


i don't wanna walk without you
walking right by my side
it hurts me to see you talkin'
to any other guy


i get so warm when you touch my cheek
you thrill me so much that i can hardly speak
kiss me honey, make me feel so fine
doncha' think it's time
doncha' think it's time
doncha' think it's time
doncha' think it's time
