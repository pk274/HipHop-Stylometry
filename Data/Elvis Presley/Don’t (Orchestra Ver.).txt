don't, don't, that's what you say
each time that i hold you this way
when i feel like this and i want to kiss you
baby, don't say don't
don't don't


don't, don't leave my embrace
for here in my arms is your place
when the night grows cold and i want to hold you
baby, don't say don't
don't don't don't


if you think that this is just a game
i'm playing
if you think that i don't mean
every word i'm saying
don't, don't, don't, don't
don't feel that way
i'm your love and yours i will stay


this you can believe
i will never leave you
heaven knows i won't
baby, don't say don't
don't please don't
