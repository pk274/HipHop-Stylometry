you know i can be found
sitting home all alone
if you can't come around
at least please telephone


don't be cruel to a heart that's true


baby, if i made you mad
for something i might have said
please, let's forget my past
the future looks bright ahead


don't be cruel to a heart that's true


don't stop thinking of me
don't make me feel this way
c'mon over here and love me
you know what i want you to say


don't be cruel to a heart that's true


let's walk up to the preacher
and let us say "i do"
then you'll know you'll have me
and i'll know that i'll have you


don't be cruel to a heart that's true


don't be cruel to a heart that's true
don't be cruel to a heart that's true
