don't leave me now (don't leave me now)
now that i need you (ooh)
how blue and lonely i'd be
if you should say we're through (don't say we're through)


don't break my heart (don't break my heart)
this heart that loves you (ooh)
there'd just be nothing for me
if you should leave me now (don't leave me now)


what good is dreaming
if i must dream all alone by myself
without you, darling? (darling)
my arms would gather dust
like a book on a shelf


come to these arms (come to these arms)
these arms that need you (ooh)
don't close your eyes to my plea
don't leave me now (don't leave me now)
don't close your eyes to my plea
don't you leave me now (don't leave me now)
