some guys fall in love with one girl, i got to fall for two
there's just so much loving that one heart's supposed to do
so i go around with my heart dragging on the ground
dogging me around, i'm the sorriest sight in town


i got double trouble, i got double trouble
i got double trouble twice as much as anybody else, oh yeah


i guess there's got to be two dark clouds hanging over me
my future looks a bumpy as a matchbox on the sea
every time i think that i have finally got it made
some losing cards are played, i just can't make the grade
