drums of the islands, you're beating in my heart
you're with me no matter where i roam
if ever i wander, if ever we're apart
i know that you will lead me home


if i should journey across the deep blue sea
i'll never forget these coral shores
drums of the islands, i hear you calling me
and i'll return forever yours


i love each valley, each grain of sand, each hill
the flowers, the music of the isles
these are the things i love and always will
though i may roam ten thousand miles
