in the early mornin' rain
with a dollar in my hand
and an achin' in my heart
and my pockets full of sand
i'm a long ways from home
and i miss my loved ones so
in the early mornin' rain
with no place to go


out on runway number nine
big 707 set to go
but i'm out here on the grass
where the pavement never grows
where the liquor tasted good
and the women all were fast
there she goes my friend
she's rollin' out at last


hear the mighty engines roar (hear the mighty engines roar )
see the silver wing on high (see the silver wing on high )
she's away and westward bound
far above the clouds she'll fly
where the mornin' rain don't fall
and the sun always shines
she'll be flyin' over my home
in about three hours time


this old airport's got me down
it's no earthly good to me
'cause i'm stuck here on the ground
cold and drunk as i might be
can't jump a jet plane (can't jump a plane)
like you can a freight train (like a freight train )
so i best be on my way
in the early mornin' rain


so i best be on my way
in the early mornin' rain
so i best be on my way
in the early mornin' rain
