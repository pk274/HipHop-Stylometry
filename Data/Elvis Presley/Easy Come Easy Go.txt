easy come, easy go
here, there, everywhere
crazy love is in the air
nightfall, mm, day and nightfall

so many girls in every port
you got to be a juggernaut
full speed ahead or you'll be caught
oh yeah, oh yeah


easy come, easy go
up, down, all around, kiss and kiss
and pound for pound, delicious
mm, so nutritious


when you want love to keep you warm
there's nothing like a uniform
you got a port in any storm
there she blows




easy come, easy go
easy come, easy go
easy come, easy go
