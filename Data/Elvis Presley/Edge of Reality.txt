i walk along a thin line, darling
dark shadows follow me
here's where life's dream lies disillusioned
the edge of reality


oh, i can hear strange voices echo
laughing with mockery
the border line of doom i'm facing
the edge of reality


on the edge of reality, she sits there tormenting me
the girl with the nameless name
on the edge of reality, where she overpowers me
with fears that i can't explain


she drove me to the point of madness
the brink of misery
if she's not real, then i'm condemned to
the edge of reality


on the edge of reality, she sits there tormenting me
the girl with the nameless name
on the edge of reality, where she overpowers me
with fears that i can't explain


she drove me to the point of madness
the brink of misery
if she's not real, then i'm condemned to
the edge of reality


(reality) reality
(reality) reality
(reality) reality...
