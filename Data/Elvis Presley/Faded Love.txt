as i read the letters that you wrote to me
well it's you, it's you that i'm thinking of
as i read the lines that to me were so sweet
i remember our faded love


i miss you darling more and more everyday
as heaven would miss the stars above
with every heartbeat, i still think of you
and remember our faded love


as i think of the past, all the pleasures that we had
as i watch the mating of the doves
it was in the springtime that you said goodbye
i remember our faded love
