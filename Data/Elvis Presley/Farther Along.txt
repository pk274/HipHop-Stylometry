tempted and tried we're oft' made to wonder
why it should be thus all the day long
while there are others living about us
never molested, though in the wrong


farther along, we'll know more about it
farther along, we'll understand why
cheer up, my brother, live in the sunshine
we'll understand it all by and by


when death has come and taken our loved ones
leaving our homes so lonely and drear
then do we wonder how others prosper
living so wicked year after year


farther along, we'll know more about it
farther along, we'll understand why
cheer up, my brother, live in the sunshine
we'll understand it all by and by
