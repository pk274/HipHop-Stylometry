never know how much i love you
never knew how much i care
when you put your arms around me
i get a fever that's so hard to bear


you give me fever when you kiss me
fever when you hold me tight
fever in the morning
fever all through the night


sun lights up the daytime
moon lights up the night
i light up when you call my name
and you know i'm gonna treat you right


you give me fever when you kiss me
fever when you hold me tight
fever in the morning
fever all through the night

everybody's got the fever
that is something you all know
fever isn't such a new thing
fever started long ago


romeo loved juliet
juliet she felt the same
when he put his arms around her
he said 'julie, baby, you're my flame

thou givest fever when we kisseth
fever with thy flaming youth
fever i'm on fire
fever, yeah, i burn forsooth

captain smith and pocahontas
had a very mad affair
when her daddy tried to kill him
she said 'daddy-o, don't you dare

he give me fever with his kisses
fever when he holds me tight
fever, i'm his misses
oh daddy, won't you treat him right'


now you've listened to my story
here's the point that i have made
cats were born to give chicks fever
be it fahrenheit or centigrade

they give you fever when we kiss you
fever if you live and learn
fever till you sizzle
what a lovely way to burn
what a lovely way to burn
what a lovely way to burn
