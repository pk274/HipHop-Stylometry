finders, keepers, losers, weepers
i won't weep and i won't moan
because i found you and your love so true
and i'm keeping you for my own

heads i win or tails i lose
i bet my heart to win your love
the day you kissed me, good luck was with me
and i thank my lucky stars above


i'm not the kind to play for fun
i only play for keeps and i'm keeping all the love i won
finders, keepers, losers, weepers
the loser has to pay the score
he lost you and i found you
and i'm keeping you for ever more


i'm not the kind to play for fun

finders, keepers, losers, weepers
the loser has to pay the score
he lost you and i found you
and i'm keeping you for ever more
he lost you and i found you
and i'm keeping you for ever more
yeah he lost you and i found you
and i'm keeping you for ever more
he lost you and i found you
and i'm keeping you for ever more
