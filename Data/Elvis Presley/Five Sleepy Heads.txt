there were five sleepyheads
all tucked into their beds
while i sang a lullaby
one got dream dust in her eye


there were four sleepyheads
playing possum with me
mr. sandman came by
and then there were three


moonbeams play peek-a-boo
three away became two
and my song was almost done
when the land of nod took one


kissed the last one good night
then i heard not a peep
there were five sleepyheads
now they're all fast asleep
