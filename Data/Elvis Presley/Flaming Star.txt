every man has a flaming star
a flaming star over his shoulder
and when a man sees his flaming star
he knows his time, his time has come


flaming star, don't shine on me, flaming star
flaming star, keep behind me, flaming star
there's a lot of living i've gotta do
give me time to make a few dreams come true
flaming star (flaming star)


when i ride, i feel that flaming star
that flaming star over my shoulder
and so i ride front of that flaming star
never looking around, never looking around


flaming star, don't shine on me, flaming star
flaming star, keep behind me, flaming star
there's a lot of living i've gotta do
give me time to make a few dreams come true
flaming star (flaming star)


one fine day, i'll see that flaming star
that flaming star over my shoulder
and when i see that old flaming star
i'll know my time, my time has come


flaming star, don't shine on me, flaming star
flaming star, keep behind me, flaming star
there's a lot of living i've gotta do
give me time to make a few dreams come true
flaming star
