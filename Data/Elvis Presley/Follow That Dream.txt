(follow that dream, i've got to follow)
(keep a-moving, move along, keep a moving)
i've gotta follow that dream wherever that dream may lead
i gotta follow that dream to find the love i need

when your heart gets restless, time to move along
when your heart gets weary, time to sing a song
but when a dream is calling you
there's just one thing that you can do


well, you gotta follow that dream wherever that dream may lead
you gotta follow that dream to find the love you need

keep a-moving, move along, keep a moving


gotta find me someone whose heart is free
someone to look for my dream with me
and when i find her, i may find out
just what my dreams are all about


i've gotta follow that dream wherever that dream may lead
i gotta follow that dream to find the love i need
i've gotta follow that dream wherever that dream may lead
i gotta follow that dream to find the love i need


keep a-moving, move along
keep a-moving, move along
keep a-moving, move along
