fools rush in
where angels fear to tread
and so i come to you my love
my heart above my head

though i see the danger there
if there's a chance for me
then i don't care
oh, oh, oh, oh


fools rush in
where wise men never go
but wise men never fall in love
so how are they to know


when we met
i felt my life begin
so open up your heart and let
this fool rush in

and i don't care
oh, oh, oh, oh
