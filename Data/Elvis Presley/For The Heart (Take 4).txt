had a dream about you baby, had a dream about me and you
had a dream and woke up crying
well i can roll but i just can't rock
and the time's going by, tick-tock
for the heart, i just can't love no-one but you


well i'm high and dry and lonely, i'm as lonely as can be
and i stare out of my window
well i can play but i just can't win
and the weather's looking dim
for the heart i just can't love no-one but you


for the heart
for the heart
for the heart i just can't love no-one but you

for the heart
for the heart
for the heart i just can't love no-one but you


had a dream about you baby, had a dream about me and you
had a dream and woke up crying
well i can roll but i just can't rock
and the time's going by, tick-tock
for the heart, i just can't love no-one but you


for the heart
for the heart
for the heart i just can't love no-one but you


for the heart
for the heart
for the heart i just can't love no-one but you
well, for the heart
for the heart
for the heart i just can't love no-one but you
yes, for the heart
for the heart
for the heart i just can't love no-one but you
