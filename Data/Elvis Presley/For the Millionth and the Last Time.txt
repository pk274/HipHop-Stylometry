for the millionth and the last time
darling, let me hold you tight
one more kiss, and then i promise
i will say my last goodnight


though your lips are so inviting
and i know i'll wanna stay
give me one more kiss to dream on
and i'll be on my way


it seems a million or so kisses ago
we said goodnight at your door
i didn't get far 'cause here we are
and i'm still begging for more


while the millionth and the last star
slowly disappears from sight
for the millionth and the last time
let me kiss you goodnight


it seems a million or so kisses ago
we said goodnight at your door
i didn't get far 'cause here we are
and i'm still begging for more


while the millionth and the last star
slowly disappears from sight
for the millionth and the last time
let me kiss you goodnight


let me kiss you goodnight
let me kiss you goodnight
