is this train the frankfort special?
now ain't this outfit something special?
well, we heard rumors from the bases
frankfort girls got pretty faces


go, special, go
blow, whistle, blow
frankfort special's got a special way to go
whoa (whoa)


now when we get to our headquarters
we'll be good boys and follow orders
now don't take girls from one another
no, no, no, no, no
we'll treat a sailor like a brother


go, special, go
blow, whistle, blow
frankfort special's got a special way to go
whoa (whoa)


round wheels singing on a long flat track
boiler busting to blow its stack
towns and villages flying by
farewell, fraulein, don't you cry
you'll soon get another g.i

come on, train, and get the lead out
well, one more day we gotta sweat out
frantic frauleins at the station
they're ready for a celebration


go, special, go
blow, whistle, blow
frankfort special's got a special way to go
whoa (whoa)

go, special, go
blow, whistle, blow
frankfort special's got a special way to go
whoa (whoa)


come on, train, and get the lead out

whoa (whoa)
whoa (whoa)
whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
whoa, whoa, whoa
