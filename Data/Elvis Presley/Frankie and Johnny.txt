frankie and me, we were lovers
oh lordy how we did love
swore we'd be true to each other
just as true as stars above
i was her man, she caught me doing her wrong


my luck in poker was fading
when a new gal caught my eye
i gambled, i tried to change my luck
with a chick named nellie bly
i was frankie's man but i was doing her wrong


yeah! frankie came looking to find me
yes, she wasn't looking for fun
for in her sweet loving hand
she was toting' a .44 gun
to shoot her man if he was doing' her wrong


well frankie looked into the bar room
and right there in front of her eyes
there was her loving johnny
making love to that nellie bly
i was her man, she caught me doing her wrong


frankie, i beg, please don't shoot me
well they'll put you away in a cell
you know they'll put you where the cold wind blows
from the hottest corner of hell
i'm your man, i know i done you wrong


easy roll me over, real easy
easy roll me over, real slow
roll me over real gently
cause my wound hurts me so
well i was her man
well i done her wrong


well frankie told johnny
well this is the end of my song
i was her man, well i done her wrong
well , hey, hey, hey, hey, hey
done her wrong
