girl happy, yes, i'm girl happy
girl happy, can't you see?


every girl i see looks good to me
what a crazy way-out way to be
i love a life of nothing but beautiful women
well i'm girl happy, yes, i'm girl happy
girl happy, can't you see?


every time i see a pretty face
my heart just heads for outer space
i need a girl to make my life worth living
yes, i'm girl happy, yes, i'm girl happy
girl happy, can't you see?


i've been like this since i was just a baby boy
first nurse that ever rocked my cradle made me jump for joy
mama, keep your daughter out of sight
i'm in a loving mood tonight
i love a life of nothing but beautiful women
well, i'm girl happy, yes, i'm girl happy
girl happy, can't you see?


i've been like this since i was just a baby boy
first nurse that ever rocked my cradle made me jump for joy
girl happy, well, i'm girl happy
yes, i'm girl happy, can't you see?
girl happy, said i'm girl happy
yes, i'm girl happy, can't you see?
