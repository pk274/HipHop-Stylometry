the girl next door went a-walking
she found the boy she likes
she wanted to get married
settle down for life


the girl next door went a-walking
she knew it wasn't right
she came home half past ten
late every night


the girl next door went a-walking
she found the boy she likes
she wanted to get married
settle down for life


she didn't know love was so grand
she never took love second hand
but to my surprise
she thought that love was paradise


the girl next door went a-walking
she found the boy she likes
she wanted to get married
settle down for life


the girl next door went a-walking
she knew it wasn't right
she came home half past ten
late every night


the girl next door went a-walking
she found the boy she likes
she wanted to get married
settle down for life


she didn't know love was so grand
she never took love second hand
but to my surprise
she thought that love was paradise


the girl next door went a-walking
she found the boy she likes
she wanted to get married
settle down for life


now the two are married
settled down for life
she walks by him hand in hand
late every night


the girl next door went a-walking
she found the boy she likes
she wanted to get married
settle down for life
settle down for life
settle down for life
settle down for life
