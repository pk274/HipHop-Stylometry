give me the right
to hold you tonight
the tears that i've cried over you
give me the right


you can't say no
when i need you so
i want you back in my arms
give me the right


if you looked deep in your heart
like i looked into mine
you'll find that nothing has changed
our love was there all the time


why make me plead
for something you need?
i want to bring back the thrill
give me the right


why make me plead
for something you need?
i want to bring back the thrill
give me the right
