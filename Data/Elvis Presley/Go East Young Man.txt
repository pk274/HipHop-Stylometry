go east young man, go east young man
you'll feel like a sheik, so rich and grand
with dancing girls at your command
go eat and drink and feast, go east young man


i'm going to go where the night's enchanted
go where those dreams are granted
when paradise starts calling, into some tent i'm crawling

i hear those desert drums, and when nighttime comes
then i'll make love the way i planned
to say the least, go on, go east young man




go eat and drink and feast, go east young man
