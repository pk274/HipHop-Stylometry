hear that old train whistle
howling in the night
if that flyer's southbound
things will be all right

i'm leaving now, leaving now, leaving now
i'm gonna get back home somehow


don't nobody tell me
baby's been untrue
if she's been unfaithful
i don't know what i'll do

i'm leaving now, leaving now, leaving now
i'm gonna get back home somehow


never thought that i could miss her so
i never thought i could, but now i know


that the sound of the old train whistle
makes me want to cry
reminds me of that lonely feeling
when i said goodbye

i'm leaving now, leaving now, leaving now
i'm gonna get back home somehow


never thought that i could miss her so
i never thought i could, but now i know


that the sound of the old train whistle
makes me want to cry
reminds me of that lonely feeling
when i said goodbye

i'm leaving now, leaving now, leaving now
i'm gonna get back home somehow
