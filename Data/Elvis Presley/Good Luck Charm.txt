don't want a four leaf clover
don't want an old horse shoe
want your kiss, 'cause i just can't miss
with a good luck charm like you


come on and be my little good luck charm
uh-huh huh, you sweet delight
i want a good luck charm, a-hanging on my arm
to have, to have, to hold, to hold tonight


don't want a silver dollar
rabbit's foot on a string
the happiness in your warm caress
no rabbit's foot can bring


come on and be my little good luck charm
uh-huh huh, you sweet delight
i want a good luck charm, a-hanging on my arm
to have, to have, to hold, to hold tonight

uh-huh huh (uh-huh huh)
uh-huh huh (uh-huh huh)
uh-huh huh (uh-huh huh)
oh yeah

uh-huh huh (uh-huh huh)
uh-huh huh (uh-huh huh)
uh-huh huh (uh-huh huh)
tonight


if i found a lucky penny
i'd toss it across the bay
your love is worth all the gold on earth
no wonder that i say


come on and be my little good luck charm
uh-huh huh, you sweet delight
i want a good luck charm, a-hanging on my arm
to have, to have, to hold, to hold tonight

uh-huh huh (uh-huh huh)
uh-huh huh (uh-huh huh)
uh-huh huh (uh-huh huh)
oh yeah

uh-huh huh (uh-huh huh)
uh-huh huh (uh-huh huh)
uh-huh huh (uh-huh huh)
tonight
