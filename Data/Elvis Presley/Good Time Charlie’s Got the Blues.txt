everybody's gone away
said they're movin to l.a
there's not a soul i know around
everybody's leavin' town


some caught a freight, some caught a plane
found the sunshine, leave the rain
they said this town will waste their time
i guess they're right, it's wasting mine


some gotta win, some gotta lose
good time charlie's got the blues
good time charlie's got the blues


you know my heart keeps tellin' me
you're not a kid at thirty-three
play around, you'll lose your wife
you play it too long you'll lose your life
