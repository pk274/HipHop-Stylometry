oh yes, i've got a lot of living to do
a whole lot of loving to do
come on, baby, to make a party takes two
oh yes i've got a lot of living to do
whole lot of loving to do
well, there's no one who i'd rather do it with-a than you


there's a moon that's big and bright
in the milky way tonight
but the way you act, you never would know it's there
now baby, time's a-wasting
a lot of kisses i am not been tasting
i don't know about you, but i'm going to get my share


i got a lot of living to do
whole lot of loving to do
come on, baby, to make a party takes two
oh yes, i've got a lot of living to do
whole lot of loving to do
well, there's no one who i'd rather do it with-a than you


there's a balmy little breeze
that's a-whistling through the trees
and it's telling you to pitch a little woo with me
why don't you take a listen
you'll never know what you've been missing
cuddle up real close and be my little honey bee


got a lot of living to do
got a lotta loving to do
come on, baby, to make a party takes two
oh yes, i've got a lot of living to do
whole lotta loving to do
well, there's no one who i'd rather do it with-a than you


you're the prettiest thing i've seen
but you treat me so doggone mean
ain't you got no heart, i'm dying to hold you near
why do you keep me waiting?
why don't you start cooperating?
and the things i say, the things you want to hear


i got a lot of living to do
i got a lotta loving to do
come on, baby, to make a party takes two
oh yes, i've got a lot of living to do
got a lotta loving to do
well, there's no one who i'd rather do it with-a than you
there's no one who i'd rather do it with-a than you
well, there's no one who i'd rather do it with-a than you
