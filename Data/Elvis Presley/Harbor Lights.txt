i saw the harbor lights


they only told me we were parting
those same old harbor lights
that once brought you to me


i watched the harbor lights
how could i help it?
tears were starting
good-bye to golden nights
beside the silvery seas


i long to hold you dear
and kiss you just once more
but you were on the ship
and i was on the shore


now i know lonely nights
for all the while my heart keeps praying
that someday harbor lights
will bring you back to me
