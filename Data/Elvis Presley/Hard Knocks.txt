some kids born with a silver spoon
i guess that i was born a little too soon


hard knocks
all i ever knew was hard knocks
and i'm telling you, i said you'd better beware
'cause i've had my share


some kids born as rich as a king
but i was born without a doggone thing


hard knocks
all i ever knew was hard knocks
and i'm telling you, i said you'd better beware
'cause i've had my share


i walked a million miles i bet
tired and hungry and cold and wet
i've heard that lonesome whistle blow
from new york city down to mexico


some kids born fancy-free
nobody never gave nothing to me but


hard knocks
all i ever knew was hard knocks
and i'm telling you, i said you'd better beware
'cause i've had my share


i walked a million miles i bet

some kids born fancy-free
nobody never gave nothing to me


but hard knocks
all i ever knew was hard knocks
and i'm telling you, i said you'd better beware
'cause i've had my share (hard knocks)

i said you'd better beware
'cause i've had my share (hard knocks)
i said you'd better beware
'cause i've had my share of hard knocks
