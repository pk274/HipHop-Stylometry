oh, i'm really feeling mighty low
no, no, no, i got no place that i can go
so i've got some blues to sing
and oh, so much remembering, woe


black cats, keep away from me
take my advice, go shinning up a tree
i got hard luck, the hardest kind a luck you'll find
i ain't lyin', i've got the bluest kinda blues
driving' me right outta my mind


she's gone, said toodle-loo
kissed her goodbye and my, my, my money too
i've got hard luck, the hardest kinda luck you've seen
i mean, the way i'm running' lately
my lucky number is thirteen


where do i belong, everything i do is wrong
all wrong, wrong as can be
who's stacking all the decks
lady luck has got the hex on me
i'm on her knee da da da da


shove off, oh, i'm warning you
this thing i caught, you know could be catching too
i've got hard luck, the hardest kinda luck there can be
yes, sir, i guess hard luck always chooses
natural born losers like me, oh ah
