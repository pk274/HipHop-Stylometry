going to travel, going to travel wild and free
i'm going to pack my bags because this great big world is calling me
every pretty girl's going to know i'm around
they're going to know i'm in town on a harem holiday

twenty women, twenty women by my side
i'm going to kiss them all, because i've got to keep them satisfied
going to have the best time money can buy
i'm going to be flying high on a harem holiday


if romeo had a harem holiday
you can bet that juliet would have never been his girl forever


going to go back, going to catch that midnight plane
twenty dancing girls are waiting just to call my name
catch that midnight plane
twenty dancing girls are waiting just to call my name
going to have a ball, i am not going to waste no time
i'm going to make them all mine on a harem holiday




going to travel, going to travel wild and free
i'm going to pack my bags because this great big world is calling me
every pretty girl's going to know i'm around
they're going to know i'm in town on a harem holiday
