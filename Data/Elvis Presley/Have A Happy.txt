now once it was told to me, we're born with a magic key
it opens the door to miracles of spring
it takes you to wishing wells, to ice cream and carousels
and yet this magic key won't unlock a thing


unless you have a happy, you have a happy
have a happy, warm smiling face
i start believing, in believing
let your address be sunshine place


there's love and there's joy i'm told
much more than your heart can hold
it's there like the ring you'd grab on a merry-go-round
the world isn't half as gray with friends on a rainy day
but people keep away when you wear a frown, you've got


to have a happy, you have a happy
have a happy warm smiling face
start believing, in believing
let your address be sunshine place
let your address be sunshine place
let your address be sunshine place
