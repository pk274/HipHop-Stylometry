have i told you lately that i love you?
could i tell you once again somehow?
have i told with all my heart and soul how i adore you?
well darling, i'm telling you now

have i told you lately when i'm sleeping
every dream i dream is you somehow?
have i told you why the nights are long
when you're not with me?
well darling, i'm telling you now


my heart would break in two if i should lose you
i'm no good without you anyhow
and have i told you lately that i love you
well darling, i'm telling you now

my heart would break in two if i should lose you
i'm no good without you anyhow
and have i told you lately that i love you
well darling, i'm telling you now
well darling, i'm telling you now
