this is the moment
i've waited for
i can hear my heart singing
soon bells will be ringing (ring ring ring)


this is the moment
of sweet aloha
i will love you longer than forever
promise me that you will leave me never


here and now dear
all my love, i vow dear
promise me that you will leave me never
i will love you longer than forever


ua sila
pa‘a ‘ia me ‘oe
ko aloha makamae e ipo
ka'u ia e lei a‘e nei la


now that we are one
clouds won't hide the sun
blue skies of hawaii smile
on this, our wedding day
i do love you with all my heart
