i long to be his possession
oh, he is my everything
i remember my days of darkness
without sunshine or sight to lead the way
but a whisper of his voice softly calling
to the arms of my maker to stay


he is my reason for living
oh he is the king of all kings
i long to be his possession
oh, he is my everything


after the lighting and thunder
after the last bell has rung
i want to bow down before him
and hear him say well done
