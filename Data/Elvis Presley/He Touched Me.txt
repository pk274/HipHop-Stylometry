shackled by a heavy burden
need the lord again and shame
then the hand of jesus touched me
and now i am no longer the same


for he touched me
he touched me
he touched me
and what a wonderful joy
joy that foods my soul
something happened and now i know
he touched me
and made me whole


oh since i met this blessed savior
and since he cleansed and made me whole
oh i never cease
never cease to praise him
i'll shout it while eternity rolls
