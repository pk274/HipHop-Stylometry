well, since my baby left me
well, i found a new place to dwell
well, it's down at the end of lonely street
at heartbreak hotel


you make me so lonely baby
well, i'm so lonely
i get so lonely i could die


although it's always crowded
you still can find some room
for broken hearted lovers
to cry away their gloom
and be so


you make me so lonely baby
well, i'm so lonely
i get so lonely i could die


now the bellhop's tears keep flowing
the desk clerk's dressed in black
well they've been so long on lonely street
they'll never look back





you make me so lonely baby
well, i'm so lonely
i get so lonely i could die


well now, if your baby leaves you
and you got a tale to tell
just take a walk down lonely street
to heartbreak hotel
