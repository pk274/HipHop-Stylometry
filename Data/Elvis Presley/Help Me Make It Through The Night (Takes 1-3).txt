two, three, four
two, three, four
take the ribbon—
that's not fast enough, fellas
two, three, four


take the ribbon from your hair
shake it loose, let it fall
layin' soft against my skin
like the shadows on the wall
come and lay down by my side
'til the early morning light
all i'm taking is your time
help me make it through the night


i don't care what's right or wrong
i won't try to understand
let the devil take tomorrow
'cause tonight, i need a friend


yesterday is dead and gone
and tomorrow's out of sight
and it's sad to be alone
help me make it through the night


i don't care what's right or wrong
i won't try to understand
let thе devil take tomorrow
'cause tonight, i need a friеnd


yesterday is dead and gone
and tomorrow's out of sight
and it's sad to be alone
help me make it through the night
i don't wanna be alone
help me make it through the night


i don't wanna be alone
help me make it through the night
