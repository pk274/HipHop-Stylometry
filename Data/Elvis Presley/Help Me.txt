lord, help me walk another mile, just one more mile
i'm tired of walking all alone
lord, help me smile another smile, just one more smile
you know i just can't make it on my own


i never thought i needed help before
i thought that i could get by, by myself
but now i know i just can't take it any more
with a humble heart, on bended knee
i'm begging you, please, help me


come down from your golden throne to me, to lowly me
i need to feel the touch of your tender hand
remove the chains of darkness let me see, lord let me see
just where i fit into your master plan


i never thought i needed help before
i thought that i could get by, by myself
but now i know i just can't take it any more
with a humble heart, on bended knee
i'm begging you, please, help me
with a humble heart, on bended knee
i'm begging you, please, help me
