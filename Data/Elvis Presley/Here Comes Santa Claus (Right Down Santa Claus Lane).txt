here comes santa claus, here comes santa claus
right down santa claus lane
vixen, blitzen, all his reindeer
pulling on the reins

bells are ringing, children singing
all is merry and bright
hang your stockings and say a prayer
'cause santa claus comes tonight


here comes santa claus, here comes santa claus
right down santa claus lane
he's got a bag that's filled with toys
for boys and girls again

hear those sleigh bells jingle jangle
what a beautiful sight
jump in bed and cover up your head
'cause santa claus comes tonight


here comes santa claus, here comes santa claus
right down santa claus lane
he doesn't care if you're rich or poor
he loves you just the same

santa knows that we're god's children
that makes everything right
fill your hearts with christmas cheer
'cause santa claus comes tonight


well, here comes santa claus, here comes santa claus
right down santa claus lane
he'll come around when the chimes ring out
it's christmas morn again

peace on earth will come to all
if we just follow the light
let's give thanks to the lord above
'cause santa claus comes tonight

'cause santa claus comes tonight
