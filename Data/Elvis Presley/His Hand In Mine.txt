you may ask me how i know
my lord is real (my lord is real)
you may doubt the things i say
and doubt the way i feel (the way i feel)
but i know he's real today
he'll always be (he'll always be)
i can feel his hand in mine
and that's enough for me


i will never walk alone
he holds my hand (he holds my hand)
he will guide each step i take
and if i fall, i know he'll understand
till the day he tells me why
he loves me so
i can feel his hand in mine
that's all i need to know
