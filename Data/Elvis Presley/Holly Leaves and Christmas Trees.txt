somewhere in, in the distant night
i hear christmas bells
the gentle snow keeps falling down on people
who are homeward bound
that's the way it's always been
the circle really never ends
christmas seems to come and go
home's a place that i don't know
holly leaves and christmas trees
it's that time of year


lights aglow and mistletoe
don't mean a thing when you're not here
as i walk, walk this lonely street
the sound of snow beneath my feet
i'll think of how, how it used to be
holly leaves and christmas trees
used to mean so much to me
(holly leaves and christmas trees)
