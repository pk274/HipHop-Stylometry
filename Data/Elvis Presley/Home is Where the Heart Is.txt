home is where the heart is
and my heart is anywhere you are
anywhere you are
is home

i don't need a mansion
on a hill that overlooks the sea
anywhere you're with me
is home


maybe i'm a rolling stone
who won't amount to much
but everything that i hold dear
is close enough to touch


for home is where the heart is
and my heart is anywhere you are
anywhere you are
is home, home, home, home, home, home
