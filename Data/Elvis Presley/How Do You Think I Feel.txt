how do you think i feel?
well, i know your love's not real
the girl i'm mad about
is just a gadabout
how do you think i feel?


how do you think we stand?
well, i know you've made your plans
but you've included three
and that's too much for me
how do you think i feel?


i won't be true again
i know that i can't win
so why should i pretend
that you still love me?
