oh lord my god, when i in awesome wonder
consider all the worlds thy hands have made
i see the stars, i hear the rolling thunder
thy power throughout the universe displayed


(when christ shall come with shout of acclamation)
(and take me home, what joy shall fill my heart)
then i shall bow in humble adoration
and there proclaim my god how great thou art


then sings my soul my savior god to thee
how great thou art (how great thou art)
how great thou art (how great thou art)
then sings my soul my savior god to thee
how great thou art
how great thou art
