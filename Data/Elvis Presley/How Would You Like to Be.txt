how would you like to be?
a little circus clown
and you could wear a smile
instead of a frown

how would you like to be?
a little kangaroo
a-hoppin' up and down
and i could hop with you


come on and smile a little, smile a little
hop a little, hop a little
smile a little, hop a little bit with me
smile a little, smile a little
hop a little, hop a little
smile a little, hop a little bit with me

oh ho, a ha, tra la la la la
a ha, tra la la la la


how would you like to be?
a little buzzing bee
instead of a tree
you could buzz around me

how would you like to be?
a little mockingbird
and you can sing me songs
like i never heard


come on and buzz a little, buzz a little
sing a little, sing a little
buzz a little, sing a little bit with me
buzz, buzz, buzz a little
do re me a little
buzz a little, sing a little bit with me

oh ho, a ha, tra la la la la
oh ho, a ha, tra la la la la


how would you like to be?
a little baby bear
and you can hug me tight
anytime you care

how would you like to be?
a little dancing doll
and you could dance with me
every time i call

oh ho, tra la la la la
oh ho, a ha, tra la la la la
