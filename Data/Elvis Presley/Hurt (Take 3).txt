i'm so hurt
to think that you lied to me
i'm hurt
way down deep inside of me


you said our love was true
and we'd never, never part
now you want someone new
and it breaks my heart (breaks my heart)


i'm hurt
much more than you'll ever know
yes, darling, i'm so hurt
because i still love you so


but even though you hurt me
like nobody else could ever do
i would never ever hurt you
not you, not you
