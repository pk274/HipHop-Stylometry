the steps that lead to any church
form a stairway to a star
they're part of god and should be trod
more often than they are


i believe in the man in the sky (the man in the sky)
i believe with his help i'll get by (his help i'll get by)
my footsteps may falter
my eyes may grow dim
but he's my gibraltar
i'm trusting in him


though a sparrow is all i may be (is all i may be)
on me, he will still keep an eye
yes i'm singing his praise
till the end of my days
i believe in the man in the sky


(though a sparrow) sparrow (is all i may be) sparrow am i
(on me, he will still keep an eye) keep an eye
yes i'm singing his praise
till the end of my days
i believe in the man in the sky (sky, man in the sky)
