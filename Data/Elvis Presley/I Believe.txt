i believe for every drop of rain that falls
a flower grows
i believe that somewhere in the darkest night
a candle glows

i believe for everyone who goes astray
someone will come to show the way
i believe, i believe

i believe above a storm the smallest prayer
can still be heard
i believe that someone in the great somewhere
hears every word


every time i hear a new born baby cry
or touch a leaf or see the sky
then i know why
i believe (believe, i believe)

every time i hear a new born baby cry
or touch a leaf or see the sky
then i know why
i believe (i believe)
