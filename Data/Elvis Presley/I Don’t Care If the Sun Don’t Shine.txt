well, i don't care if the sun don't shine
i get my loving in the evening time
when i'm with my baby
well, it ain't no fun with the sun around
i get going when the sun goes down
and i'm with my baby


well, that's when we're going to kiss and kiss
and kiss and kiss
and we're going to kiss some more
who cares how many times we kiss
'cause at a time like this, who keeps score?


well, i don't care if the sun don't shine
i get my loving in the evening time
when i meet my baby


well, that's when we're going to kiss and kiss
and kiss and kiss
and we're going to kiss some more
who cares how many times we kiss
'cause at a time like this, who keeps score?


well, i don't care if the sun don't shine
i get my loving in the evening time
when i meet my baby


and it don't matter if it's sleet or snow
the drive-in's cozy when the lights are low
and i'm with my baby
makes no difference if the rain comes down
i don't notice when she's around
oh boy, what a baby


well, that's when we're going to kiss and kiss
and kiss and kiss
and we're going to kiss some more
well, one kiss from my baby doll
makes me hot, more, more, more, more


well, i don't care if the sun don't shine
i get my loving in the evening time
when i meet my baby


well, that's when we're going to kiss and kiss
and kiss and kiss
and
we're going to kiss some more
well, one kiss from my baby doll
makes me hot, more, more, more, more


well, i don't care if the sun don't shine
i get my loving in the evening time
when i'm with my baby
