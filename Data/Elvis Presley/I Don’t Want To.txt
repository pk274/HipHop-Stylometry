i don't want to, i don't want to
i don't want to let you know how much i want you
don't come near me, i don't trust you
i don't trust the way you thrill me when i touch you


i was happy, free and easy
i could go around and do the things that please me
i don't want to get tied down with a girl like you
i don't want to love you, but i do
