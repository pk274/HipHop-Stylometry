feel so bad
like a ball game on a rainy day
feel so bad
like a ball game on a rainy day
yes, i got my rain check
shake my head and walk away


ooh people, that's the way i feel
ooh people, that's the way i feel
sometimes i think i won't
then again i think i will


sometimes i want to stay here
then again i want to leave here
sometimes i want to leave here
then again i want to stay
yes, i got my train fare
pack my grip and ride away


ooh people, that's the way i feel
ooh people, that's the way i feel
sometimes i think i won't
then again i think i will
