i forgot to remember to forget her
i can't seem to get her off my mind
i thought i'd never miss her
but i found out somehow
i think about her almost all the time


the day she went away
i made myself a promise
that i'd soon forget we ever met
but something sure is wrong
'cause i'm so blue and lonely
i forgot to remember to forget


the day she went away
i made myself a promise
that i'd soon forget we ever met
well, but something sure is wrong
'cause i'm so blue and lonely
i forgot to remember to forget
