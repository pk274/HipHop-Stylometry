i've got something to tell you
that i think you ought to know
that my eyes are on you baby
since a long time ago

and now i finally got the nerve
and i'm gonna make my move
now don't you try to turn me off
cause it's gonna be hard to do


i've got a thing about you baby
ain't nothing i can do
i've got a thing about you baby
a thing about loving you


ain't it just like a woman
when she knows she's got a man
she'll wring you out and turn you about
in the palm of her hand

and then she starts to thinking
then maybe she's put you in a blind
she'll give you just a little lovin'
it'll drive you out of your mind


i've got a thing about you baby
ain't nothing i can do
i've got a thing about you baby
a thing about loving you
