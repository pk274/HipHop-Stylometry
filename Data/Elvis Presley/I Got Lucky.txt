never found a four leaf clover
to bring good luck to me
no rabbit's foot, no lucky star
no magic wishing tree

but i got lucky (i got lucky)
yes, i got lucky (lucky when)
when i found you, oh oh, yeah


got no rainbow around my shoulder
no horseshoe on my door
but i got you to hold me tight
and who could ask for more


but i got lucky (i got lucky)
yes, i got lucky (lucky when)
when i found you, oh oh, yeah
(when i found you)


i always walk around
with all my fingers crossed
i'm afraid the love i found
just might get lost


so won't you tell me that you love me
hurry up and name the day
and then i'll know that my good luck
is really here to stay


oh, i got lucky (i got lucky)
yes, i got lucky (lucky when)
when i found you
(i found you)


i always walk around
with all my fingers crossed
i'm afraid the love i found
just might get lost


so won't you tell me that you love me
hurry up and name the day
and then i'll know that my good luck
is really here to stay


oh, i got lucky (i got lucky)
yes, i got lucky (lucky when)
when i found you
(i found you)

oh, i got lucky (i got lucky)
yes, i got lucky (lucky when)
when i found you
