i got stung by a sweet honey bee
oh, what a feeling come over me
it started in my eyes
crept up to my head
flew to my heart
'til i was stung dead
i'm done, uh-uh
i got stung

she had all that i wanted and more
and i've seen honey bees before
she started buzzing in my ear
buzzing in my brain
got stung all over
but i feel no pain
i'm done

now don't think i'm complaining
i'm mighty pleased we met
but you give one little peck
on the back of my neck
and i break out in a cold, cold sweat


well, if i live to a hundred and two
i won't let nobody sting me but you
i'll be buzzing around your hive
every day at five
and i'm never going to leave once i arrive
because i'm done
uh-uh, i got stung

uh huh, yeah
