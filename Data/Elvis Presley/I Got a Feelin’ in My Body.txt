when moses walked the children out of egypt land
said now don't you worry, we're in the lord's hands
he's gonna walk beside us, the time is coming' near
he's gonna wash away all our misery and our fear


i got a feeling' in my body
this will be our lucky day
we'll be releasing all our sorrow
leave it layin' along the way

when daniel faced the lion there wasn't any doubt
you got to be like daniel and the lord will help us out




won't you lift your eyes up children
lift them to the sky
heaven stands before you, gates are open wide
shelter for the weary, comfort for the weak
we'll leave the devil's evil, sweatin' on the street


i gotta, i gotta, i gotta
i got a feeling in my body
this will be our lucky day
we'll be releasing all our sorrow
leave it layin' along the way






i got a feeling' in my body
this will be our lucky day
we'll be releasing all our sorrow
leave it layin' along the way
