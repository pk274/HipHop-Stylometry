i just can't help believin'
when she smiles up soft and gentle
with a trace of misty mornin'
and a promise of tomorrow in her eyes


i just can't help believin'
when she's lying close beside me
and my heart beats
with the rhythm of her sighs


this time the girl is gonna stay
this time the girl is gonna stay
for more than just a day


well, i just can't help believin'
when she slips her hand in my hand
and it feels so small and helpless
and my fingers fold around it like a glove


and i just can't help believin'
when she's whispering her magic
and her tears are shining
honey-sweet with love


this time the girl is gonna stay (this time the girl is gonna stay)
this time the girl is gonna stay
for more than just a day


ah-ahh-ah
ah-ahh-ah
ah-ahh-ah
ahh-ahh
for more than just a day
(oh, i just can't help believin')
sing the song baby
(oh, i just can't help believin')
one more time
(oh, i just can't help believin')
and one more
(oh, i just can't help believin')
for more than just a day


oh, i just can't help believin'
when she slips her hand in my hand
and it feels so small and helpless
and my fingers fold around it like a glove


and i just can't help believin'
when she smiles and whisper her magic
and her tears are shining
honey-sweet with love


this time the girl is gonna stay (this time the girl is gonna stay)
this time the girl is gonna stay
for more than just a day


(oh, i just can't help believin')
take it
(oh, i just can't help believin')
yo
(oh, i just can't help believin')
(oh, i just can't help believin')
