oh, i love only one girl, the one i got my arms around
i love only one girl, one in every town


in paris there is mimi, and when the moon is bright
i love to take her walking, along the seine each night
i kiss her on the left bank, then i kiss her on the right




i'm proud of my brunhilde, in frankfurt on the rhine
oh she's a lot of woman and all of her is mine
oh she can lift a steinway as easy as a stein




in naples there's maria how she can cook and flirt
you can't beat her lasagna, i eat until i hurt
and then she tops it off with "amore" for dessert
