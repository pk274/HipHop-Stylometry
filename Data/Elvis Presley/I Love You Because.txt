i love you because you understand, dear
every single thing i try to do
you're always there to lend a helping hand, dear
i love you most of all because you're you


no matter what the world may say about me
i know your love will always see me through
i love you for the way you never doubt me
but most of all i love you 'cause you're you


no matter what may be the style or season
i know your heart will always be true
i love you for a hundred thousand reasons
but most of all i love you 'cause you're you
