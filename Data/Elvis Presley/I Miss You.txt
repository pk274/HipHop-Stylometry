still i recall all the good times together
the love we shared, the fun and the laughter
how i wish you could feel what my heart says tonight dear
i miss you and i wish you were here


dreams that i had they lay broken in sorrow
the plans i made the hopes for tomorrow
if i could i would tell you i'm lonesome tonight dear
oh i miss you and i wish you were here


all through the night i will see memories passing
the way you looked the sound of your laughing
how i long for the touch of your hand holding mine dear
oh i miss you and i wish you were here


lord, i miss you and i wish you were here
