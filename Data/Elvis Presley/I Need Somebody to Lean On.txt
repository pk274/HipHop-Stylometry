i need somebody to lean on
i need somebody to, to tell my troubles to
no use denying, i'm close to crying
but what good, tell me, what good would my crying do?


i need somebody to help me
help me forget all those worries on my mind
and when i'm lonely, if someone would only
want to be sweet and kind


i need somebody, won't that somebody
please, please listen to my plea?
need that somebody, won't that somebody
come running to me?


i need somebody to lean on
i'm tired of being unhappy and so blue
if she came, i would hold her
'cause i need that shoulder to lean on, yes, i really do
i need somebody and maybe that somebody is you
