i need you so (i need you so)
to keep me happy
if i can't have you
i cannot go on (i can't go on)

i need your arms (i need your arms)
around me tightly
yes, i miss them nightly
when you're not at home (you're not at home)


when the day is done
i miss you so
i lie and wait
to hear you knock upon the door (knock upon the door)


when you leave me (when you leave me)
i try not to worry
come back in a hurry (please, please come back)
'cause i need you so (i need you so)
