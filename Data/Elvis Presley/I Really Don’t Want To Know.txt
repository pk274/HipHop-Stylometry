oh how many arms have held you
and hated to let you go
how many, oh how many, i wonder
but i really don't want, i don't want to know


oh how many lips have kissed you
and set, set your soul aglow, yes they did
how many, oh how many, i wonder, yes i do
but i really don't want to know


so always make, make me wonder
and always make, make me guess
and even, you know even if i ask you
oh darling oh don't you, don't confess


just let it, let it remain your secret
oh for darling, darling i love you so
no wonder, yeah no wonder, i wonder
mm, 'cause i really don't want, i don't want to know
