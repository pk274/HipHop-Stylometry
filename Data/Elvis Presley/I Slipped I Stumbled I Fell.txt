i look at you and, wham, i'm head over heels
i guess that love is a banana peel
i feel so bad and yet i'm feeling so well
i slipped, i stumbled, i fell


one crazy kiss and, bam, i head for the skies
i guess that love is like a cake of ice
you skate along, but then you can never tell
i slipped, i stumbled, i fell


i never thought i'd get kicked by your sweet talking lies
you got a bag of tricks
and when you got busy, i got dazzled and dizzy
i fell like a ton of bricks


my knees are weak, my head is spinning around
i guess that love has turned me upside down
thought i'd get hurt, but gee, it's turning out swell
i slipped, i stumbled, i fell


i never thought i'd get kicked by your sweet talking lies

thought i'd get hurt, but gee, it's turning out swell
i slipped, i stumbled, i fell
i slipped, i stumbled, i fell
