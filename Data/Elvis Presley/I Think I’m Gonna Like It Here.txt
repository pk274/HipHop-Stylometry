no one's in a hurry
no one seems to worry
why they're all so happy is very clear
everyday siesta
every night fiesta
i think i'm gonna like it here


all this lovely scenery
more to it than greenery
you know a chance for romance is always near
mission bells are ringing
everybody's singing
i think i'm gonna like it here


the sound of laughter from every doorway
sweet music floating across the square
it seems to say things are going your way
your troubles like bubbles will soon disappear in the air


down to my last peso
but not afraid to say so
i feel just like a brave spanish cavalier
i don't care where we go
so lead on mi amigo
i think i'm gonna like it here


melodias, lapieras
your troubles like bubbles will soon disappear in the air


down to my last peso
but i'm not afraid to say so
i feel just like a brave spanish cavalier
i don't care where we go
so lead on mi amigo
i think i'm gonna like it here
i think i'm gonna like it here
i think i'm gonna like it here
