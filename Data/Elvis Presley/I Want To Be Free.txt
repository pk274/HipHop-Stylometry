there's no joy in my heart, only sorrow
and i'm sad as a man can be
i sit alone in the darkness of my lonely room
and this room is a prison to me


i look out my window
and what do i see?
i see a bird
way up in a tree
i want to be free (oh yes), free (oh yes)
free
i want to be free
like a bird in a tree (wanna be free)


oh, what good are my eyes, they can't see you
and my arms, they can't hold you so tight
i have two lips that are yearning
but they're no good to me
'cause i know i can't kiss you tonight


i look out my window
and what do i see?
i see a bird
way up in a tree
i want to be free (oh yes), free (oh yes)
free
i want to be free
like a bird in a tree (want to be free)
i want to be free
like a bird in a tree (want to be free)
