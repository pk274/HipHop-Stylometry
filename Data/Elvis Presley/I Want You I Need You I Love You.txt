hold me close, hold me tight
make me thrill with delight
let me know where i stand from the start


i want you, i need you, i love you
with all my heart


every time that you're near
all my cares disappear
darling, you're all that i'm living for


i want you, i need you, i love you
more and more


i thought i could live without romance
until you came to me
but now i know that i will go on
loving you eternally


won't you please be my own?
never leave me alone
'cause i die every time we're apart


i want you, i need you, i love you
with all my heart


well, i thought i could live without romance
until you came to me
but now i know that i will go
on loving you eternally


won't you please be my own?
never leave me alone
'cause i die every time we're apart


i want you, i need you, i love you
with all my heart
