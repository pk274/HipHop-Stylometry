when i was little my mama said to me
"someday you'll find a love, son, to last eternally"
i want you with me
(i want you with me, i want you with me)
everywhere i go
(i want you with me, i want you with me)
no, please don't leave me, baby, i love you so
(i want you with me, baby, i want you with me)


i'll be the ruler of this whole wide world
if you will only say that you'll be my girl
i want you with me
(i want you with me, i want you with me)
in everything i do
(i want you with me, i want you with me)
well, you know i need you, baby, i'm in love with you
(i want you with me, baby, i mean it)


there is no mountain that i can't climb
you find the mountain, child, and i will find the time
i want you with me
(i want you with me, i want you with me)
with me night and day
(i want you with me, i want you with me)
well, you can make me happy, baby, don't you go away
(i want you with me, baby, one more time)


i'll swim an ocean with a raging foam
if i know that you'll be there when i come back home
i want you with me
(i want you with me, i want you with me)
you know i love you so
(i want you with me, i want you with me)
well, i want you with me, baby, i'll never ever let you go
(i want you with me, baby, oh)


yeah, i want you with me
(i want you with me, i want you with me)
i want you with me
(i want you with me, i want you with me)
well, i want you with me, baby, i'll never let you go
(i want you with me, baby, oh)
