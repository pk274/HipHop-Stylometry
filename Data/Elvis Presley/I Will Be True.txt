i will be true
no matter what they may say
i will be true
although you're far, far away


each night i pray
all day i'll say silent prayers
that when i open my door
i'll find you there


somehow i feel
that someday we'll meet again
don't ask me how
it's something i can't explain
until the day
i give up all hope of you
assure yourself this, i'll do
i will be true


somehow i feel
that someday we'll meet again
don't ask me how
it's something i can't explain

i give up all hope of you
assure yourself this, i'll do
