there must be lights burning brighter somewhere
got to be birds flying higher in a sky more blue
if i can dream of a better land
where all my brothers walk hand in hand
tell me why?
oh why, oh why can't my dream come true?
oh why?


deep in my heart there's a tremblin' question
still i am sure that the answer
answer's gonna come somehow
out there in the dark
there's a beckoning candle, yeah
and while i can think, while i can talk
while i can stand, while i can walk
while i can dream
oh, please let my dream come true
right now
let it come true right now
oh yeah


thank you, good night
