if i get home on christmas day
i won't need soft words to say
i'll miss you and i can stay a while
you'll see it in my eyes and when i smile


if i get home before midnight
while you're still sleeping tight
i'll take you in my arms and there you'll stay
if i get home on christmas day


writing letters everyday
never really seem to say
the way i feel deep in this heart of mine
thought i'm half a world away
if we're patient and we pray
know i'll get my chance with you this time




if i get home before midnight
while you're still sleeping tight
i'll take you in my arms and there you'll stay
if i get home on christmas day
i'll take you in my arms and there you'll stay
if i get home on christmas day
