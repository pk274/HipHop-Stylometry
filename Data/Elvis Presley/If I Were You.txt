the sandman comes to my house late each night
but it's way in the morning before he turns out my life
it's times like this my darling i can see
if i were you i'd know that i love me

the great snowman i've been called by all
but it looks like this time i'm going to fall
it's times like this my darling i can see
ooh if i were you i'd know that i love me


wind and rain and storm closing in on me
i've walked the streets alone with my self sympathy
can you hear me saying hopefully
ooh if i were you i'd know that i love me


wind and rain and storm closing in on me
i've walked the streets alone with my self sympathy
can you hear me saying hopefully
if i were you i'd know that i love me
ooh if i were you i'd know that i love me
if i were you i'd know that i love me
