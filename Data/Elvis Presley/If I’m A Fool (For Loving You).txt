if i'm a fool for loving you
then that's just what i want to be


they're saying i am just your clown
and any fool could see
that you're just having fun
and you're not in love with me


the things they're saying may be true
but there's something they can't see
if i'm a fool for loving you
then that's just what i want to be


if i'm a dreamer, let me dream
if i'm your clown i'll steal the show
if things are not the way they seem
please don't ever let me know


if i am blind it's because
i just don't want to see
if i'm a fool for loving you
then that's just what i want to be






if i'm a fool for loving you
then that's just what i want to be
if i'm a fool for loving you
