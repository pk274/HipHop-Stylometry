woke up early in the morning
what did the poor boy find?
well, the car was gone and you were gone
and i almost lost my mind


if you don't come back
(if you don't come back)
yeah, if you don't come back today
(if you don't come back today)
you can call up the people at the crazy house
and take this crazy man away


threw himself up against a stone wall
he tore his clothes at us all
well, i ran out on the street in my stockinged feet
tell the police i've been robbed




mrs. brown's been talking about me
to the people across the street
she said, "i cooked that boy a bucket of stew
but the poor thing just won't eat"
