if you think i don't need you
then take a look at my eyes
baby, these ain't raindrops
falling out of the sky

since you been gone
i've been so alone
if you think i don't need you
then, baby, you're wrong


if you think i don't love you
what could i do
to prove to you, baby
my love is true?

i sing the same old song
since you've been gone
if you think i don't love you
then, baby, you're wrong


my life ain't been the same since you left me
i ain't had a wink of sleep in seven days
i don't know what to do, i'm going crazy
i just walk the floor at night and call your name


if you think i don't do right
i'll change my ways
i'll do like you want me to
i'll be your slave

since you been gone
i've been so alone
if you think i don't need you
well, baby, you're wrong


if you think i don't do right
i'll change my ways
i'll do like you want me
i'll be your slave

since you been gone
i've been so alone
if you think i don't need you
well, baby, you're wrong
well, baby, you're wrong
well, baby, you're wrong
