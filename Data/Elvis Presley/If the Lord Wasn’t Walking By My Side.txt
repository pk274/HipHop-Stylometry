what would i do
(what would i do when a tear fills my eyes)
what would i do
(what would i do when it's my time to die)
well, i'd be lonely, discouraged
burdened on the way
if the lord wasn't walking by my side every day


i'd be so friendless
(i'd be friendless all alone and blue)
and i'd be helpless
(i'd be helpless, wouldn't know what to do)
and i don't know
(i don't know)
just what i'd do
if the lord wasn't walking by my side

if the lord (wasn't walking) wasn't walking by my side
