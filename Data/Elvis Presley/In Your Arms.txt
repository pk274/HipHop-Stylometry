oh, the way i feel tonight
you better wrap me up good and tight
in your arms (in your arms)
in your arms (in your arms)


just like a bee in a honeycomb
i'm gonna make myself right at home
in your arms (in your arms)
in your arms (in your arms)


well, it don't take much to keep me satisfied
just a little bit of loving, that's bonafide
in your arms keep me tangled up all the time
like a kitten with a ball of twine


yeah baby, that's where i wanna stay
for the rest of my natural days
in your arms (in your arms)
in your arms (in your arms)


well, it don't take much to keep me satisfied

in your arms (in your arms)
in your arms (in your arms)
in your arms (in your arms)
in your arms (in your arms)
