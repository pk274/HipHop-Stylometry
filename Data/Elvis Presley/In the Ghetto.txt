as the snow flies
on a cold and gray chicago mornin'
a poor little baby child is born
in the ghetto (in the ghetto)
and his mama cries
'cause if there's one thing that she don't need
it's another hungry mouth to feed
in the ghetto (in the ghetto)


people, don't you understand
a child needs a helping hand
or he'll grow to be an angry young man someday?
take a look at you and me
are we too blind to see?
do we simply turn our heads
and look the other way?


well, the world turns
well, the world turns
and a hungry little boy with a runny nose
plays in the street as the cold wind blows
in thе ghetto (in the ghetto)
and his hungеr burns
so he starts to roam the streets at night
and he learns how to steal, and he learns how to fight
in the ghetto (in the ghetto)


then one night in desperation
the young man breaks away
he buys a gun, he steals a car
tries to run, but he don't get far


and his mama cries
and his mama cries
as a crowd gathers 'round an angry young man
facedown on the street with a gun in his hand
in the ghetto (in the ghetto)
and as her young man dies
as her young man dies
on a cold and gray chicago mornin'
another little baby child is born
in the ghetto (in the ghetto)


and his mama cries
and his mama cries
on a cold and gray chicago mornin'
another little baby child is born
in the ghetto
in the ghetto
on a cold and gray chicago mornin'
another little baby child is born
in the ghetto
in the ghetto
on a cold and gray chicago mornin'
another little baby child is born
in the ghetto
