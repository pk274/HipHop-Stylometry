oh, if you tell a lie
you know that i'll forgive you
though you say our love is just a game
and when you hear my name
you'll say i'm from a strange world
but is it so strange to be in love with you


is it so strange
that i love you more than all the world
is it so strange
i have no eyes for any other girl


oh, won't you take me back
and say that you still love me
to waste a love like ours would be a sin
let us kiss again
let me hold you near
and take me from this strange world
that i'm living in
