it hurts me to see him treat you the way that he does
it hurts me to see sit you and cry
when i know i could be so true
if i had someone like you
it hurts me to see those tears in your eyes


the whole town is talking, they're calling you a fool
for listening to his same old lies
and when i know i could be so true
if i had someone like you
it hurts me to see the way he makes you cry


you love him so much, you're too blind to see
he's only playing a game
he never loved you, he never will
and, darling, don't you know he'll never change


i know that he never will set you free
because he's just that kind of guy
but if you ever tell him you're through
i'll be waiting for you
waiting to hold you so tight
waiting to kiss you goodnight
yes, darling, if i had someone like you
