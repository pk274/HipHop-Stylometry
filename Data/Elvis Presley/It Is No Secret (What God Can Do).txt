the chimes of time ring out the news
another day is through
someone slipped and fell
was that someone you?

you may have longed for added strength
your courage to renew
do not be disheartened
for i have news for you


it is no secret what god can do
what he's done for others, he'll do for you
with arms wide open, he'll pardon you
it is no secret what god can do


there is no night for in his light
you'll never walk alone
always feel at home
wherever you may go

there is no power can conquer you
while god is on your side
take him at his promise
don't run away and hide


it is no secret what god can do
what he's done for others, he'll do for you
with arms wide open, he'll pardon you
it is no secret what god can do
