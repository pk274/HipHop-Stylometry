oh, it won't seem like christmas, oh, without you
far too many miles are between
but if i get the one thing that i'm wishing for
well then i'll see you tonight in my dreams


seems a long time since we've been together
it was just about to this time of the year
looks like it's a-gonna be snowy weather
how i wish that you could be here


but it won't seem like christmas, oh, without you
far too many miles are between
but if i get the one thing that i'm wishing for
then i'll see you tonight in my dreams


in the distance i hear sleigh bells ringing
the holly is so pretty this year
and the carol that somebody's singing
reminds me of our christmas last year


oh, but it won't be like christmas without you
far too many miles are between
oh, but if i get the one thing that i'm wishing for
then i'll see you tonight in my dreams


yes i'll see you tonight in my dreams
