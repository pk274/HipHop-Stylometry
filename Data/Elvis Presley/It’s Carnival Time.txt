come on, kids from eight to 80
hey there, mister, bring your lady
there's a big show on the inside
it's carnival time


popcorn, peanuts, and cotton candy
pink lemonade that's dan-dan-dandy
be a big shot for a dollar
it's carnival time


roustabouts roustabouting
and there's happy shouts, children shouting
if you've got doubts quit your doubtin'
there's thrills, it's spice
it's cheap at half the price


so don't be bashful, buy a ticket
get the habit, never kick it
hit the band there, don't just stand there
it's carnival time
