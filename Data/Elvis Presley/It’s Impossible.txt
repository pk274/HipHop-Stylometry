it's impossible, tell the sun to leave the sky
it's just impossible
it's impossible to ask a baby not to cry
it's just impossible
can i hold you closer to me
and not feel you going through me?
but the second that i never think of you
oh, how impossible


can the ocean keep from rushing to the shore?
it's just impossible
if i had you, could i ever ask for more?
it's just impossible
and tomorrow should you ask me for the world
somehow i'd get it, i would sell my very soul
and not regret it, for to live without your love
is just impossible

and not regret it, for to live without your love
is just impossible
(impossible)
oh, impossible
(impossible)
impossible

thank you very much
