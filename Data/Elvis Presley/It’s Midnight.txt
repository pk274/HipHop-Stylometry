maybe it's too late
sometimes even hate myself
for loving you


trying to be strong
then nighttime comes along
and i start loving you, wanting you
where is all my self-control?
i'm burning way down in my soul
and needing you
wishing i could be the man i try to
hating me for wanting to be with you
knowing you don't love me like you used to
but it's midnight, oh, and i miss you


it's getting late and i know
that's when i am weak
funny how things have a way
of looking so much brighter in the daylight


i hope to go to bed
and try to straighten out my head
and just forget you
oh, but it's midnight and i miss you


it's getting late and i know
that's when i am weak
funny how things have a way
of looking so much brighter in the daylight


i hope to go to bed
and try to straighten out my head
and just forget you
oh, but it's midnight and i miss you


it's midnight and i miss you
