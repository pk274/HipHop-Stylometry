i see the sunlight in her hair
i feel the warm smile that she wears
she has no recipe for love
but i just can't get enough
from the distance of my mind
clock that's ringing says it's time
wake up to my destiny
it's time to face reality


it's only love that i feel inside
but i'll get by somehow
it's only love, there must be something else for me girl


i tell myself that it's not real
there's nothing left for me to feel
i'll just be going on my way
tomorrow brings another day


it's only love that i feel inside
but i've got to be strong, my mind's hanging on
it's only love, but i know i'll get by
i'll take my heart and my pride, and just throw it aside
it's only love


it's only love, it's only love, it's only love
it's only love
it's only love
