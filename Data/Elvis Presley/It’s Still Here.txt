the day you said we'd never part
you turned around and broke my heart
you had the nerve to tell me i would soon forget
now you've been gone away one year
and i have not forgotten, dear
the love i had for you so long
is still here
wow-oh


it's here, still here
because my heart cannot believe
we're really through
and though you said we'd never part
you turned around and broke my heart
the love i had for you so long
is still here
