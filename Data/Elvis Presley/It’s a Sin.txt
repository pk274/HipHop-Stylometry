it's a sin, my darling, how i love you
because i know our love could never be
it's a sin to keep this memory of you
when silence proves that you've forgotten me


the dreams i built for us has tumbled
each promise broken like my heart
it's a sin, my darling, how i love you
so much in love and yet so far apart


i'm sure you're happy with another
who shares the love i could not win
why pretend that i can live without you
when deep inside i know that it's a sin?
