young as a circus parade, it's a wonderful world
pretty as pink lemonade, it's a wonderful world
life is a carnival, live it for all you're worth
you are the star of the greatest show on earth


this big wide world is a clown with his nose painted red
a rainbow-colored balloon's dancing high overhead
it's everyone's oyster, step up, get your pearl
it's a wonderful, wonderful, wonderful, wonderful world
