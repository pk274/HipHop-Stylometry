all right


well, i'll be back, yeah, i'll be back
like a homesick train on a one-way track
i got to travel and hit the gravel
but i'll be back, yeah, i'll be back

well, i'll return, i shall return
don't cool those lips, we're gonna see them burn
cause i'll be missing your kind of kissing
but i'll be back, yeah, i'll be back


yeah, there ain't nobody to tell me stay or go, oh no
and no one tells the four winds where to blow
i'll be back, i'm coming back
don't throw away that welcome mat


the door i'm hoping, will still be open a teeny weenie crack
to your shack
so keep that love light burnin'
but i'll be back, yeah, i'll be back




the door i'm hoping will still be open a teeny weenie crack

yeah, i'll be back
