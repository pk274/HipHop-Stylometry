how many stars are in the sky
i'll never know
what fire lights a firefly
i'll never know


what happens to this heart of mine
each time you hold my hand
sometimes the things we love the most
we never understand


i never thought these eyes would see
an angel's glow
what miracle brought you to me
i'll never know






what miracle brought you to me
i'll never know
