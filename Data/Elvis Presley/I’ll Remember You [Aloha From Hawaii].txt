i'll remember you
long after this endless summer has gone
i'll be lonely, oh, so lonely
living only to remember you


i'll remember too
your voice as soft as a warm summer breeze
your sweet laughter, mornings after
ever after, i'll remember you


to your arms someday
i'll return to stay
'tll then


i will remember too
every bright star we made wishes upon
love me always, promise always
ooh, you'll remember too
(remember too)


i'll remember you
