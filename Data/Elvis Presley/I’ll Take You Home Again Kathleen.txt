i'll take you home again, kathleen
across the ocean wild and wide
to where your heart has ever been
since first, you were my bonny bride


the roses all have left your cheek
i watch them fade away and die
your voice is soft whenever you speak
and tears bedim your lovely eye


oh, i will take you home, kathleen
to where your heart shall feel no pain
and when the fields are soft and green
i will take you to your home, kathleen
