well, it's so very hard to have to leave the one you love
and you get more lonely with each passin' day
it's so lonely just sittin' there and dreamin' of
that girl a thousand miles away


yes, it's still lonely having just her picture here with me
and i know i just can't stand it anymore
i'm gonna leave right now and go back where i oughta be
goin' home to the girl i adore


well, it's so very hard to have to leave the one you love
and you get morе lonely with each passing day
it's so lonely just sittin' thеre and thinkin' of
that girl a thousand miles away


well, every time i hear her sweet voice on the telephone
then i know i just can't stand it another day
i'm gonna call right back and tell her that i'm comin' home
call her back and say i'm comin' home to stay
call her back and say i'm comin' home to stay
