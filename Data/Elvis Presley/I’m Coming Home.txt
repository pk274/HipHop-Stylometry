well, it's so very hard to have to leave the one you love
and you get more lonely with each passing day
it's so lonely just sitting there and dreaming of
that girl a thousand miles away


yes, it's still lonely having just her picture here with me
and i know i just can't stand it anymore
i'm gonna leave right now and go back where i ought to be
going home to the girl that i adore


well, it's so very hard to have to leave the one you love
and you get more lonely with each passing day
it's so lonely just sitting there and thinking of
that girl a thousand miles away


well, every time i hear her sweet voice on the telephone
then i know i just can't stand it another day
i'm gonna call right back and tell her that i'm coming home
call her back and say i'm coming home to stay
call her back and say i'm coming home to stay
