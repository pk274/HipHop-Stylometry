all the words that i let her know
still could not say
how much i need you so
in every way


i go wrong, and you guide me
and only you can do
hold my hands down beside me
i'm counting on you


i'm counting on you, dear
from the dawn of each day
to always come through, dear
in your kind loving way


if you knew just how deeply
i feel the things you do
then you'd know how completely
i'm counting on you


i'm counting on you, dear
from the dawn of each day
to always come through, dear
in your kind loving way


if you knew just how deeply
i feel the things you do
then you'd know how completely
i'm counting on you
