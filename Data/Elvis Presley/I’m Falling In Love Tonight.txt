i'm falling in love tonight
somehow i know
the beautiful world tonight
is sharing its glow

when love let me down before
i said i was through
but i'm falling in love tonight
with you


till you walked by
i laughed and played the game
one kiss, then goodbye
and out went the flame


but somehow, you've changed me, dear
this time it's true
i'm falling in love tonight
with you
