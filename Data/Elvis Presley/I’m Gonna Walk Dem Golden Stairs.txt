i'm gonna walk, walk dem golden stairs
'cause i know my jesus answers all my prayers
well, well i know when he calls me to my home on high
i'll walk dem golden stairs when i die, when i die


oh lord, you know i can hardly wait
to reach that suite by and by, by and by
and now i see those pearly gates
i'll walk dem golden stairs when i die, when i die


well, well, well
i'm gonna walk, walk dem golden stairs
'cause i know my jesus answers all my prayers
well, well i know when he calls me to my home on high
i'll walk dem golden stairs when i die, when i die


when jesus says to me, "well done"
and all my cares are laid by
i'll lay down my soul, my battles are all won
i'll walk dem golden stairs when i die when i die


well, well, well
i'm gonna walk, walk dem golden stairs
'cause i know my jesus answers all my prayers
well, well i know when he calls me to my home on high
i'll walk dem golden stairs when i die, when i die

well, well, well
i'm gonna walk, walk dem golden stairs
'cause i know my jesus answers all my prayers
well, well i know when he calls me to my home on high
i'll walk dem golden stairs when i die, when i die
