well, you're right, i'm left, she's gone
you're right, and i'm left all alone
well, you tried to tell me so
but how was i to know
that she was not the one for me?

you told me all along
you're right, our love was so wrong
but now i changed my mind
because she broke the ties that bind
and i know that she never cared for me


well, i thought i knew just what she'd do
i guess i'm not so smart
oh, you tried to tell me along
she'd only break my heart
i'm left, you're right, she's gone
you're right, and i'm left all alone


well, she's gone i know not where
but now i just don't care
for now i'm falling for you

if you'll forgive me now
i'll make it up somehow
so happy we will be
in a home just for three
and i'll soon forget her
now i know


well, i thought i knew just what she'd do
i guess i'm not so smart
you tried to tell me all along
she'd only break my heart


well, you're right, i'm left, she's gone
you're right, and i'm left all alone
well, she's gone, i know not where
but now i just don't care
for now i've fallen for you
