hear that lonesome whip-poor-will
he sounds too blue to fly
the midnight train is whining low
i'm so lonesome i could cry


did you ever see a robin weep
when leaves began to die
that means he's lost the will to live
i'm so lonesome i could cry


the silence of a falling star
lights up a purple sky
and as i wonder where you are
i'm so lonesome i could cry
i'm so lonesome i could cry
