my love i offer you now
my heart and all it can give
for just as long as i live
i'm yours

no arms but yours, dear, will do
my lips will always be true
my eyes can see only you
i'm yours


and as the years roll along
your joy, your tears, i'll gladly share
and when things go wrong, dear
just hold out your hand and i'll be there


with every beat of my heart
with every breath that i take
now and forever, sweetheart
i'm yours


and as the years roll on
your joy and tears, i'll gladly share
and when things go wrong, dear
just hold out your hand and i'll be there


with every beat of my heart
with every breath that i take
now and forever, sweetheart
i'm yours
