when trouble is in my way
i can't tell the night from day
i toss from side to side
like a ship on a raging tide
i don't worry and i don't fret
god has never failed me yet
trouble's coming from time to time
but that's all right
cause i'm not the worrying kind


because i, i've got confidence
god is gonna see me through
no matter what the case may be
i know he's gonna fix it for me


job was so sick so long
till the flesh fell from his bones
his wife, cattle and children
everything that he had was gone
but job he never despaired
he knew that god still cared
sleepless days and sleepless nights
job said "honey, that's all right"




some folks wonder how i smile
even though i'm going to trial
how can i have a song
everything is going wrong
i don't worry and i don't fret
god has never failed me yet


trouble's coming from time to time
that's all right, i'm not the worrying kind
cause i've got confidence
