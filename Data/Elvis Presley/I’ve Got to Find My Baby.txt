i've got to find my baby
i wonder where can she be
has anybody seen her
send her back to me


she left me here all alone
and i ain't had no loving
since my baby's been gone
my baby's gone


i've got to find my baby
i got to hold her tight and tell her i love her
tell her everything's all right
so i'll keep searching
all night long
and i ain't had no loving
since my baby's been gone
my baby's gone


i've got to find my baby
i've got to find my baby
got to find my baby
