the warden threw a party in the county jail
the prison band was there and they began to wail
the band was jumping and the joint began to swing
you shoulda heard those knocked out jailbirds sing


let's rock, everybody, let's rock
everybody in the whole cell block
was dancing to the jailhouse rock


spider murphy played the tenor saxophone
little joey blowing on the slide trombone
the drummer boy from illinois went crash, boom, bang
the whole rhythm section was the purple gang


let's rock, everybody, let's rock
everybody in the whole cell block
was dancing to the jailhouse rock


number forty-seven said to number three
"you the cutest jailbird i ever did see
i sure would be delighted with your company
come on and do the jailhouse rock with me"


let's rock, everybody, let's rock
everybody in the whole cell block
was dancing to the jailhouse rock
rock, rock, rock


sad sack was sitting on a block of stone
way over in the corner weeping all alone
the warden said, "hey, buddy, don't you be no square
you can't find a partner, use a wooden chair"


let's rock, everybody, let's rock
everybody in the whole cell block
was dancing to the jailhouse rock


shifty henry said to bugs, "for heaven's sake
no one's looking, now's our chance to make a break"
bugsy turned to shifty and he said, "nix nix
i wanna stick around a while and get my kicks."


let's rock, everybody, let's rock
everybody in the whole cell block
was dancing to the jailhouse rock


dancing to the jailhouse rock
dancing to the jailhouse rock
dancing to the jailhouse rock
dancing to the jailhouse rock
