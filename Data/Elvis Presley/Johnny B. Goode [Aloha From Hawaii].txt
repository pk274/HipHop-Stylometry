deep down in louisiana close to new orleans
way back up in the woods among the evergreens
stood a log cabin made of earth and wood
where lived a country boy named johnny b. goode
who never learned to read or write so well
but he could play the guitar just like ringing a bell


go, go, go johnny go, go, go johnny, go go
go johnny go, go, go johnny go go
johnny b. goode


his mama told him "someday you will be a man
and you will be the leader of a big band
many people coming from miles around
to hear your playing music when the sun goes down
maybe someday you will be in lights saying johnny b. goode"
