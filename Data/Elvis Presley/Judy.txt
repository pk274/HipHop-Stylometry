they say you found somebody new
whose love will always be true
i don't know what it is to be alone
that's why i dread to know you're gone

oh, judy
don't let our sweet love wither and die like flowers in the fall
oh, judy
don't you know it's you i love most of all


oh, please
come back, i promise always to be true
oh, judy
there'll never be anyone else, dear, but you


oh, please
come back, i promise always to be true
oh, judy
there'll never be anyone else, dear, but you


oh, judy
there'll never be anyone else, dear, but you
oh, judy
there'll never be anyone else, dear, but you
