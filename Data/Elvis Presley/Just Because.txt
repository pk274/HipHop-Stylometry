well, well, well just because you think you're so pretty
and just because your momma thinks you're hot
well, just because you think you've got something
that no other girl has got
you've caused me to spend all my money
you laughed and called me old santa claus
well, i'm telling you, baby, i'm through with you
because, well well, just because


well, well, well there'll come a time when you'll be lonesome
and there'll come a time when you'll be blue
well, there'll come a time when old santa
he won't pay your bills for you
you've caused me to lose all my women
and now, now you say we are through
well, i'm telling you, baby, i was through with you
a long, long, long time ago


well, just because you think you're so pretty
and just because your mama thinks you're the hottest thing in town
well, just because you think you've got something
that nobody else has got
you've caused me to spend all of my money
honey, you laughed and called me your old santa claus
well, i'm telling you, baby, i'm through with you
because, well well, just because
