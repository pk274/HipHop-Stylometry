why must i love a heartless woman
who never knows the harm she's done
though love is blind i should have known
just call me lonesome from now on


i climb the stairs up to my room
but no-one greets me in my gloom
the silence tells me she is gone
just call me lonesome from now on


these walls will hide me when i cry
i hope that heaven lets me die
what good is life when hope has gone
just call me lonesome from now on


just call me lonesome from now on
