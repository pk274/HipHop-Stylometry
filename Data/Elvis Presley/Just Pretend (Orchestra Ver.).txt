just pretend, i'm holding you
and whispering things soft and low
and think of me, how it's going to be
just pretend i didn't go


when i walked away, i heard you say
if you need me, you know what to do
if i knew it then, i'd be back again
so just pretend i'm right there with you


and i'll come flying to you, again
all my crying is true
oh, i will hold you and love you again
but until then, we'll just pretend


oh, it's funny but i can't recall
the things we said or why you're crying
but now i know it was wrong to go
i belong there by your side


and, i'll come flying to you, again
all my crying is true
oh, i will hold you and love you again
but until then, we'll just pretend


i will hold you and love you again
but until then, w–µ'll just pretend
