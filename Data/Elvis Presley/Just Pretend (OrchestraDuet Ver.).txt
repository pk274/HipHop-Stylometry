 (elvis)
just pretend, i'm holding you
and whispering things soft and low
and think of me, how it's going to be
just pretend i didn't go

 (helene)
when i walked away, i heard you say
if you need me, you know what to do
if i knew it then, i'd be back again
so just pretend i'm right there with you (duet)

 (duet)
and i'll come flying to you, again
all my crying is true
oh, i will hold you and love you again
(elvis)
but until then, we'll just pretend


(helene)
oh, it's funny but i can't recall
the things we said or why you're crying
(elvis)
but now i know it was wrong to go
i belong thеre by your side

 (duet)
and, i'll comе flying to you, again
all my crying is true
oh, i will hold you and love you again
(helene)
but until then, we'll just pretend

 (duet)
i will hold you and love you again
but until then, we'll just pretend
