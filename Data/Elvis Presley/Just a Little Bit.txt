i don't want much
just want a little bit
don't want it all
just a little bit
give me an eeny weeny bit
a teeny weeny bit of your love


turn your lamps down low
slip me a kiss
turn your lights down low
i won't let you resist
i want an eeny weeny bit
a teeny weeny bit of your love


early in the morning
well just a little bit
around midnight
just a little bit
i want an eeny weeny bit
a teeny weeny bit of your love


walk with me
just a little bit
i said talk to me
just a little bit
i want an eeny weeny bit
a teeny weeny bit of your love


i want you to remember
to say that you'll be mine
say you'll never leave me
till the end of time
i want an eeny weeny bit
a teeny weeny bit of your love
i want an eeny weeny bit
a teeny weeny bit of your love
