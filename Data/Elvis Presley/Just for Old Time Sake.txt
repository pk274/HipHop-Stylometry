just for old time sake
won't you give my heart a break
let's get together again
let's relive the time
i was yours and you were mine
life was so wonderful then


i know, now i know
the day i let you go
i made my greatest mistake
if you loved me then
you could love me once again
won't you try just for old time sake

i know, yes i know
the day i let you go
i made my greatest mistake
if you loved me then
you could love me once again
won't you try just for old time sake
