there's a man in new orleans who plays rock and roll
he's a guitar man with a great big soul
he lays down a beat like a ton of coal
he goes by the name of king creole


you know he's gone, gone, gone
jumping like a catfish on a pole
you know he's gone, gone, gone
hip-shaking king creole


when the king starts to do it, it's as good as done
he holds his guitar like a tommy gun
he starts to growl from way down in his throat
he bends a string and that's all she wrote


you know he's gone, gone, gone
jumping like a catfish on a pole, yeah
you know he's gone, gone, gone
hip-shaking king creole (king creole)


well, he sings a song about a crawdad hole
he sings a song about a jelly roll
he sings a song about a-pork and greens
he sings some blues about new orleans


you know he's gone, gone, gone
jumping like a catfish on a pole yeah
you know he's gone, gone, gone
hip-shaking king creole (king creole, go)


he plays something evil, then he plays something sweet
no matter how he plays, you gotta get up on your feet
when he gets a rocking fever, baby, heaven sakes
he don't stop playing till his guitar breaks


you know he's gone, gone, gone
jumping like a catfish on a pole, yeah
you know he's gone, gone, gone
hip-shaking king creole (king creole)

you know he's gone, gone, gone
hip-shaking king creole (creole, creole, creole)
