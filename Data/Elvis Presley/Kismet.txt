when you meet by chance, it's not just by chance
it's kismet
when two hearts stand still, it's destiny's will
it's kismet


the wheel of fortune spins, round and around it goes
who will the arrow point to, only kismet knows
until you came by, kismet and i were strangers
but now that you're here, it's suddenly clear we've met


this is my lucky day, love's in the cards, i'd say
thanks to kismet, kismet, kismet
