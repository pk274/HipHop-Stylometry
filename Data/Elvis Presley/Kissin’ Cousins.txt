well, i've got a gal, she's as cute as she can be
she's a distant cousin, but she's not too distant with me
we kiss all night
i'll squeeze her tight
but we're kissin' cousins, that's what makes it all right
all right, all right, all right


oh, i've got a girl, and she taught me how to live
she can give a lot and she's got a lot to give
we kiss all night
i'll squeeze her tight
but we're kissin' cousins, that's what makes it all right
all right, all right, all right


yes, we're all cousins, that's what i believe
'cause we're children of adam and eve


i got a gal and she wants a lot of love
that's the kind of trouble i need plenty of
we'll kiss all night
i'll squeeze her tight
but we'll be kissin' cousins and that'll make it all right
all right, all right, all right
we'll be kissin' cousins and that'll make it all right
all right, all right, all right


yes, we're all cousins, that's what i believe
'cause we're children of adam and eve


i got a gal and she wants a lot of love
that's the kind of trouble i been thinkin' of
we'll kiss all night
i'll squeeze her tight
but we'll be kissin' cousins and that'll make it all right
all right, all right, all right
we'll be kissin' cousins and that'll make it all right
all right, all right, all right
