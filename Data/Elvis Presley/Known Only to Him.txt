known only to him are the great hidden secrets
i'll fear not the darkness when my flame shall dim
i know not what the future holds
but i know who holds the future
it's a secret known only to him


in this world of fear and doubt
on my knees i ask the question
why a lonely, heavy cross i must bear
then he tells me in my prayer
it's because i am trustworthy
he gives me strength far more than my share


known only to him are the great hidden secrets
i'll fear not the darkness when my flame shall dim
i know not what the future holds
but i know who holds the future
it's a secret known only to him (only to him)
