ku‘u ipo
i love you more today
more today than yesterday
but i love you less today
less than i will tomorrow


see the sweet hawaiian rose
see it blossom, see it grow
that's the story of our love
ever since we said hello


ku‘u ipo
i love you more today
more today than yesterday
but i love you less today
less than i will tomorrow


as the years go passing by
we'll recall our wedding day
i will be there by your side
you will always hear me say


ku‘u ipo
i love you more today
more today than yesterday
but i love you less today
less than i will tomorrow


ku‘u ipo,ku‘u ipo, you're my hawaiian sweetheart
ku‘u ipo,ku‘u ipo, you're my hawaiian sweetheart
