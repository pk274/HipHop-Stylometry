lead me oh lord, won't you lead me
i am tired and i need thy strength and power
to guide me over my darkest hour
for just open my eyes that i may see
lead me oh lord, won't you lead me


lead me, guide me along the way
for if you lead me i cannot stray
or just open my eyes that i may see
lead me oh lord, won't you lead me
i am lost if you take your hand from me
i am blind without try light to see


lord just always let me thy servant be
lead me oh lord, won't you lead me
lead me, guide me along the way
for if you lead me i cannot stray


lord just open my eyes that i may see
lead me oh lord, won't you lead me
