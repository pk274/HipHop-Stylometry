god bless the day i found you
i want to stay around you
and so i beg you
let it be me

don't take this heaven from one
well, if you must cling to someone
now and forever
let it be me


each time we meet love
i find complete love
without your sweet love
tell me, what would life be?


so never leave me lonely
just tell me you love me only
and that you'll always
let it be me


each time we meet love
i find complete love
oh ,without your sweet love
tell me, what would life be?


so never leave me lonely
just tell me you love me only
and that you'll always
let it be me

and that you'll always
let it be me


so never leave me lonely
tell me you love me only
and that you'll always
let it be me
