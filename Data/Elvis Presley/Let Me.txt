whenever i dance with the girl i love
my head goes 'round and 'round
when she's close to me
i can't stay on the ground

whenever i dance with the girl i love
i never have a care
all night i'm so light
i walk right on the air


oh let me, oh honey let me
let me do what you know i love to do
please take another chance and let me
let me have another dance with you


whenever i feel those pretty arms
reaching 'round about
that feeling goes to my toes
and all the lights go out, go out, go out

whenever i see those eyes of blue
smiling up so shy
i'm in such a spin
i take right off and fly


so let me, oh honey let me
let me do what you know i love to do
please take another chance and let me
let me have another dance with you


so let me dance in the arms i love
thrill me through and through
i'm so drunk with love
and all i see is you

i never hear the music play
i never see the crowd
only you and me
dancing on a cloud, a cloud, a cloud


oh let me, oh honey let me
let me do what you know i love to do
please take another chance and let me
let me have another dance with you
