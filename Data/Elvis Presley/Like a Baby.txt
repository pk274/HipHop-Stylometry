you gave me love to enjoy
like a bright shiny toy to a baby
no matter what you would do
i depended on you like a baby
one thing i know i love you
yes, i loved you like a baby

it was a fool's heart you took
and i fell 'cause you look like a baby
to lovers' ways, i was blind
'cause i just had a mind like a baby
you're just a flirt
and i had to be hurt just like a baby

(oh, oh, oh, oh)
(oh, oh, oh, oh)
(oh, oh, oh, oh)
i need you so, i need you so

the day i found how you lied
then i broke down and cried like a baby
well, it was then i could see
you were playing with me like a baby
well, you can bet that someday
i'll forget just like a baby
