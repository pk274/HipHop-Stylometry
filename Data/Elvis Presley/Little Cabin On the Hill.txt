tonight i'm alone without you, my dear
it seems that there's a longing for you still
oh, but i just keep it there so i won't be alone
in our little cabin home on the hill


oh, someone has taken you from me
and left me here all alone
to listen to the rain beat on our window pane
in our little cabin home on the hill
(play it, tom!)


oh, someone has taken you from me
and left me here all alone
to listen to the rain beat on our window pane
in our little cabin home on the hill
