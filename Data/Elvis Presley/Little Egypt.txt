i went and bought myself a ticket
and i sat down in the very first row
they pulled the curtain
but then when they turned the spotlight way down low
little egypt came out struttin'
wearing nothin' but a button and a bow


singing, ying-ying, ying-ying
ying-ying, ying-ying


she had a ruby on her tummy
and a diamond big as texas on her toe
she let her hair down
and she did the hoochie-coochie real slow
when she did her special number on the zebra skin
i thought she'd stop the show


singing, ying-ying, ying-ying
ying-ying, ying-ying


she did her triple somersault and when she hit the ground
she winked at the audience and then she turned around
she had a picture of a cowboy tattooed on her spine
said, phoenix, arizona 1949


yeah, but let me tell you people
little egypt doesn't dance there anymore
she's too busy mopping
and a-takin' care of shopping at the store
'cause we've got seven kids
and all day long they crawl around the floor


singing, ying-ying, ying-ying
ying-ying, ying-ying
