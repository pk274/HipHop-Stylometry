little sister, don't you
little sister, don't you
little sister, don't you kiss me once or twice
then say it's very nice
and then you run
little sister, don't you do what your big sister done


well, i dated your big sister
and i took her to a show
i went for some candy

and they snuck right out the door


little sister, don't you
little sister, don't you
little sister, don't you kiss me once or twice
then say it's very nice
and then you run

every time i see your sister
well, she's got somebody new
she's mean and she's evil
like that little ol' boll weevil

little sister, don't you kiss me once or twice
then say it's very nice
and then you run
little sister, don't you do what your big sister done

and pinch your turned-up nose
but you been a-growing
and baby, it's been showing
from your head down to your toes


little sister, don't you
little sister, don't you
little sister, don't you kiss me once or twice
then say it's very nice
and then you run
little sister, don't you do what your big sister done
