it's a lonely man (ooh)
who wanders all around (lonely man)
it's a lonely man (ooh)
who roams from town to town

searching, always searching
for something he can't find
hoping, always hoping
that someday fate will be kind


it's a lonely man (ooh)
who travels all alone (lonely man)
when he has no one (ooh)
that he can call his own

always so unhappy
taking shelter where he can
here i am
come meet a lonely, lonely man (lonely man)

always so unhappy
taking shelter where he can
here i am
come meet a lonely, lonely man (lonely man)


here i am
come meet a lonely, lonely man (lonely man)
