i am just a lonesome cowboy
and i'm travelling all alone
i ain't even got a nickel
to call my baby on the phone


just beyond the mountain lies a city
and i hear it calling me
saddle up and ride, you lonesome cowboy
here is where you'll find your destiny (destiny)

in my dreams the lights shine bright and pretty
near to me and yet so far
will i always be a lonesome cowboy
am i only reaching for a star?
(for a star, for a star, for a star)


ride, ride, ride
(ride along cowboy) cowboy, cowboy
(sing) sing, sing, sing
(sing a song cowboy) cowboy, cowboy


will i ever leave this lonesome valley
really see the lights that shine (shine)
got to find what lies beyond the mountain
got to rope and tie that dream of mine
(dream of mine, dream of mine, that dream of mine)


i am just a lonesome cowboy
and i'm travelling all alone
if you don't call me, baby
then i'm never coming home
then i ain't ever coming home
