all right
i've been thumbing rides travelling light
walking the streets till past midnight
tramping roads, trails and lanes
scaling cliffs fields and plains
searching till the early dawn
for that long legged girl with the short dress on
riding trucks, bikes and skis
sailing lakes and brooks and seas
driving wagons, cars and jeeps
walking stilts in ten foot leaps
searching till the early dawn


for that long legged girl with the short dress on
and everywhere i go she's been and gone
she's fine, it's just too bad she's the travelling kind
so fine, i just can't rest till i make her mine
i've been from maine to tennessee, mexico and waikiki
rain or shine, sleet or snow
searching high, searching low
everything depends upon
