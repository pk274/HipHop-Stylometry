we never got discouraged, we never had a doubt
'cos sooner or later talent must win out
look out broadway, we're coming fast
now we're gonna see our names in lights at last


no more hot dogs at sloppy joe's
we're gonna dine on steak and wine at delmonico's
rich or poor it's great to have dough
that's one thing we know
lots of fun, lots of laughs


signing cheques and contracts and autographs
we're up for n-e-w y-o-r-k
look out, look out broadway
i wanna see all the hustle and bustle
maybe i can get a date with lillian russell


i want to go out with diamond jim
yeah, if he gives you a diamond what will you give to him
blow the trumpets and beat on the drum
big time here we come


no more cheap hotels and one night stands
we'll knock tin pan alley flat on its pans
they'll see that we've got class with a capital k
look out, look out broadway
look out!
