i am not a wise man neither am i a fool
but what i am, the way the good lord made me
though i need you more than you may ever understand
i can't wear a face that will betray me


oh, if you're gonna love me, love the life i lead
need the things i need, don't try to change me
if you're gonna take me, take me for what i am
i can't be another man, i can't be free
'cos the life i lead is the life i lead

need the things i need, don't try to change me
if you're gonna take me, take me for what i am
i can't be another man, i can't be free

oh, if you're gonna love me, love the life i lead
need the things i need, don't try to change me
if you're gonna take me, take me for what i am
i can't be another man, i can't be free
'cos the life i lead is the life i lead


if you're gonna love me, love the life i lead
need the things i need, don't try to change me
if you're gonna take me, take me for what i am
i can't be another man, i can't be free
'cos the life i
