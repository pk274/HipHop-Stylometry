love me tender
love me sweet
never let me go
you have made my life complete
and i love you so


love me tender
love me true
all my dreams fulfilled
for my darling i love you
and i always will


love me tender
love me long
take me to your heart
for it's there that i belong
and we'll never part


love me tender
love me dear
tell me you are mine
i'll be yours through all the years
till the end of time





(when at last my dreams come true
darling this i know
happiness will follow you
everywhere you go)
