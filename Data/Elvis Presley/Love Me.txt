treat me like a fool
treat me mean and cruel, but love me
wring my faithful heart
tear it all apart, but love me (won't you love me)


well, if you ever go
darling, i'll be oh, so lonely
i'll be sad and blue
crying over you, dear only


i would beg and steal (beg and steal)
just to feel (just to feel)
your heart (i want your heart)
beating close to mine (so close to mine)


well, if you ever go
darling, i'll be oh, so lonely
i'll be sad and blue
crying over you, dear only (ooh)


i would beg and steal (he would beg and steal)
just to feel (yes, just to feel)
your heart (i want your heart)
beating close to mine (so close to mine)


well, if you ever go
darling, i'll be oh, so lonely
beggin' on my knees
all i ask is please, please love me
oh yeah
