i used to laugh when i should cry
i used to let these feelings pass me by
but now that i believe them
i got no-one to leave them to me
you see i traded love for what i thought must be free


so i confess my loneliness
and i guess i've lost the best of the year
that i have lost it through my fingers like a golden breath of air
if i cared i wouldn't be singing this love song of the year
i know that time cannot erase the days
love is past and i've gone away
from now on i'll make it very clear


because i don't want to write
another love song of the year
it's a lonely song and not too clear
but to me it's very dear
i guess this song can only be
my feelings went out in the sea of love


to me this has got to be the love song of the year
i know that time cannot erase the days
love is past and i've gone away
from now on i'll make it very clear
because i don't want to write


another love song of the year
i used to laugh i used to cry
i used to laugh, these feelings passed me by
from now on i'll make it very clear because i don't want to write
another love song of the year
