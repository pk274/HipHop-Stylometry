lover doll, oh lover doll (lover doll)
lover doll, lover doll (lover doll)


you're the cutest lover doll
that i ever did ever see
let me tell you lover doll
you were meant, just meant for me
on the first time that i saw you
how i fell for your cuddly charms
lover doll, i'm crazy for you
let me rock you in my arms


i'm so glad i found you
never thought dollies came full grown
i'm gonna tie a ribbon around you
wrap you up and take you home


i would never treat you badly
like a cast-away broken toy
lover doll, i love you madly
let me be your lover boy
