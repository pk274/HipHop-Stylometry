if you could see me now
the one who said that he would rather roam
the one who said he'd rather be alone
if you could only see me now


if i could hold you now
just for a moment, if i could really make you mine
just for a while turn back the hands of time
if i could only hold you now


cause i've been too long in the wind
too long in the rain
taking any comfort that i can
looking back and longing for the freedom of my chains
and lying in your loving arms again


if you could hear me now
singing somewhere in the lonely night
dreaming of the arms that hold me tight
if you could only hear me now




i can almost feel your loving' arms again
