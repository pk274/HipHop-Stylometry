i will spend my whole life through
loving you, just loving you
winter, summer, springtime, too
loving you, loving you

makes no difference where i go or what i do
you know that i'll always be loving you
just you and


if i'm seen with someone new
don't be blue, don't you be blue
i'll be faithful, i'll be true
always true, true to you

there is only one for me and you know who
you know that i'll always be loving you
