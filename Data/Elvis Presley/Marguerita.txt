who makes my heart beat like thunder?
who makes my temperature rise?
who makes me tremble with wonderful rapture
with one burning glance from her eyes


marguerita


once i was free as a gypsy
a creature too wild to tame
then suddenly i saw marguerita
and i was caught like a moth in the flame


marguerita is her name
marguerita


her lips have made me her prisoner
a slave to her every command
she captivates me and intoxicates me
with one little touch of her hand


marguerita
sweet marguerita
sweet, sweet marguerita
