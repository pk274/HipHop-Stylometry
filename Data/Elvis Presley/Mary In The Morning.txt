nothing's quite as pretty as mary in the morning
when through the sleepy haze i see her lying there
soft as the rain that falls on summer flowers
warm as the sunlight shining on her head


when i awake and see her there so close beside me
i want to take her in my arms
the ache is there so deep inside me


nothing's quite as pretty as mary in the morning
chasing the rainbow in her dreams so far away
and when she turns to touch me i kiss her face so softly
and then my mary wakes to love and love again


and mary's there in summer days or stormy weather
she doesn't care how right or wrong the love we share
we share together


nothing's quite as pretty as mary in the evening
kissed by the shade of night and starlight in her hair
and as we walk, i hold her close beside me
all our tomorrows for a lifetime we will share
