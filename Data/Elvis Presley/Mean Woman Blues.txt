i got a woman, mean as she can be
i got a woman, mean as she can be
sometimes i think she's almost mean as me


a black cat up and died of fright
'cause she crossed his path last night
i got a woman, mean as she can be
sometimes i think she's almost mean as me


kissed so hard, she bruise my lips
hurts so good, my heart just flips
i got a woman, mean as she can be
sometimes i think she's almost mean as me


strangest gal i ever had
never happy unless she's mad
i got a woman, mean as she can be
sometimes i think she's almost mean as me

yeah, huh
yeah


she makes love without a smile
ooh, hot dog, it drives me wild
i got a woman, mean as she can be
sometimes i think she's almost mean as me
sometimes i think she's almost mean as me
sometimes i think she's almost mean as me
