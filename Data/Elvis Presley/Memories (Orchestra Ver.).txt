memories, pressed between the pages of my mind
memories, sweetened through the ages just like wine


quiet thoughts come floating down
and settle softly to the ground
like golden autumn leaves around my feet
i touched them and they burst apart with sweet memories
sweet memories


mеmories, pressed bеtween the pages of my mind
memories, sweetened through the ages just like wine
memories, memories


memories, pressed between the pages of my mind
memories, sweetened through the ages just like wine
memories, memories, sweet memories
memories
