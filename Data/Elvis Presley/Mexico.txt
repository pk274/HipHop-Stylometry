mexico, mexico
they've got muchas, mucha-chas, amigos
latin features
never saw such adorable creatures


lots to dig, ooh the nights here
we live it up and love it up amigo
life begins when you're in mexico


you never order water
when you order south of the border
in to kiss a lovely se√±orita


ooh the samba, la bamba
i'll go where you go
life begins when you're in mexico


mexico, mexico
they've got muchas mucha-chas, amigos
never saw such adorable creatures


we live it up and love it up amigo
life begins when you're in mexico
