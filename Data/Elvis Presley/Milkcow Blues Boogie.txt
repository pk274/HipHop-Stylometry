well, i woke up this morning
and i looked out the door
i can tell that old milk cow
by the way she lowed

hold it fellows, that don't move me
let's get real, real gone for a change


well, i woke up this morning
and i looked out the door
i can tell that that old milk cow
i can tell the way she lowed


well, if you've seen my milk cow
please ride her on home
i ain't had no milk or butter
since that cow's been gone


well, i tried to treat you right
day by day
get out your little prayer book
get down on your knees and pray
for you're gonna need
you're gonna need
your loving daddy's help someday
well, then you're gonna be sorry
for treating me this way
oh, let's milk it!
yeah!
well, believe me, don't that sun
look good going down?
well, believe me, don't that sun
look good going down?
well, don't that old moon look lonesome
when your baby's not around


well, i tried everything to
get along with you
i'm gonna tell you what i'm going to do
i'm gonna quit my crying
i'm gonna leave you alone
if you don't believe i'm leaving
you can count the days i'm gone
i'm gonna leave
you're gonna need your
loving daddy's help someday


well, you're gonna be sorry
you treated me this way
