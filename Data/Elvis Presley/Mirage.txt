is your love, darling, just a mirage?
from the distance, you call to me like an oasis
though your kisses keep drawing me near
is your love a mirage that will disappear?


like a man in the desert, i'm lost
is this dream just a trick of my imagination
though i thirst for your lips, night and day
is your love a mirage that will fade away?


how i pray, heaven answered my prayer
when i reach out for you, you'll be there
and the search for my love will be through
like a dream a mirage, will come true
how i pray, heaven answered my prayer
when i reach out for you, you'll be there
in the search for my love will be through
like a dream a mirage, will come true


a mirage, a mirage, a mirage
