well, it's hard to be a gambler
betting' on the number
that changes every time
well, you think you're gonna win
think she's givin' in
a stranger's all you find
yeah, it's hard to figure out
what she's all about
that she's a woman through and through
she's a complicated lady, so color my baby moody blue


oh, moody blue
tell me am i gettin' through
i keep hanging' on
try to learn your song
but i never do
oh, moody blue
tell me who i'm talking' to
you're like night and day
and it's hard to say
which one is you


well, when monday comes she's tuesday
when tuesday comes she's wednesday
into another day again
her personality unwinds
just like a ball of twine
on a spool that never ends
just when i think i know her well
her emotions reveal
she's not the person that
i thought i knew
she's a complicated lady, so color my baby moody blue
