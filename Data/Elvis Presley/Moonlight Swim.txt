let's go on a moonlight swim
far away from the crowd
all alone upon the beach
our lips and our arms
close within each other's reach
we'll be (yes, we'll be)
on a moonlight swim (on a moonlight swim)


let's go on a moonlight swim
to the raft we can race
after just a little while
i'll sit and pretend
that you're on a desert isle
with me on a moonlight swim (on a moonlight swim)


though the air is cold
with kisses, oh, so sweet (so sweet)
i'll keep you warm
so very warm from head to your feet


now let's go on a moonlight swim
we're in love and above
there's a crazy gold balloon
that sits winking down
and inviting us to come on in (come on in)
on a moonlight swim
