yes my baby left me
never said a word
was it something i done
something that she heard?


my baby left me
my baby left me
my baby even left me
never said a word


now i stand at my window
wring my hands and cry
i hate to lose that woman
hate to say goodbye


you know she left me
yes, she left me
my baby even left me
never said a word

baby, one of these mornings
lord, it won't be long
you'll look for me and
baby, and daddy he'll be gone
