you're sleeping son, i know
but, really, this can't wait
i wanted to explain
before it gets too late
for your mother and me
love has finally died
this is no happy home
but god knows how i've tried


because you're all i have, my boy
you are my life, my pride, my joy
and if i stay, i stay because of you, my boy


i know it's hard to understand
why did we ever start?
we're more like strangers now
each acting out a part
i have laughed, i have cried
i have lost every game
taken all i can take
but i'll stay here just the same




sleep on, you haven't heard a word
perhaps it's just as well
why spoil your little dreams
why put you through the hell
life is no fairytale
as one day you will know
but now you're just a child
i'll stay here and watch you grow
