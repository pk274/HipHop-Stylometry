come hear my serenade, my desert serenade
a lover's melody, to bring you close to me
it's a tender lullaby, born of golden sand and sky
the song is new, and it's calling you
tonight beside the desert palms

come let me take you in my arms
come hear my serenade, my desert serenade


wherever lovers dwell, it weaves its magic spell
soon a thousand dreams will start
and romance will fill your heart
my lips conceal love that's warm and real


give me the chance to hold you near
you'll see a brand new world appear
so come and hear, my desert serenade, my desert serenade
my desert serenade
