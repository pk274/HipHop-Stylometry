my warped and worried mind resorts
to wandering off to ponder things i never talk about
a pretty girl i used to know
but wouldn't know if we met face to face
and defying every logic known
i wish the time machine could take me back again
to the wonder of my first love, the old folks teased me 'bout
referring to her only as my little friend


somewhere far away and maybe not so far away
a child has grown into a woman of the world
i assume this knowing that she knew so much of life
at such a tender age
i learned from her the whispered things
the big boys at the pool hall talked about
the thrill and disappointment
fear and shame that first love brings
but oh, how i thought i loved my little friend


the fragrance of the green grass
mingled with the scent of love and warming earth
that moonlight night i kissed and cried
and swore i'd never touch another girl
but time moved fast and i moved on
and i loved others time and time again
but with each time i thought of her
and always gave a little more
assembled love, remembrance for my little friend


oh-oh-oh assembled love, remembrance for my little friend
oh-oh-oh assembled love, remembrance for my little friend
oh-oh-oh assembled love, remembrance for my little friend
