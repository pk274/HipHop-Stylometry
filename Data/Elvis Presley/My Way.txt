and now the end is near
so i face the final curtain
my friend, i'll say it clear
i'll state my case of which i'm certain


i've lived a life that's full
i've traveled each and every highway
and more, much more than this
i did it my way


regrets, i've had a few
but then again, too few to mention
i did what i had to do
and saw it through without exception


i planned each charted course
each careful step along the byway
oh, and more, much more than this
i did it my way


yes, there were times, i'm sure you knew
when i bit off more than i could chew
but through it all when there was doubt
i ate it up and spit it out
i faced it all and i stood tall
and did it my way


i've loved, i've laughed and cried
i've had my fill, my share of losing
and now as tears subside
i find it all so amusing
to think i did all that
and may i say, not in a shy way
oh, no, no not me
i did it my way


for what is a man, what has he got
if not himself, then he has not
to say the words he truly feels
and not the words of one who kneels
the record shows i took the blows
and did it my way
the record shows i took the blows
and did it my way
