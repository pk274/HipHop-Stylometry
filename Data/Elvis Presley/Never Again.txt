i hope i never ever love anyone this much again
i can't take it anymore
i've been hurt before
never ever quite like this time


what will become of me when you're no longer here?
if i can't stop loving you
what am i to do?
you'll be free but where will i be?


now that i'm used to love, how can i stand alone?
now that love has come and gone
like the ending of a song
a song my lonely heart keeps singing


where do i go from here? will i get over you?
if so, next time i'll be smart
i'll know before i start
a heart that don't care, don't get broken


i hope i never ever love anyone this much again
never ever, never again, never again
