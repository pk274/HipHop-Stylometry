walk down to the beach at sunset
look as far as you can see
you will find that endless ocean
and that's how my love will always be (on and on and on)


i bring you never ending, never ending
never ending, never ending
never ending, never ending love
(it goes on and on)


look up at the sky at midnight
gaze up on the starlit view
just as heaven has no boundaries
neither does my love for you (on and on and on)


i bring you never ending, never ending
never ending, never ending
never ending, never ending love
(it goes on and on)


never ending love (it goes on and on)
never ending love (it goes on and on)
never ending love (it goes on and on)
never ending love
