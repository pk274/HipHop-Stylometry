look out now, i'm running wild
there ain't no holding back this child
i guess you'd say i'm a son of a gun
living just for a life of fun


life has taught me one big lesson
always keep the girl's guessing
tell them that you love them so
you hate to leave but you got to go


it's the oldest game in the world
and you got to know how to play it
tell her yes in so many ways
but never ever say it


and that's how i keep going on
here today, tomorrow gone
that's the kind of life for me
being free like i want to be




now that's how i keep going on
here today, tomorrow gone
and that's the kind of life for me
being free like i want to be


here's the secret of my success
never say yes, no, no, never say yes
no, no, never say yes
