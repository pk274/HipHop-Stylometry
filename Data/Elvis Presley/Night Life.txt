oh, the neons are a-gleaming and the gamblers are a-dreaming
oh, it's night life, yeah, night life
the chips are a-spilling and it's time to make a killing
oh, it's night life, yeah! night life

oh the pockets are a-burning and the money flies
if the dice roll a-turning and you hit snakes eyes
you can't be a quitter when you're caught up in the glitter of
night life, night life


there're long legged women who will take you for a trimming
yes it's night life, oh night life
their lips taste like honey but they're out to spend your money
yes it's night life. oh yeah!

just roll that seven and you'll hear them shriek
when seven come eleven it's a lucky streak
you can't beat the drama, the excitement and the glamour
of the night life, i said that night life


so place your bet, come on make your play
though you may regret it at the break of day
i said you can't be a quitter when you're caught up in the glitter
of the night life night life
yeah! that night life, good old night life
night life, yes, yes, night life, oh night life
