midnight's prayers so softly whispered in
a cathedral's candle light
bring the message of the holidays
on a snowy christmas night

holly reeds and hidden mistletoe
symbols of the season's might
joyful faces everywhere you go
on a snowy christmas night


give thanks for all you've been blessed with
and hold your loved ones tight
for you know the lord's been good to you
on a snowy christmas night


mother nature wears a bridal gown
for the world is dressed in white
there's a silent glow that fills the earth
on a snowy christmas night


give thanks for all you've been blessed with
and hold your loved ones tight
for you know the lord's been good to you
on a snowy christmas night


for you know the lord's been good to you
on a snowy christmas night
