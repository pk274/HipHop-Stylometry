all you got is one life
living once can be rough
but if you live every day all the way
once is enough


you can own just one suit
worn and torn at the cuff
but if you're living the life that you love
once is enough


what's the good of reaching 90
if you waste 89?
you got one life so live it
if you don't, it's a crime


life's a playful puppy
you can grab by the scruff
and if you live every sec, what the heck
once is enough


never wait until tomorrow
what if it never comes?
life is a seven layer
don't you settle for crumbs


life's a playful puppy
you can grab by the scruff
and if you live every sec, what the heck
once is enough


and if you live every sec, what the heck
once is enough
and if you live every sec, what the heck
once is enough
