one boy, two little girls
three hearts yearning for love
although it's hard to explain
i know it may sound insane
but this one boy loves two little girls


folks say three is a crowd
to each boy, one girl's allowed
but right now i'm having such fun
i just can't give up either one
'cause this one boy loves two little girls


there will come a time, i'll have to settle down
but until that time, i love two girls hanging around


now one day i must decide
which one i'll choose for my bride
but until we three must part
i've twice as much love in my heart
'cause this one boy loves two little girls
