one night with you
is what i'm now praying for
the things that we two could plan
would make my dreams come true


just call my name
and i'll be right by your side
i want your sweet helping hand
my love's too strong to hide


always lived, very quiet life
i ain't never did no wrong
now i know that life without you
has been too lonely too long

is what i'm now praying for
the things that we two could plan
would make my dreams come true
