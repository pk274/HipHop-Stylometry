just like an old grandfather's clock that won't stop running
like an old racehorse that just won't ever quit


there'll be no end to loving you
nothing can stop me once i start
'cause i've a one track mind and a one track heart


well, i'm as stubborn as a mule, i just won't let up
like an old bloodhound, i'll hang around your trail


there'll be no end to loving you
don't try to stop me if you're smart
'cause i've a one track mind and a one track heart


ooh-ee, there'll be no turning back
ooh-ee, i'm gonna stay on your track


just like a choo-choo train that's gotta keep a-chugging
you'll find that i'm the kind who sticks to what i do


there'll be no end to loving you
baby, we'll never be apart
'cause i've a one track mind and a one track heart


just like a choo-choo train that's gotta keep a-chugging
you'll find that i'm the kind who sticks to what i do


there'll be no end to loving you
baby, we'll never be apart
'cause i'm a one track mind and a one track heart
