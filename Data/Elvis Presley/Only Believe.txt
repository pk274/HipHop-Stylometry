lordy, only believe, only believe
all things are possible if you'll only believe
my lordy, only believe, yes, only believe
all things are possible, if you'll only believe


i met god one morning, my soul feeling bad
heart heavy laden, i had a bowed down head
well, he lifted all my burdens
yeah, right now i'm feeling glad
all things are possible, if you'll only believe


i believe, yeah, i believe
all things are possible, if you'll only believe
