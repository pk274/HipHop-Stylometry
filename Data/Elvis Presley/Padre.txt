the day that we wed
you blessed us and said
"may heaven bestow you grace"
there in that holy place
we shared our first embrace

our cottage was small
but richer than all
the palaces of the king
all day the birds would sing
our hearts were filled with spring


padre, padre
what happened to our love so cruel?
padre, oh padre
in my grief i turn to you


then he came along
and sang her his song
and won her with honey lies
he of the fiery eyes
now it's not her that cries

so i kneel and pray
the hours away
and weary my heart has grown
wondering where love has flown
counting my beads alone


padre, oh padre
please tell me how such things can be
padre, oh padre
pray for my love and me
