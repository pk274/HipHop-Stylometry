when you looked into my eyes
i stood there like i was hypnotized
you sent a feeling to my spine
a feelin' warm and smooth and fine
but all i could do was stand there paralyzed

when we kissed, ooh what a thrill
you took my hand and, ooh baby, what a chill
i felt like grabbing you real tight
squeeze and squeeze with all my might
but all i could do was stand there paralyzed


oh yeah lucky me, i'm singing every day, ooh
ever since that day you came my way, ooh
you made my life for me just one big happy game
i'm gay every morning, at night i'm still the same

well, do you remember that wonderful time
you held my hand and swore that you'd be mine
in front of preacher you said "i do"
i couldn't say a word for thinking of you
all i could do was stand there paralyzed


oh yeah lucky me, i'm singing every day, ooh
ever since that day you came my way, ooh
you made my life for me just one big happy game
i'm gay every morning, at night i'm still the same

well child, do you remember that wonderful time
when you held my hand and swore that you'd be mine
in front of preacher you said "i do"
i couldn't say a word for thinking of you
all i could do was stand there paralyzed
all i could do was stand there paralyzed
