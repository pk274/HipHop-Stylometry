we've got to patch it up baby
before we fall apart at the seams
we've got to patch it up baby
we can't let time unravel our dreams
let's go back and touch the past
one more night is all i ask
get that feeling, that old feeling, feelin-eelin'


we can patch it up baby
we can patch it up baby
we can patch it up baby
patch it up with a whole lotta' love

we got to patch it up baby
let's sweep out all the cobwebs in our hearts
we've got to patch it up baby
before indifference pulls us apart
don't let a good love die
lets give it just one more try
with that feeling, that old feeling, feelin-eelin'
