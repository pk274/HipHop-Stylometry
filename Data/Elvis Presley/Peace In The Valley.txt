oh well, i'm tired and so weary
but i must go alone
till the lord comes and calls, calls me away, oh yes
well the morning's so bright
and the lamp is alight
and the night, night is as black as the sea, oh yes


there will be peace in the valley for me, someday
there will be peace in the valley for me, oh lord i pray
there'll be no sadness, no sorrow
no trouble, trouble i see
there will be peace in the valley for me, for me


well the bear will be gentle
and the wolves will be tame
and the lion shall lay down by the lamb, oh yes
and the beasts from the wild
shall be lit by a child
and i'll be changed, changed from this creature that i am, oh yes


there will be peace in the valley for me, some day
there will be peace in the valley for me, oh lord i pray
there'll be no sadness, no sorrow
no trouble, trouble i see
there will be peace in the valley for me, for me
