a water glass full of whiskey
women that i never knew too well
lord, the things i've seen and done
most of which i'd be ashamed to tell


i don't know how it started
but that's what makes a man a man, i guess
now i'm holding on to nothing
trying to forget the rest


i'm looking back on my life
to see if i can find the pieces
i know that some were stolen
and some just blew away
well, i found the bad parts
found all the sad parts
but i guess i threw the best parts away
lord away, away


playin' the bars, playin' like a star
anything to get a name
carryin' on, livin' on songs
my friends wrote for me to sing


i'm looking back on my life
to see if i can find the pieces
i know that some were stolen
and some just blew away
well, i found the bad parts
found all the sad parts
but i guess i threw the best parts away
away, away


lord, the pieces of my life
they're everywhere, they're everywhere
and the one i think i miss most of all
is you and you know who
looking back on my life, lord
to see if i find the pieces
looking back on my life today
to see if i can find the pieces
looking back on my life
god, help me find the pieces
