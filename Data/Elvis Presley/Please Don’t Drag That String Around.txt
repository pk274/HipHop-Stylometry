so i beg you
please don't drag that string around, oh no
well, what if it should break
oh, tell me, what would i do then
keep that string up off the ground
ooh yeah, remember my heart is tied to the other end

yes, i'm your puppet
my heart is in your hand
one twist of the wrist
and i'll jump to your command


so i beg you
please don't drag that string around, oh no
well, what if it should break
what would i do then?
baby, keep that string up off the ground
oh yeah, remember my heart is tied to the other end

i feel inside me
as sure as anything
one day i'll mean more to you
than a puppet on a string


so i beg you
please don't drag that string around, oh no
well, what if it should break
oh, tell me, what would i do then
baby, keep that string up off the ground
oh yeah, remember my heart is tied to the other end
