i don't worry
whenever skies are gray above
got a pocketful of rainbows
got a heart full of love

mister heartache
i've found a way to make him leave
got a pocketful of rainbows
got a star up in my sleeve


kiss me extra tender
hold me extra tight
'cause i'm saving your sweetness
for a lonely night, aye
aye, aye, aye, aye, aye, aye, aye, aye


no more teardrops
now that i've found a love so true
i got a pocketful of rainbows
got an armful of you


kiss me extra tender
hold me extra tight
'cause i'm saving your sweetness
for a lonely night, aye
aye, aye, aye, aye, aye, aye, aye, aye


no more heartaches
now that i've found a love so true
got a pocketful of rainbows
and an armful of you


rainbows
rainbows
