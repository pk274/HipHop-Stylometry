hail to thee old ivy league
poison ivy league


the ra-ra boys are sitting 'round the tables tonight
the ra-ra boys have lots of plans in view
they're gonna have panty raids
and make their own lemonade
they'll live it up just like the big boys do


the ra-ra boys will go to bed so early tonight
before exams they need a lot of rest
they gotta make good for dad
they gotta make good so bad
they'll even pay someone to take that test


the ra-ra boys are being groomed for business someday
for better things to college, they were sent
and you can bet they'll be the head of the company
as long as dear old daddy's president


so let it be told
i won't touch them with a ten foot pole
that poison ivy league
