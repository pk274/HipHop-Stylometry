what are you lookin' at back there?
some of y'all never been down south too much
i'm gonna tell you a little story so's you'll understand what i'm talkin' about
down there, we have a plant that grows out in the woods and the fields
and it looks somethin' like a turnip green
and everybody calls it polk salad
now that's polk salad, ho
anyway, i used to know a girl who lived down there
she'd go out in the evenings and pick her a mess of it
carry it home and cook it for supper
'cause that's about all they had to eat
but they did alright


down in louisiana
where the alligators grow so mean
lived a girl that i swear to the world
made the alligators look tame


polk salad annie
gators got your granny
everybody said it was a shame
'cause her mama was a-workin' on the chain gang


a mean, vicious
straight-razor-totin' woman
lord, have mercy


every day before suppertime
she'd go down by the truck patch
and pick her a mess of polk salad
and carry it home in a tow sack


polk salad annie
gators got your granny
everybody said it was a shame
'cause her mama was a-workin' on the chain gang


sock a little polk salad (oh)


her daddy was a lazy no-count
claimed he had a bad back
all her brothers were fit for
was stealin' watermelons out of my truck patch


polk salad annie
gators got your granny
everybody said it was a shame
'cause her mama was a-workin' on the chain gang


sock a little polk salad to me
you know i need a
sock a little


yeah
you're right, you're right
sock a little polk salad to me
you know i need a real mess of it
sock a little
know i need a real mess of it
sock a little, sock a


thank you
