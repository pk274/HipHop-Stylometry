they call me poor boy, poor boy, poor boy
but i ain't lonesome and i ain't blue
'cause i could never be a poor boy
as long as i've got a dolly like you


ain't got a crust, ain't got a cent
can't buy a jug, can't pay the rent
i got a heart full of dreams and a lot of memories
and that's enough for me


they call me poor boy, poor boy, poor boy
but i ain't lonesome and i ain't blue
'cause i could never be a poor boy
as long as i've got a dolly like you


can't buy a house, can't buy a lot
ain't got a bean, ain't got a pot
but what i got is a heart full of love and memories
and that's enough for me


they call me poor boy, poor boy, poor boy
but i ain't lonesome and i ain't blue
i've got a dolly like you
as long as i've got a dolly like you


don't have a pig, don't have a cow
i don't have a horse to pull a plow
but what i got is a heart full of love and memories
and that's enough for me


they call me poor boy, poor boy, poor boy
but i ain't lonesome and i ain't blue
'cause i could never be a poor boy
i've got a dolly like
i've got a dolly like
i've got a dolly like you
