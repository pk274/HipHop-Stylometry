twist it, turn it, you can't tear it down

by the strength and mighty power of my love

i know baby you can't lick it
i'll make you give in
every minute, every hour you'll be shaken
by the strength and mighty power of my love


baby i want you, you'll never get away
my love will haunt you yes haunt you night and day
touch it, pound it, what good does it do
there's just no stopping' the way i feel for you
cos' every minute, every hour you'll be shaken
by the strength and mighty power of my love


yeh, yeh, baby i want you, you'll never get away
my love will haunt you yes haunt you night and day
touch it, pound it, what good does it do
there's just no stopping' the way i feel for you
cos' every minute, every hour you'll be shaken
by the strength and mighty power of my love


i said every minute, every hour you'll be shaken
by the strength and mighty power of my love
