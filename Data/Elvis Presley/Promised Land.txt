oh, get on up!


i left my home in norfolk, virginia
california on my mind
i straddled that greyhound and rode him into raleigh
and on across caroline


we had motor trouble that turned into a struggle
halfway across alabam'
and that 'hound broke down and left us all stranded
in downtown birmingham


right away i bought me a through train ticket
riding across mississippi clean
i was on that midnight flyer out of birmingham
smoking into new orleans


somebody help me get out of louisiana
just help me get to houston town
there are people there who care a little about me
and they won't let the poor boy down


sure as you're born, they bought me a silk suit
and put luggage in my hand
and i woke up high over albuquerque
on a jet to the promised land


a-workin' on a t-bone, steak a la carte
flying over to the golden state
when the pilot told us in thirteen minutes
he would set us at the terminal gate


swing low chariot, come down easy
taxi to the terminal zone
cut your engines and cool your wings
and let me make it to the telephone
los angeles, give me norfolk, virginia
tidewater four-ten-o-nine
tell the folks back home this is the promised land calling
and the poor boy is on the line
