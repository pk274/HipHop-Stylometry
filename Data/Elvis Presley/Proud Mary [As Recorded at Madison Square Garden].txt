left a good job in the city
working for the man every night and day
haven't ever lost one minute of sleeping
worried about the way things might have been


a big wheel keep on turning
proud mary keep on b-b-b-burning
rolling, rolling, rollin on a river
rollin, rollin, rollin on a river

cleaned a lot of plates in memphis
pumped a lot of 'pane down in new orleans
but i never saw the good side of the city
'til i hitched a ride on a river boat queen


if you come down to the river
i betcha you're going to find some people who live
you don't have to worry
because you have no money
people along the river are happy to give
