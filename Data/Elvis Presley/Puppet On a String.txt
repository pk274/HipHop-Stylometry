every time you look at me
i'm as helpless as can be
i become a puppet on a string
you can do 'most anything with me

all you do is touch my hand
and your wish is my command
i become a puppet on a string
you can do 'most anything with me


if you really love me
darling please be kind
i'll offer you the truest love
that you will ever find


take my heart and please be fair
handle it with loving care
for i'm just a puppet on a string
you can do 'most anything with me




take my heart and please be fair
handle it with loving care
for i'm just a puppet on a string
you can do 'most anything with me
you can do 'most anything with me
