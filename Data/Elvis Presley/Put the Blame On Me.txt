if they say we were doing wrong
if they say we were out too long
well, you can say my arms were just too strong
put the blame, put the blame on me


felt so good when i held you tight
couldn't stop when we kissed goodnight
so if they tell us we don't have the right
put the blame, put the blame on me


what i feel is deep inside
this is real and i won't hide
go ahead and use my name
i'll be proud to take the blame


you just did what i made you do
you love me and i love you too
so if the way they talk can bother you
put the blame, put the blame on me


what i feel is deep inside
this is real and i won't hide
go ahead and use my name
i'll be proud to take the blame


you just did what i made you do
you love me and i love you too
so if the way they talk can bother you
put the blame, put the blame on me

put the blame on me, oh
