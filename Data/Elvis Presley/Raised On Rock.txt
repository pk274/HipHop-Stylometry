i remember as a child i used to hear
music that they played lord with a feel
some call it folk, some call it soul
but people let me tell you it was rock and roll

i was raised on rock, i got rhythm in my soul
every day when i got home i turned on my radio


listening to the music that my idols made
i knew every single record the dj's played
a honky tonk a hound dog, a johnny b. goode
chain gang, love is strange, knock on wood

i was raised on rock, i got rhythm in my soul
i was born to love the beat, i was made for rock and roll


some thought it was a fad, thought that it would pass
but the younger generation knew it would last
time's gone by, the beat goes on
but every time i hear it, lord, it takes me home

i was raised on rock, i got rhythm in my soul
every day when i got home i turned on my radio


mother played recordings of beethoven's fifth
mozart's sonatas down the classical liszt
my papa loved to listen to those country songs
while i was in the back room rocking on

i was raised on rock, i got rhythm in my soul
i was born to love the beat, i was made for rock and roll


i was raised on rock, i got rhythm in my soul
i was born to love the beat, i was made for rock and roll
i was raised on rock, i got rhythm in my
soul
