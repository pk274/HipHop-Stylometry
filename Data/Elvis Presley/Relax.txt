relax, kick your shoes off, baby
relax, here we are alone
relax, if the phone rings, let it
just forget it, we're not at home

let loose, let your hair down, honey
unwind, turn the lights down low
relax, let's uncork the stopper
come to papa, come on, let's go


defrost your charms
there's only the two of us here
come in my arms
and make yourself comfortable, dear


relax, let's get cozy, baby
come on, even concrete cracks
cut loose, when the knock's invited
don't you fight it, come on, relax


defrost your charms
there's only the two of us here
come in my arms
and make yourself comfortable, dear


relax, let's get cozy, baby
come on, even concrete cracks
cut loose, life is worth the livin'
when you're givin', come on, relax


relax, mmm
let loose, mmm
defrost, mmm
mmm
