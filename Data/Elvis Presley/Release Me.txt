oh, please release me, let me go
for i just don't love you anymore
to waste our lives would be a sin
oh, release me and let me love again


oh, i have found a new love dear
and i will always want her near
her lips are warm while yours are cold
oh, release me, my darling let me go

 
let me go
oh, release me
my darling, let me go
let me go, let me go
