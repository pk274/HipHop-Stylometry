return to sender


i gave a letter to the postman
he put it in his sack
bright and early next morning
he brought my letter back


(she wrote upon it)
return to sender
address unknown
no such number
no such zone
we had a quarrel
a lover's spat
i write, "i'm sorry"
but my letter keeps coming back


so then i dropped it in the mailbox
and sent it special d
bright and early next morning
it came right back to me


(she wrote upon it)
return to sender
address unknown
no such person
no such zone


this time, i'm gonna take it myself
and put it right in her hand
and if it comes back the very next day
then i'll understand


(the writing on it)
return to sender
address unknown
no such number
no such zone
