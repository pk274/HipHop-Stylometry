i'm riding the rainbow
hitting the highway to happiness
oh yes, i'm looking to find
someone whose meant to be mine


(i'm living to love) i'm living to love
(and loving to live) and loving to live
(i've got a heart) i've got a heart
(i'm longing to give) i'm longing to give

(oh) i'm riding the rainbow
i'll follow that star to where you are


i'm riding the rainbow
heading for heaven and happiness
i guess somebody somewhere
someday will teach me to care


(but being alone) but being alone
(don't bother me) don't bother me
(i'm free to have fun) i'm free to have fun
(it's fun to be free) it's fun to be free


(i'm riding the rainbow)
(i'll follow that star)
(oh) i'm riding the rainbow
to where you are
