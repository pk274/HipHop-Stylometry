well, it's saturday night and i just got paid
a fool about my money, don't try to save
my heart says go, go, have a time
'cause it's saturday night, babe, and i'm feeling' fine


i'm gonna rock it up
i'm gonna rip it up
i'm gonna shake it up
gonna ball it up
i'm gonna rip it up
have a ball tonight


well, i got me a date and i won't be late
i picked her up in my '88'
shag on down to the social hall
when the music starts jumpin', i'll have a ball


i'm gonna rock it up
i'm gonna shake it up
i'm gonna rip it up
gonna ball it up
i'm gonna rip it up
and ball tonight


along about ten i'll be flying high
i'll walk on out into open sky
but i don't care if i spend my dough
'cause tonight i'm gonna be one happy soul


i'm gonna rock it up
i'm gonna rip it up
i'm gonna shake it up
gonna ball it up
i'm gonna rip it up
have a ball tonight


well, it's saturday night and i just got paid
a fool about my money, don't try to save
my heart says go, go, have a time
'cause it's saturday night, babe, and i'm feeling' fine


i'm gonna rock it up
i'm gonna rip it up
i'm gonna shake it up
gonna ball it up
i'm gonna rip it up
and a ball tonight
