the way she moves her hips up to her fingertips
i feel i'm heaven bound
and when she starts to sway, i've gotta say
she really moves the grass around


rock-a-hula baby
rock-a-hula baby
got a hula lulu from honolulu
that rock-a-hula baby of mine


although i love to kiss my little hula miss
i never get the chance
i wanna hold her tight all through the night
but all she wants to do is dance


rock-a-hula baby
rock-a-hula baby
got a hula lulu from honolulu
that rock-a-hula baby of mine

rock-a-hula baby
rock-a-hula baby
rock-a-hula baby
rock, rock, rock, rock


rock-a-hula baby
rock-a-hula baby
got a hula lulu from honolulu
that rock-a-hula baby of mine
oh well, that rock-a-hula baby of mine
