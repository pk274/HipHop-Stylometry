i'm just a roustabout
shifting from town to town
no job can hold me down
i'm just a knock-around guy
there's a lot of space beneath that sky
till i find my place, there's no doubt
i'll be a rovin' roustabout


call me the carefree kind
i wander with the breeze
my mind and heart's at ease
doing what pleases me best
gotta keep-a movin' east or west (east or west, east or west)
till i find my place, there's no doubt (no doubt)
i'll be a rovin' roustabout


and even if a pretty girl should catch my eye
i'll give her a quick "hello" and a fast goodbye


i'll go the way i want
driftin' just like the sand
doin' what job i can
changing my plans as i choose
long as i keep happy i can't lose (can't lose)
till i find my place, there's no doubt
i'll be a rovin' roustabout


i'll be a rovin' roustabout
i'll be a rovin' roustabout
rovin', rovin', rovin' roustabout
i'll be a rovin' roustabout
