well, you may run on for a long time
(run along for a long time)
run on for a long time
let me tell you god almighty gonna cut you down


go tell that long tongued liar (oh well well)
go tell that midnight rider (oh well well)
tell the gambler, the rambler, the back-biter
tell them god almighty gonna cut 'em down


stop god almighty let me tell you the news
my head's been wet with the midnight dews
i've been down on my bended knees
talking to the man from galilee

my god spoke and he spoke so sweet
i thought i heard the shuffle of angel's feet
he put one hand upon my head
great god almighty, let me tell you what he said


go tell that long tongued liar (oh well well)
go tell that midnight rider (oh well well)
tell the gambler, the rambler, the back-biter
tell them god almighty gonna cut 'em down


well, you may run on for a long time
(run along for a long time)
run on for a long time
let me tell you god almighty gonna cut you down


you may throw your rock and hide your hand
working in the dark 'gainst your fellow man
as sure as god made the day and the night
what you do in the dark will be brought to the light

you may run and hide, slip and slide
trying to take the mote from your neighbor’s eye
as sure as god made the rich and poor
you going to reap just what you sow


you may run on for a long time
(run along for a long time)
run on for a long time
let me tell you god almighty's gonna cut you down


go tell that long tongued liar (oh well well)
go tell that midnight rider (oh well well)
tell the gambler, the rambler, the back-biter
(tell them god almighty gonna cut 'em down)


some people go to church just to sit in the fire
trying to make a date with the neighbor’s wife
brother let me tell you as sure as you're born
you better leave that woman alone

because one of these days, mark my word
you think that brother is going to work
and you'll sneak up and knock on that door
that's all, brother, you'll knock no more


run on for a long time
(run along for a long time)
run on for a long time
let me tell you god almighty's gonna cut you down


go tell that long tongued liar (oh well well)
go tell that midnight rider (oh well well)
tell the gambler, the rambler, the back-biter
(tell them god almighty gonna cut 'em down)
