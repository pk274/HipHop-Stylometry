as i walk along, i wonder
what went wrong with our love
our love that was so strong

and as i still walk by
i think off the times we've had together
while our hearts were young


i'm a-walking in the rain
hear it falling and i feel the pain
wishing you were here by me
to end this misery


and i wonder
(i, i, i, i wonder)
yo, baby
why?
(why? why? why? why? why?)


you went away
and i wonder where you will stay
my little runaway
run, run, run, run, runaway






you went away and i wonder where you will stay
my little runaway
run, run, run, run, runaway
run, run, run, run, runaway
run, run, run, run, runaway
