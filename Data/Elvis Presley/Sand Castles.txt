at night
when the sky is still
when the south wind blows
and the air is warm
there's a world that's born


and for every child on the beach that day
stands a castle tall and proud
and the warm wind crawls through the castle walls
and the night folk wakes as the warm wind calls




then the fiddler crab plays his violin
on the back of a dancing whale
while the mermaids sing to the shell they bring
and the dragon leads with his sweeping tail




for the rosy dawn
brings the children on to a beach that's bright and new
and the night folk know as the castles grow
they will play once more as the children do
