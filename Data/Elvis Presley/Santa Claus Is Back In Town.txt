(christmas, christmas, christmas)
well, it's christmas time, pretty baby
and the snow is falling on the ground
(christmas, christmas)
well, it's christmas time, pretty baby
and the snow is falling down
(christmas, christmas)
well, you be a real good little girl
santa claus is back in town
(christmas, christmas)

got no sleigh with reindeer
no sack on my back
you're gonna see me comin'
in a big black cadillac


oh, it's christmas time, pretty baby (christmas, christmas)
and the snow is falling on the ground (christmas, christmas)
well you be a real good little baby
santa claus is back in town
(christmas, christmas)
(christmas, christmas)
(christmas)


hang up your pretty stockings
turn off the light
santa claus is comin'
down your chimney tonight


oh, it's christmas time, pretty baby (christmas, christmas)
and the snow is falling on the ground (christmas, christmas)
well, you be a real good little baby
santa claus is back in town
(christmas, christmas)
