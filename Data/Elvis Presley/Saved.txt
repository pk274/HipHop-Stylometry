i wanna soothe my my heart, i wanna ease my mind
i wanna move my shoes and see what i can find
i wanna stand up tall and open up my eyes
i wanna reach out my hand until i touch the skies
i was a poor lost lamb in a deep dark hole


but now i've found that light i'm gonna save my soul
i used to drink, i used to smoke
i used to smoke, drink and dance the hoochy-coo
i used to smoke and drink, smoke and drink and dance the hoochy-coo
oh yeah and now i'm standing on this corner praying for me and you


i-i-i that's why i'm saved i'm saved
people let me tell you 'bout kingdom come
you know i'm saved i'm saved
well i can preach until you're deaf and dumb
i'm in that soul-saving army beating on that big bass drum


i used to cuss, i used to fuss
i used to fuss, cuss, boogie all night long
i used to cuss and fuss, cuss and fuss
cuss and fuss and boogie all night long
well, now i'm standing on this corner, i know right from wrong


i-i-i that's why i'm saved i'm saved
people let me tell you 'bout kingdom come
you know i'm saved i'm saved
well i can preach until you're deaf and dumb
i'm in that soul-saving army beating on that big bass drum


i used to lie, i used to cheat
i used to lie, cheat, steal from people's feet
i used to lie and cheat, lie and cheat and steal from people's feet
well, now i'm stepping on to glory salvation in my beat


because i'm saved, i'm saved
people let me tell you 'bout kingdom come
i am saved i'm saved
well, i can preach until you're deaf and dumb
i'm in that soul-saving army beating on that big bass drum


i'm in that soul-saving army beating on that big bass drum
oh yeah, because i'm saved, i'm saved
people let me tell you 'bout kingdom come
you know i'm saved i'm saved
well, i can preach until you're deaf and dumb
i'm saved, i'm saved i'm saved
