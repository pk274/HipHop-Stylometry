one good turn deserves another
be my love, i'll be your lover
it's all part of nature's laws
if you'll scratch my back then i'll scratch yours


if you'll scratch my back then i'll scratch your back
like two peas in a pack, let's get rid of our itch together, hmm


joy they say is in the givin'
come on give, make life worth livin'
your welfare is my concern
do a favor for me, i'll do one in return


if you'll scratch my back then i'll scratch your back
like two peas in a pack, let's get rid of our itch together, hmm


scratch me now a little lower
what a feeling, do it slower
that's it, hmm you're gettin' hot
well i got to admit, you just hit the spot


if you'll scratch my back then i'll scratch your back
like two peas in a pack, let's get rid of our itch together, hmm
