every time i see the sun rise
or a mountain that's so high
just by seeing is believing
i don't need to question why
when i see a mighty ocean
that rushes to the shore


if i ever had cause to doubt him
i don't doubt him anymore
oh seeing, seeing, seeing is believing
and i see him everywhere
in the mountains, in the valley
yes i know my god is there
oh, in time i look above me
see the stars that fill the sky
how could there be any question
only god can reach that high
