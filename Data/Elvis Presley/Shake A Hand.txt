just leave it to me
don't ever be ashamed
just give me a chance
i'll take care of everything


your troubles i'll share
let me know and i'll be there
i'll take care of you
anyplace and anywhere


shake a hand, shake a hand
shake a hand if you can


be truthful to me
i'll be truthful to you
i'm in love with you so
till i don't know what to do


so, let's call it a day
i've said all i have to say
except don't forget to pray
and shake a hand every day
