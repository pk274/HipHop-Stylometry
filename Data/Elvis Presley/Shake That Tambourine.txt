shake the little tambourine
shake a-ring a jing -jing a-ling
shake, shake my little dancing queen
shake that tambourine, that tambourine


i can hear them dancing, in the marketplace
swishing and a-swirling, in their silks and lace
bracelets keep a-clinking, on their tiny feet
and with their tambourines they keep the beat


rings on their fingers, bells on their toes
they make music, wherever they go
pound that little drum now, tap on it with your thumb




i heard their talent open palace doors
every night they're dancing, on those marble floors
kings may bow before them, but they'll be my own
then they'll shake their thing for me alone
