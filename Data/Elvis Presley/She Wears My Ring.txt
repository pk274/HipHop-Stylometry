she wears my ring to show the world that she belongs to me
she wears my ring to show the world she's mine eternally
with loving care i placed it on her finger
to show my love for all the world to see


this tiny ring is a token of tender emotion
an endless pool of love that's as deep as the ocean
she swears to wear it with eternal devotion
that's why i sing, because she wears my ring


she swears to wear it with eternal devotion
that's why i sing, because she wears my ring



that's why i sing, because she wears my ring
