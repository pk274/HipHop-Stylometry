well she's a
earth quaking, hip shaking, soul breaking, love making
machine, hey hey!!
she's a mad stalking, smooth talking, slow walking cat
you know what i mean, hey hey!!


she'll wrap those arms around you
like a grizzly bear
she'll kiss you every fifteen minutes
and lets you up for air


well she's a
wild moving, smooth grooving, clock ticking, love making
machine, hey hey!!
she's a real breezing, rough squeezing, hell teasing cat
you know what i mean, hey hey!!


she'll leer and make you like it
sweet as she can be
she'll make you blow your mind before
you count to one-two-three
