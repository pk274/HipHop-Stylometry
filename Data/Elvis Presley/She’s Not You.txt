her hair is soft
and her eyes are oh so blue
she's all the things a girl should be
but she's not you

she knows just how to make me laugh
when i feel blue
she's everything a man could want
but she's not you


and when we're dancing
it almost feels the same
i've got to stop myself from
whispering your name


she even kisses me like
you used to do
and it's just breaking my heart
'cause she's not you


and it's just breaking my heart
'cause she's not you


and when we're dancing
it almost feels the same
i've gotta stop myself from
whispering your name


she even kisses me like
you used to do
and it's just breaking my heart
because she's not you


and it's just breaking my heart
'cause she's not you
