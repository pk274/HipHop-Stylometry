silver bells, silver bells
its christmas time in the city
ring-a-ling, hear them ring
soon it will be christmas day


city sidewalks, busy sidewalks
dressed in holiday style
in the air there’s a feeling of christmas
children laughing, people passing
meeting smile after smile
and on every street corner you’ll hear


silver bells, silver bells
its christmas time in the city
ring-a-ling, hear them ring
soon it will be christmas day


strings of streetlights, even stoplights
blink a bright red and green
as the shoppers rush home with their treasures
hear the snow crunch, see the kids bunch
this is santa’s big scene
and above all this bustle you’ll hear


silver bells, silver bells
its christmas time in the city
ring-a-ling, hear them ring
soon it will be christmas day
