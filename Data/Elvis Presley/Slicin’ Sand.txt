take off your shoes, put down your hair
turn on the music, and we'll get somewhere
dance, dance, dance, till your toes get tan
we're gonna to have us a ball on the beach
a-slicing sand


hug me a heap, swing me a lot
we got a lot of ocean if it gets too hot
o-o-o, o-o-o, baby, take my hand
we'll have some real rocking fun in the sun
a-slicing sand


slice through to the left, slice to the right
slice down the middle, baby, hold me tight
o-o-o wee, o-o-o, baby, hold my hand
we'll have some real rocking fun in the sun
slicing sand
we'll have some real rocking fun in the sun
slicing sand
ooo yeah
