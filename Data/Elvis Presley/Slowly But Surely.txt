slowly but surely, i'm gonna wear you down
slowly but surely, i'm gonna bring you 'round
to my way of thinking, my way of kissing, my way of loving
slowly but surely, i'm gonna make you mine


i ain't gonna rush ya, i'll let you meditate
though i wanna crush ya, my arms'll have to wait
i'll just take it easy, slow nice and easy, real cool really
slowly but surely, i'm gonna make you mine


oh yeah! mm-mm
i got a feeling i'm not wasting my time
oh yeah
when you get the message it's gonna be fine


slowly but surely, the table's gonna turn
slowly but surely, your lips are gonna burn
for what you've been missing, my kind of kissing, my kind of loving
slowly but surely, i'm gonna make you mine


oh yeah! mm-mm
i got a feeling i'm not wasting my time
oh yeah
when you get the message it's gonna be fine


slowly but surely, the table's gonna turn
slowly but surely, your lips are gonna burn
for what you've been missing, my kind of kissing, my kind of loving
slowly but surely, i'm gonna make you mine


i'm gonna make you mine
i'm gonna make you mine
