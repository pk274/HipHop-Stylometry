i'm just a smokey mountain boy
coming back to the hills i love
where the tops of pine all bend in the wind
and the deep blue sky above


the closer and closer i get to home
the more excited i am
those were the mornings i'd roll out of bed
start the day off with a hot cornbread
smothered in huckleberry jam


i'm just a smokey mountain boy
comin' back to the hills i love
where the tops of pine all bend in the wind
and the deep blue sky above


i can almost hear the hounds running through the woods
close on the trail of the hare
how i long to be with them
following the hounds a-hunting again
getting me a big old grizzly bear


i'm just a smokey mountain boy
comin' back to the hills i love
where the tops of pine are bending in the wind
and the deep blue sky above


i traveled around and met lots of girls
no matter how many i see
i left some pretty ones behind
i know back home is where i'll find
the girl whose love means for me


i'm just a smokey mountain boy
comin' back to the hills i love
where the tops of pine are bending in the wind
and the deep blue sky above
