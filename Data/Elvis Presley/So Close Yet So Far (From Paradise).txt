so close, yet so far from paradise
i hold you in my arms in paradise
is mine, then you slip away
like a child at play, and here am i
so close, yet so far from paradise


when you are close to me, it's paradise
we kiss, oh my love, paradise
is mine, then suddenly you're gone from me
like a floating star, i see, and here am i
so close, yet so far from paradise


i reach out for you, but each time i do
i always find you gone
i know love is new, i'll take care of you
in my arms is where you belong


just a step away are we from paradise
take my hand, and come away to paradise
my love, i want you close to me
i need you desperately, oh here am i
waiting for you
here am i
praying for you
here am i, so close, yet so far from paradise
