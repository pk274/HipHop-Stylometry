my baby's long and tall
shaped like a cannonball
say, every time she loves me
lordy, you can hear me squall

she cried, "ooh-wee
i believe i'll change my mind"
she said, "i'm so glad i'm living"
i cried, "i'm so glad you're mine"


my baby knows just how
to treat me right
gives me plenty loving
morning, noon and night

she cried, "ooh-wee
i believe i'll change my mind"
she said, "i'm so glad i'm living"
i cried, "i'm so glad you're mine"


when my baby does
what she does to me
i climb the highest mountain
dive in the deepest sea

she cried, "ooh-wee
i believe i'll change my mind"
she said, "i'm so glad i'm living"
i cried, "i'm so glad you're mine"


my baby's lips are red
and sweet like wine
and when she kisses me
i get high every time

she cried, "ooh-wee
i believe i'll change my mind"
she said, "i'm so glad i'm living"
i cried, "i'm so glad you're mine"
