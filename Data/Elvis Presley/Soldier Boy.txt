soldier boy, why feel blue?
don't you believe that she will be true?


soldier boy, tell me, why do you cry?
when you return, she'll rush to your side


so prove your love is true
she'll be there to say "i do"
and if you go sea or land
she'll make you understand


oh, while you're gone, oh, try to believe
her love for you is really for real


so prove your love is true
she'll be there to say "i do"
and if you go sea or land
she'll make you understand


oh, while you're gone, oh, try to believe
her love for you is really for real


soldier boy
