there was a man, a lonely man
who lost his love through his indifference
a heart that cared that went unshared
until it died within his silence


and solitaire is the only game in town
and every road that takes him, takes him down
while life goes on around him everywhere
he's playing solitaire


and keeping to himself begins to deal
and still the king of hearts is well concealed
another losing game comes to an end
and deals them out again


a little hope goes up in smoke
just how it goes, goes without saying
there was a man, a lonely man
who would command the hand he's playing


and solitaire is the only game in town
and every road that takes him, takes him down
while life goes on around him everywhere
he's playing solitaire


and keeping to himself begins to deal
and still the king of hearts is well concealed
another losing game comes to an end
and deals them out again


and solitaire is the only game in town
and every road that takes him, takes him down
life goes on around him everywhere
he's playing solitaire
