who made the mountains? who made the trees?
who made the rivers flow to the sea?
and who sends the rain when the earth is dry?
somebody bigger than you and i


who made the flowers to bloom in the spring?
who made the song for the robins to sing?
and who hung the moon and the stars in the sky?
somebody bigger than you and i


he lights the way when the road is long
he keeps you company
and with his love to guide you
he walks beside you
just like he walks with me


when we're filled with despair
who gives me courage to go from there?
and who gives me faith that will never die?
somebody bigger than you and i (bigger than you and i)
