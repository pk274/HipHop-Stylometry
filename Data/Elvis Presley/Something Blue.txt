something old, the time's gone by
something new, these tears i cry
something borrowed were those lips my lips knew
and that's why i'm something blue

something old, the vows we made
something new, the price i paid
something borrowed, love was tried but not true
now my life is something blue


i guess that i'd better smile
walking behind you down the aisle
i feel i'm walking to my doom
i'm really not the best man in this room


something old, the dreams we planned
something new, his wedding band
something borrowed was the heart i gave you
you returned it torn in two

something old, the dreams we planned
something new, his wedding band
something borrowed was the heart i gave you
you returned it torn in two


and that's why
and that's why i'm something blue
