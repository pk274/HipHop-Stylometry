something in the way she moves
attracts me like no other lover
something in the way she moves me
i don't want to leave her now
you know i believe, and how


somewhere in her smile she knows
all i gotta do is think about her
something in her style it shows me
i don't want to leave her now
you know i believe, and how


you're asking me will our love grow
i don't know, i don't know
you stick around and it may show
i don't know, i don't know
