i saw three shrimp in the water
two were old and gray
i swam a little bit closer and
i heard the third one say


"goodbye mama shrimp, papa, shake my hand
here come the shrimp boat for to take me louisian'
here come the shrimp boat for to take me louisian'"


he showed his mama and papa
the shrimp newspaper he read
an invitation to all the shrimp
and this is what it said


free ride, new orleans, stay in grand hotel
big creole gal who help you come out of your shell
big creole gal who help you come out of your shell


if i should live to be ninety
i will never forget
the little shrimp and the song he sang
as he jumped into the net


"goodbye mama shrimp, papa, shake my hand
here come the shrimp boat for to take me louisian'
here come the shrimp boat for to take me louisian'
here come the shrimp boat for to take me louisian'
here come the shrimp boat for to take me louisian'"
