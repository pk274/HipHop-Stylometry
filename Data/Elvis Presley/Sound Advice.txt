some folks tell you what to do
they think they know more than you
they insist that they're giving sound advice
but as sure as you're living
it ain't sound, it ain't nice
it just doesn't sound like sound advice

some folks like to be the boss
they get up on their high horse
oh they say that you're getting, sound advice
there's one thing i'm betting
it ain't wise, it ain't nice
you won't like the sound of their advice


sound advice we're given
sound advice
just as sure as you're as you're living
if your smart you'll think twice
when they start to sound off with advice


sound advice we're given
sound advice
just as sure as you're as you're living
if your smart you'll think twice
when they start to sound off with advice
don't listen to their sound advice
