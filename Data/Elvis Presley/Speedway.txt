take a ton of bolts and steel
a whole lot to sweat, a set of wheels
on the speedway
the flag is down, pistons pound
plenty of engines ripping around
on the speedway (go, go, go, go)


go for the money and lead the pack
push the throttle and burn the track
curl and swirl like you're doing a dance
straightaway is coming and now's your chance
on the speedway (speedway)
on the speedway (speedway)
on the speedway (speedway)
stomp that pedal down to the floor
as much as you give, the crowd wants more, more, more, more, more, more
on the speedway (speedway)
on the speedway


take a spin, hit the brakes
and your little girl shivers and shakes
on the speedway
clear the way, coming through
kiss from your baby is just pushing you
on the speedway (go, go, go, go)


go for the money and lead the pack
push the throttle and burn the track
curl and swirl like you're doing a dance
straightaway is coming and now's your chance
on the speedway (speedway)
on the speedway (speedway)
on the speedway (speedway)
stomp that pedal down to the floor
as much as you give, the crowd wants more, more, more, more, more, more
on the speedway (speedway)


on the speedway (speedway)
on the speedway (speedway)
on the speedway (speedway)
on the speedway (speedway)
on the speedway (speedway)
on the speedway (speedway)
