when her motor's warm, and she's purring sweet
buddy let me warn you, you're on a one-way street
she'll crowd you close, spin your wheels
then you're gonna know how it feels
to spinout, yeah, spinout


better watch those curves, never let her steer
if she can shake your nerves, boy
then she can strip your gears
she'll get you high and going fast
then she'll let you run out of gas
so spinout, yeah, spinout


the road to love is full of danger signs
too many guys were lost who crossed those double lines


don't you know she's out to prove she can really score
never saw parts move, boy
like that before
to flag you down, that's her goal
scoot before you lose control
and spinout, yeah, spinout




don't you know she's out to prove she can really score
never saw parts move, boy
like that before
to flag you down, that's her goal
scoot before you lose control
and spinout, spinout, spinout, all right
