a little bird, he told me so
he said come on, get on the go
open your eyes the sky is full of butterflies
the blossoms on the trees stir up the honey bees
spring makes my fever right


spring fever, spring is here at last
spring fever, my heart's beating fast
get up, get out spring is everywhere


well if you feel the wanderlust
just grab a car or hop a bus
in every town there's excitement to be found
so much is happening
don't miss the joy of spring
the world's in love just look around


spring fever comes to everyone
spring fever, it's time for fun
get up, get out spring is everywhere


spring fever, it's spring fever time
spring fever, watch that fever climb
get up, get out spring is everywhere


spring is everywhere
