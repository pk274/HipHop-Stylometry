when the storms of life are raging
stand by me (stand by me)
when the storms of life are raging
stand by me (stand by me)

when the world is tossing me
like a ship out on the sea
thou who rulest wind and water
stand by me (stand by me)


when i'm growing old and feeble
stand by me (stand by me)
when i'm growing old and feeble
stand by me (stand by me)

when i do the best i can
and my friends misunderstand
thou who never lost a battle
stand by me (stand by me)
thou who never lost a battle
stand by me (stand by me)
