look who's back, stay away joe
chock taw, chick a shaw, going to drink me hearty
welcome back, stay away joe


stay away joe they call me
stay away joe, oh yeah
but if you need me call me
hoop and a holler and i'll be there

who keeps turning up like a bad penny
take one guess, stay away joe
always finding trouble a-plenty
oh my yes, i reckon you know




when two lips are right for the picking
who crops up, stay away joe
i love them and leave them screaming 'n kicking
giddy up look at him look at him go


stay away joe they call me
stay away joe, oh yeah
but if you need me call me
hoop and a holler and i'll be there
