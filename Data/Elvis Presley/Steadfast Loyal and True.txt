farewell, royal high school
we'll remember you
dear alma mater
we're steadfast, loyal, and true


as we go onward
in the lives we lead
your light will guide us
your motto is our creed


we will look back fondly
at your ivy walls
recalling precious moments
within your hallowed halls


farewell, royal high school
we'll remember you
dear alma mater
we're steadfast, loyal, and true
