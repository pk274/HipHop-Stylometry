i'm a steamroller baby
i'm about to roll all over you
i'm a steamroller baby
i'm about to roll all over you
i'm going to inject your soul
with sweet rock and roll, poor heaven


i'm a cement mixer
a churning urn of burning funk
i'm a cement mixer
a churning urn of burning funk
iâ€™m a demolition derby
a hefty hunk, steaming junk


i'm a steamroller baby
i'm about to roll all over you
i'm a steamroller baby
i'm about to roll all over you
i'm going to inject your soul
with some sweet rock and roll
and shoot you full of rhythm and blues


i'm a napalm bomb
guaranteed to blow your mind
i'm a napalm bomb
guaranteed to blow your mind
if i can't have your love now baby
there won't be nothing left behind
