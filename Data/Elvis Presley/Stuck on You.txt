you can shake an apple off an apple tree
shake-a, shake-a sugar, but you'll never shake me
uh-uh-uh

i'm going to stick like glue
stick, because i'm
stuck on you


i'm going to run my fingers thru your long black hair
squeeze you tighter than a grizzly bear

stick, because i'm
stuck on you


hide in the kitchen, hide in the hall
ain't gonna do you no good at all
'cause once i catch you and the kissing starts
a team of wild horses couldn't tear us apart


try to take a tiger from his daddy's side
that's how love is going to keep us tied
uh-uh-uh
oh yeah, uh, uh
i'm gonna stick like glue
stick, because i'm
stuck on you
