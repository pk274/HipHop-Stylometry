take one


summer kisses, winter tears
summer kisses, winter tears
summer kisses, winter tears
that was what she gave to me
never thought i'd travel all alone
the trail of memories


happy hours, lonely years
happy hours, lonely years
but i guess i can't complain
for i still recall the summer sun
through all the winter rain (feeling in my body, feels so right)


the fire of love
(won't you lift your eyes up childrеn)
(look to the sky)
the fire of lovе
(heaven stands before you, the gates are open wide)
ooh, hoo, hoo
(shelter for the weary, comfort for the weak)
(we'll leave the devil's evil, sweatin' on the street)


summer kisses, winter tears
like the stars, they fade away
leaving me to spend my lonely nights
with dreams of yesterday


i've got a (feeling in my body, feels so right)
i've got a (feeling in my body, feels so right)
i've got a (feeling in my body, feels so right)
i've got a (feeling in my body, feels so right)
i've got a (feeling in my body, feels so right)
i've got a, i've got a, i've got a
summer kisses, winter tears
