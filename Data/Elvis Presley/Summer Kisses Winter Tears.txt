summer kisses, winter tears
that was what she gave to me
never thought i'd travel all alone
the trail of memories

happy hours, lonely years
but i guess i can't complain
for i still recall the summer sun
through all the winter rain


the fire of love, the fire of love
can burn from afar
and nothing can light the dark of the night
like a falling star


summer kisses, winter tears
like the stars, they fade away
leaving me to spend my lonely nights
with dreams of yesterday


the fire of love, the fire of love
can burn from afar
and nothing can light the dark of the night
like a falling star


summer kisses, winter tears
like the stars, they fade away
leaving me to spend my lonely nights
with dreams of yesterday


leaving me to spend my lonely nights
with dreams of yesterday
summer kisses, winter tears
