when we kiss, my heart's on fire
burning with a strange desire
and i know, each time i kiss you
that your heart's on fire too


so, my darling, please surrender (surrender)
all your love so warm and tender (surrender)
let me hold you in my arms, dear
while the moon shines bright above


all the stars will tell the story
of our love and all its glory
let us take this night of magic
and make it a night of love


won't you please surrender to me (surrender)
your lips, your arms, your heart, dear (surrender)
be mine forever
be mine tonight
