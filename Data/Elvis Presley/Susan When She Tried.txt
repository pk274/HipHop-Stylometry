i got over charlotte thompson, goldie johnson
lord they done me wrong
i took it hard with peggy harper
she hurt me bad, but not for long
there's just one i remember
makes me feel funny down inside
i'd trade 'em all for just one hour
of susan when she tried


no there's never been a woman
who could make me weak inside
and give me what i needed
like susan when she tried


it gets worse in the summer
when the nights are hot and long
and it's bad in december
when they play those christmas songs
so if you ask me and i don't tell you
bet your sweet bottom dollar i lied
cause there's never been one better
than susan when she tried
