sweet angeline, i loved you much more than poets say in rhyme
just for one short time


sweet angeline remember though we've not seen the summer through
i lived only for you
i'm only human and i realize it's no use trying to disguise
my love for you angeline has ended
so let's be thankful now not sad
for the little love, we've had
