where it began, i can't begin to knowin'
but then i know it's growing strong
oh, was in the spring, (whooo)
and spring became the summer
who'd've believe you'd come along


hands, touching hands, reaching out
touching me, touching you
oh, sweet caroline
good times never seemed so good
i've been inclined to believe it never would


and now i, i look at the night (whooo)
and it don't seem so lonely
we fill it up with only two, oh
and when i hurt
hurting runs off my shoulder
how can i hurt when holding you


one, touching one, reaching out
touching me, touching you
oh, sweet caroline
good times never seemed so good
i've been inclined to believe they never would


ohhh, sweet caroline, good times never seemed so good
