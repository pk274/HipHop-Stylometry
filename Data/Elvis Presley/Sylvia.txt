these long lonely evenings
here i am on the phone
wondering if she will call
she said she would write me
because she knows i'm alone
but i hear nothing at all


i'm waiting for a word of love from sylvia
you think she'd never heard of love my sylvia
but when i'm with her lord, i forgive her
because she's more than the whole world to me
there's nothing like a word of love from sylvia
the only one i'm thinking of is sylvia
feeling so sad now, i'll be so glad now
if i just had my sylvia with me


that old weeping willow
seems to whisper her name
why did she go away
the tears on my pillow
they're not hard to explain
there's nothing else i can say
