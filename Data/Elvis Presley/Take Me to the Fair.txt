take me to the fair
take me to the fair, don't know anywhere
i would rather be
let's go to the fair
we'll walk hand in hand through tomorrow land
honey, you and me


i wanna see everything, do everything
while we're doin' it all
i'll buy the peanuts and popcorn
we'll have us a ball


you can spend my pay
crush me in the crowds, i'll be in the clouds
honey, i don't care
take me there by sleigh
roller skate or bike, anyway you like
but take me to the fair
