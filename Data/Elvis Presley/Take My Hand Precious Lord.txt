precious lord, take my hand
lead me on, let me stand
i'm tired, i'm weak, i'm lone
through the storm, through the night
lead me on to the light
take my hand, precious lord, lead me home


when my way grows drear (precious lord)
precious lord, linger near (precious lord)
when my light is almost gone
hear my cry, hear my call
hold my hand lest i fall
take my hand, precious lord, lead me home


when the darkness appears
and the night draws near
and the day is past and gone
at the river i stand
guide my feet, hold my hand
take my hand, precious lord, lead me home


precious lord, take my hand (precious lord)
lead me on, let me stand (precious lord)
i'm tired, i'm weak, i'm lone
through the storm, through the night
lead me on to the light
take my hand, precious lord, lead me home
(lead me home)
