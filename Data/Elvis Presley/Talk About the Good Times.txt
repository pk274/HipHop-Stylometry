well i remember when i was as children
the time the people used to treat the neighbor like a fellow man
and all their singing and big prayer meetings
when a man was proud to walk up and shake his neighbor's hand


oh you talk about the good times
talk about the good times
oh if you ever needed help a friend was there
some good neighbor
help lift your burden
mmm, and the simple joys of life a friend would share


times are harder and the people are changing
now most folks couldn't tell you who their neighbors are
all their guns are loaded, the front doors are bolted
ain't this old world taking hate and fear just a little too far


oh you talk about the good times
talk about the good times
i wish i could go back to the days i'm speaking of
when a friend would meet you
and a smile would greet you
what this old world needs now is a little old fashioned love


my granddaddy god rest his soul now
well we had a big long talk together the day he died
said son this world is full of hate and venom
and i can't wait to leave this old place and rest on the other side


oh you talk about the good times, talk about the good times
talk about the good times
i'm gonna see all the friends i knew in the good old days
we'll have a big hand shaking
and sit and talk together
sit down by the river jordan and sing our blues away
