i can't conceal the tender feeling
now that you are close to me
i look at you with tender feeling
and can't help kiss you tenderly


i offer you a true devotion
all life through, my love i vow
for this is real, this sweet emotion
this tender feeling i have now


somehow i knew from the moment our lips first met
you'd be the girl i could never forget


no other love could be appealing
i loved you right from the start
and with each kiss i'll keep revealing
the tender feeling in my heart
