thanks to the rolling, rolling, rolling
thanks to the rolling sea
thanks to the rolling, rolling, rolling
thanks to the rolling sea


fish on the table and fish on the fire
fried fish hanging on the tree
everything here that your heart desires
thanks to the rolling sea
thanks to the rolling sea


living is good, and living is fine
we're happy as can be
we owe all this to the salty brine
thanks to the rolling sea
thanks to the rolling sea


we work all day, but our hearts are gay
and while we work we sing
the mighty sea is good to us
and we've got everything


abalone steaks and tuna fish cakes
taste so heavenly
we know who we owe it to
thanks to the rolling sea


thanks to the rolling, rolling, rolling
thanks to the rolling sea
thanks to the rolling, rolling, rolling
thanks to the rolling sea
thanks to the rolling, rolling, rolling
thanks to the rolling sea
