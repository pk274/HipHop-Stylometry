pedro the bull was a killer
king of the bullfighter ringer
he'd wipe up the floor with each brave matador
then have matador stew for his dinner

he heard the crowd shouting "olé" (olé)
but he met his master that day


the bullfighter was a lady
and it was true love at first sight
her red cape was waving but pedro was shaking
he wanted to date her that night


pedro the bull he was smitten
first time the love bug had bitten
he once was a mad bull, a wild and a bad bull
but now he was mild as a kitten

the people were starting to hiss
but pedro just wanted to kiss


the bullfighter was a lady
and pedro he liked what he saw
he floated on air with a rose in his hair
as he waltzed with that sweet matador

his fate was a bad one, his tale is a sad one
it's hanging right over her door


olé!
