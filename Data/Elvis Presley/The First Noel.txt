the first noel the angels did say
was to certain poor shepherds
in fields as they lay
in fields fields where they lay keeping their sheep
on a cold winter's night that was so deep


they looked up and saw a star
shining in the east beyond them far
and to the earth it gave great light
and so it continued both day and night

noel, noel, noel, noel
born is the king of israel
