gather round me, buddy, raise your glasses high
and drink to a fool, a crazy fool
who told his baby goodbye
too late he found he loves her so much he wants to die


so drink to a fool, a crazy fool
who told his baby goodbye
he needs her, he needs her so
he wonders why he let her go


she's found, she's found, she's found
a new love, buddy, he's a lucky guy
so drink to a fool, a crazy fool
who told his baby goodbye

he needs her, he needs her so
he wonders why he let her go

she's found, she's found, she's found
a new love, buddy, he's a lucky guy
so drink to a fool, a crazy fool
who told his baby goodbye
who told his baby goodbye
goodbye, goodbye, goodbye
