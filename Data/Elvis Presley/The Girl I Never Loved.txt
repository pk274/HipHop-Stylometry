the girl i never loved
will never know i cared
and all my dreams of her
are dreams i'll never share
for i want her and i need her
and i know it might have been
but it ended long before it could begin


the kiss i never got
somebody else will take
the plans i never made
somebody else will make
oh i'm lonely, i'm so lonely
because it's her i'm thinking of
but she'll always be the girl i never loved
never loved, never loved
