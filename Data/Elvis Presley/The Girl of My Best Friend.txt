the way she walks, the way she talks
how long can i pretend?


oh, i can't help it, i'm in love
with the girl of my best friend


her lovely hair, her skin so fair
i could go on and never end


oh, i can't help it, i'm in love
with the girl of my best friend


i want to tell her how i love her so
and hold her in my arms, but then
what if she got real mad and told him so?
i could never face either one again


the way they kiss, their happiness
will my aching heart ever mend?


or will i always be in love
with the girl of my best friend?


never end
will it ever end?
please let it end
will it ever end?
