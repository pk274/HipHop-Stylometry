to dream the impossible dream
to fight the unbeatable foe
to bear with unbearable sorrow
to run where the brave dare not go


to right the un-rightable wrong
to be better far than you are
to try when your arms are too weary
to reach the unreachable star


oh, this is my quest, to follow that star
no matter how hopeless
no matter how far
to fight for the right
without question or pause
to be willing to march into hell
for a heavenly cause


and i know if i'll only be true
to this glorious quest
that my heart will lie peaceful and calm
when i'm laid to my rest


and the world will be better for this
that one man, scorned and covered with scars
still strove with his last ounce of courage
to reach the unreachable star

and the world will be better for this
oh, that one man, scorned and covered with scars
he still strove with his last ounce of courage
to reach the unreachable star

thank you very much
