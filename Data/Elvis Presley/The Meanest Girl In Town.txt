she'll tell you that she loves you, make you feel just like a king
she'll cry to you and lie to you, she'll do most anything
she'll get right up next to you, and the first thing that you know
you'll be telling her you're sorry because she hurt you so
i said she's evil, the most evil girl i've found, oh yeah
there ain't no doubt about it, she's the meanest girl in town


she'll invite you over to her house at half past nine
you'll wear a suit, you'll wear a tie, you'll give your shoes a shine
you'll take a real deep breath and knock on her front door
her little sister will tell you, "she don't live here anymore"
i said she's evil, hah, the most evil girl i've found, oh yeah
there ain't no doubt about it, she's the meanest girl in town
ah yeah, hah, hah, hah


she'll put her arms around you and squeeze with all her might
she'll breathe a sigh and pucker her lips and close her eyes real tight
your heart will pound like thunder, you'll melt in her embrace
but when you go to kiss her, why, she'll laugh right in your face
because she's evil, the most evil girl i've found
hah hah hah, hah hah hah hah
there is no doubt about it, she's the meanest girl in town
hah hah hah, hah hah hah hah....
