yesterday has slipped away
and the sun is welcoming the evening shadows
of a perfect day and the next step is love
the next step is love


we've walked barefoot through the misty meadows
laughing at each other in the rain
made some faces at some people in the park
and didn't bother to explain
fun, fun, look at us run
going nowhere special really fast
but we've yet to taste the icing on the cake
that we've been baking with the past


and the next step is love
so what are we waiting for?
the next step is love
girl, it's for sure

yesterday has slipped away
and the sun is welcoming the evening shadows
on a perfect day and the next step is love
the next step is love


love will be a place to run to
from the world they've willed you and me
we'll be closer than we've ever been
though looking back it's so hard to believe
hang it all out, we bring it on in
the best we've picked up on the way to now
changes are coming but together
we can make it through somehow


cause the next step is love
so what are we waiting for?
the next step is love
girl, it's for sure

yesterday, has slipped away
and the sun is welcoming the evening shadows
of a perfect day and the next step is love
the next step is love


yes it's love
the next step is love
yes it's love
next step is love
yes girl it's love
