the wonderful world of christmas
is a wonderful world to behold
the wonderful world of christmas
was made for the young and the old


smile and good cheer of each neighbor
and children with cheeks all aglow
so, warm is this christmassy feeling
with the tree tops all locked up with snow


listen to those wondrous bells
and you'll hear them say
open up your hearts to all on this holiday


the wonderful world of christmas
is a joy from the moment it starts
the wonderful world of christmas
shall remain every day in our hearts
(open up your hearts to all, to the wonderful world of christmas)
