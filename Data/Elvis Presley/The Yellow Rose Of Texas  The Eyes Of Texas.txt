oh, the yellow rose of texas is the only girl i love
her eyes are even bluer than texas skies above
her heart's as big as texas and wherever i may go
i'll remember her forever because i love her so


there are so many roses that bloom along the way
but my heart's in amarillo and that's where it will stay
with the yellow rose of texas so i'd better get there fast
'cause i know i was her first love and i wanna be her last


oh, the yellow rose of texas is the only girl i love
her eyes are even bluer than texas skies above
her heart's as big as texas and wherever i may go
i'll remember her forever because i love her so


the eyes of texas are upon you
all the live long day
the eyes of texas are upon you
you cannot get away

do not think you can escape them
at night or early in the morn
the eyes of texas are upon you
till gabriel blows his horn

the eyes of texas are upon you
all the live long day
the eyes of texas are upon you
you cannot get away

do not think you can escape them
at night or early in the morn
the eyes of texas are upon you
till gabriel blows his horn

the eyes of texas are upon you
all the live long day
the eyes of texas are upon you
you cannot get away

do not think you can escape them
at night or early in the morn
the eyes of texas are upon you
till gabriel blows his horn
