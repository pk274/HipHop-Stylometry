there is no god, but god
i know this is true
god made everything
he made me, he made you
there'd be no birds
no planes to sail in the blue
without his wondrous eyes
to see them through


they say god made land
and he gave it all to man
yes i know he's mighty good and true
there is no god, but god
and he knows everything to do
so just you call on him
and he will share his love with you


there is no god, but god
i know this is true
for god made everything
he made me, he made you

there'd be no birds
no planes to sail in the blue
without his wondrous eyes
to see them through
