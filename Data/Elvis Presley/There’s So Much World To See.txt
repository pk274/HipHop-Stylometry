baby it's wrong, wrong as can be
to try and tie a guy like me
i could never settle down in a little sleepy town
there is so much world to see


sure would be happy for a while
but then we'd have to part
when tears replace your loving smile
well, i don't want to be the guy
who has to break your heart


so, here's where it ends, not lovers but friends
though your lips are tempting me
maybe i'm a fool and yet
this wanderer just can't forget
there is so much world to see




so, here's where it ends, not lovers but friends
though your lips are tempting me
maybe i'm a fool and yet
this wanderer just can't forget
there is so much world to see
for me, there's so much world to see
yeah, yeah
