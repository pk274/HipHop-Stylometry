there's a brand new day on the horizon
everything's gonna be just fine
there's a brand new day on the horizon
and the whole world's gonna be mine


i'm gonna tell old trouble, he'd better be moving on
happiness is going to take his place around here from now on
the old dark clouds are gonna roll away, the sun is gonna shine
and the whole world's gonna be mine


i'm gonna tell old heartaches, pack his bags and go
i've decided that i don't want him hanging around no more
don't you know, i said everything's gonna be just fine?
'cause the whole world's gonna be mine


i'm gonna chase away those blues till they're out of sight
and i guarantee you, honey, they won't be coming back
well, don't you know, i said everything's gonna be all right?
'cause the whole world's gonna be mine


i know my luck's gonna change, just you wait and see
starting tomorrow, only good things in life are gonna come to me
there's a brand new day on the horizon
and the whole world's gonna be mine
and the whole world's gonna be mine
