take away the scent of flowers
cover up the sky of blue
close my ears to tender love songs
they remind me too much of you


hide young lovers' warm embraces
keep stars and moonlight from my view
let me forget there are such places
they remind me too much of you


must i evermore be haunted
day after day, my whole life through
by the memory of each moment
that i spent alone with you?


if these lovely things don't hurt you
our love just wasn't meant to be
but please come back to me, my darling
if they remind you too much of me
