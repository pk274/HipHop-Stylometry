i woke up this morning and i tried to call you, mmm
but you weren't there, kinda put me in despair
so i thought that maybe i could lose my mind
in the countryside so i went for a ride


but i never stopped thinking about you
found myself wishing you were there
just to be with me, feel the breeze
sun didn't smile i didn't care


i decided to try just one more time
to let you know i really love you so
before i arrived i saw you go away
with another guy, a tear filled my eye


but i never stopped thinking about you
found myself wishing you were there
just to be with me, feel the breeze
sun didn't smile i didn't care


a long time has passed since that day i cried
life is fine and i'm doing fine
when i'm at home and i feel all alone
well i think of you, try to get a message through


but i never stopped thinking about you
found myself wishing you were there
just to be with me, feel the breeze
sun didn't smile i didn't care
