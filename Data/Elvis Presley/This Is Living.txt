this is living
full of fun and free
this is living
that's the life for me


it's good to laugh and sing
don't worry about a thing
wear a happy smile
cut loose and run a mile

if you relax and just enjoy it all
life has got to be a ball


this is living
full of fun and free
this is living
that's the life for me


it wouldn't mean a thing (no, no, no)
if i could be a king (no, no, no)
i really wouldn't care (no, wouldn't care)
to be a millionaire (millionaire)

i'd rather find someone to love a lot
live and give it all i've got


this is living
full of fun and free
this is living
that's the life for me


don't want to settle down (don't want to settle down)
i gotta move around (i gotta move around)
i gotta lot of time (i gotta lot of time)
i'm gonna wait and find (i'm gonna wait and find)

the kind of girl who's heart is restless too
the kind who feels the way i do


this is living
full of fun and free
this is living
that's the life for me
