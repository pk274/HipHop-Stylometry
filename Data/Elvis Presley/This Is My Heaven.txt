this is my heaven
being here with you
make it last forever
this is my heaven
it's a dream come true
make it last forever
come to me now
and take my hand
this is the paradise i plan
you're like an angel
sent from up above
let's stay close together
you brought me heaven
when i shared your love
make it last forever
here beneath the sky beside the sea
this is my heaven
when you come to me
