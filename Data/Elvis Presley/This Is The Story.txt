i play the song, that was our own
your photograph's by my side
i know i can't forget you
so i don't even try

the note you left is in my hand
i read again what you say
you're sorry but you love him
and you've both gone away


this is the story of a man
whose world has fallen apart
and it's the story
that is breaking my heart


an open fire, my favorite chair
i get a book from the shelf
but the words i am reading
could apply to myself


this is the story of a man
whose world has fallen apart
and it's the story
that is breaking my heart


yes, it's the story that is breaking my heart
yes, it's the story that is breaking my heart
yes, it's the story that is breaking my heart
