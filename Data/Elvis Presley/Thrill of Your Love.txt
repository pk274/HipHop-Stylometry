i have wished for the wealth of a great millionaire
i have reached for a bright star above
but the thrill of it all, to me, seems so small
when compared to the thrill of your love


i'd rather give everything that i own in this world
than to be all alone and unloved
for no earthly price and no sacrifice
is too much to give for your love
