i give, give you my heart
today, tomorrow and forever
you'll always be my love

i vow we'll never part
today, tomorrow and forever
long as there's stars above


the cares of life will fade away
as long as we're together


so stay, stay in my arms
today, tomorrow and forever
you'll always be my love


i give, give you my heart
today, tomorrow and forever
you'll always be my love


the cares of life will fade away
as long as we're together


so stay, stay in my arms
today, tomorrow and forever
you'll always be my love
(today, tomorrow and forever)
you'll always be my love
