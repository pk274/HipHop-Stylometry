tomorrow night
will you remember what you said tonight?
tomorrow night
will all thrills be gone?


tomorrow night
will it be just another memory
or just another lovely song
that's in my poor heart to linger on?


your lips are so tender
your heart is beating fast
and you're willing to surrender
tell me, darling, will it last?


tomorrow night
will you be with me when the moon's bright?
tomorrow night
will you say those lovely things you said tonight?


tomorrow night
will it be just another memory
or just another lovely song
that's in my fool heart to linger on?


your lips are so tender
your heart is beating fast
and you're willing to surrender
tell me, darling, will it last?


tomorrow night
will you remember what you said tonight?
tomorrow night
will you say those lovely things you said tonight?
