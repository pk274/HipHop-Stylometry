hold me tight
the moon is so bright
tonight is so right for love
now's the time
to say you're the one
tonight is so right for love

one by one the stars appear
they twinkle in your eyes
who'd believe that we'd be here
so near to paradise

this could be the kiss
to unlock heaven's door
that magic hour of bliss
that we both waited for
i love you more and more


oh, we could fly right up to the sky
the things we've been dreaming of
and how real they would seem
a midsummer night's dream
can't you see that tonight's so right for love

and how real they would seem
a midsummer night's dream
can't you see that tonight's so right for love


hold me tight
the moon's so bright
tonight is so right for love
