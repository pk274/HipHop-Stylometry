when i walk through that door
baby be polite
you're gonna make me sore
if you don't greet me right
don't you ever kiss me once, kiss me twice
treat me nice


i know that you've been told
it's not fair to tease
so if you come on cold
i'm really gonna freeze
if you don't want me to be cold as ice
treat me nice


make me feel at home
if you really care
scratch my back and run your pretty
fingers through my hair


you know i'll be your slave
if you ask me to
but if you don't behave
i'll walk right out on you
if you want my love then take my advice
treat me nice

if you want my love then take my advice
