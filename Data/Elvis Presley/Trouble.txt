if you're looking for trouble
you came to the right place
if you're looking for trouble
just look right in my face

i was born standing up
and talking back
my daddy was a green-eyed mountain jack


because i'm evil
my middle name is misery
well i'm evil
so don't you mess around with me


i've never looked for trouble
but i've never ran
i don't take no orders
from no kind of man

i'm only made out
of flesh, blood and bone
but if you're gonna start a rumble
don't you try it on alone


because i'm evil
my middle name is misery
well i'm evil
so don't you mess around with me

i'm evil, evil, evil as can be
i'm evil, evil, evil as can be
so don't mess around don't mess around don't mess around with me
i'm evil, i'm evil
evil, evil
so don't mess around, don't mess around with me
i'm evil, i tell you i'm evil
so don't mess around with me
yeah
