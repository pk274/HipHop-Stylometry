i've been travelling over mountains
even through the valleys too
i've been travelling night and day
i've been running all the way
baby, trying to get to you


ever since i read your letter
where you said you loved me true
i've been travelling night and day
i've been running all the way
baby, trying to get to you


when i read your loving letter
then my heart began to sing
there were many miles between us
but they didn't mean a thing


i just had to reach you, baby
in spite of all that i've been through
i kept travelling night and day
i kept running all the way
baby, trying to get to you




well if i had to do it over
that's exactly what i'd do
i would travel night and day
and i'd still run all the way
baby, trying to get to you


well, there's nothing that could hold me
or that could keep me away from you
when your loving letter told me
that you really loved me true


lord above me knows i love you
it was he who brought me through
when my way was dark as night
he would shine his brightest light
when i was trying to get to you
