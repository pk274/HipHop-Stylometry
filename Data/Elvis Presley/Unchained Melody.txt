oh, my love, my darling
i've hungered
for your touch
a long, lonely time
time goes by
so slowly
and time can do so much
are you, still mine?
i need your love, i need your love
god speed your love to me


lonely rivers flow to the sea, to the sea
to the open arms of the sea
lonely rivers cry, wait for me, wait for me
i'll be coming home, wait for me


my love, my darling
i've hungered for your touch
a long, lonely time
i need your love, i need your love
god speed your love, to me
