you're not a dream, you're not an angel, you're a woman
i'm not a king, just a man, take my hand
we'll make a space in this lives that we planned
and here we'll stay until it's time for you to go


yes, we're different worlds apart, we're not the same
we laughed and played at the start like in a game
you could have stayed outside my heart but in you came
and here you'll stay until it's time for you to go


don't ask why
don't ask how
don't ask forever
love me, love me, love me, love me now


this love of mine has no beginning, it has no end
i was an oak now i'm a willow and i can bend
and tho' i'll never in my life see you again
here i stay until it's time for you to go


oh yes, i'll stay until it's time for you to go
