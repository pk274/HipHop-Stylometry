viva el vino, viva el dinero
viva, viva
el amor


i like to drink wine and money is fine
i like the girls even more
viva el vino, viva el dinero
viva viva el amor

some pesos you pass, put wine in her glass
and soon she will say "sí señor"
viva el vino, viva el dinero
viva viva el amor


with wine on your lips and money in your pocket
and your sweetheart in your arms
you're rich as you can be
so lift up your glass, let's sing it all together
muchachas, caballeros
make this toast with me


we'll drink one more time, to money and wine
let's drink to the girls we adore
viva el vino, viva el dinero
viva viva el amor

sing one more time, money and wine
let's sing to the girls we adore
viva el vino, viva el dinero
viva viva el amor
