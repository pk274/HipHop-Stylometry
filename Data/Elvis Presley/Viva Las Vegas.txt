bright light city gonna set my soul
gonna set my soul on fire
got a whole lot of money that's ready to burn
so get those stakes up higher

there's a thousand pretty women waiting out there
and they're all living the devil may care
and i'm just a devil with love to spare
so viva las vegas
viva las vegas


how i wish that there were more
than the 24 hours in the day
even if there were 40 more
i wouldn't sleep a minute away

oh, there's blackjack and poker and the roulette wheel
a fortune won and lost on every deal
all you need's a strong heart and a nerve of steel
viva las vegas
viva las vegas


viva las vegas with you neon flashing
and your one arm bandits crashing
all those hopes down the drain
viva las vegas, turning day into nighttime
turning night into daytime
if you see it once
you'll never be the same again


i'm gonna keep on the run, i'm gonna have me some fun
if it costs me my very last dime
if i wind up broke, oh well, i'll always remember
that i had a swinging time

i'm gonna give it everything i've got
lady luck please let the dice stay hot
let me shoot a seven with every shot
viva las vegas
viva las vegas
viva las vegas
viva, viva las vegas
