if i could be you, if you could be me
for just one hour
if we could find a way to get inside
each other's mind

if you could see you through my eyes
instead of your ego
i believe you'd be, i believe you'd be surprised to see
that you've been blind


walk a mile in my shoes
walk a mile in my shoes
yeah, before you abuse, criticize and accuse
walk a mile in my shoes

now if we spend the day
throwing stones at one another
'cause i don't think,  'cause i don't think i wear my hair the same way you do

well, i may be common people
but i'm your brother
when you strike out
to try to hurt me
it's hurtin' you
lord have mercy




now there are people on reservations
and out in the ghetto
and brother there, but for the grace of god
go you and me

if i only had the wings
of a little angel
don't you know, i'd fly to the top of a mountain
and then i'd cry, cry, cry
