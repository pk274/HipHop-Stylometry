i just thought i heard a small voice crying
looked again and saw that it was me
i feel like a little boy denying
that he fears the night because he can't see

then a larger thought said, "stop your crying
don't be scared to search 'cause you may find
fate holds out a candle for your footsteps
time rolls back the shadows of your mind"


it's a long, long lonely night
you can make the morning if you try
it's a long, long lonely night
oh, we can make the morning if we try
girl, we can make the morning you and i
together, together, together


loneliness is a darkness' first companion
spend the night alone and faith may bend
share it all and see how fear starts fading
chase away the shadows with a friend

dawn's elusive light is just beginning
now the day can push away the night
dreams can make the sun feel much brighter
hope creates a foothold for the light
