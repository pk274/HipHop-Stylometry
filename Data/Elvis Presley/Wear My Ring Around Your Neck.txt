won't you wear my ring around your neck
to tell the world i'm yours, by heck
let them see your love for me
and let them see by the ring around your neck


won't you wear my ring around your neck
to tell the world i'm yours, by heck
let them know i love you so
and let them know by the ring around your neck


well, they say that going steady is not the proper thing
they say that we're too young to know the meaning of a ring
i only know i love, love you and that you love me too
so, darling, please do what i ask of you


won't you wear my ring around your neck
to tell the world i'm yours, by heck
let them see your love for me
and let them see by the ring around your neck


well, they say that going steady is not the proper thing
they say that we're too young to know the meaning of a ring
i only know i love, love you and that you love me too
so, darling, this is what i beg of you


won't you wear my ring around your neck
to tell the world i'm yours, by heck
let them know i love you so
and let them know by the ring around your neck


and let them know by the ring around your neck
and let them know by the ring around your neck
