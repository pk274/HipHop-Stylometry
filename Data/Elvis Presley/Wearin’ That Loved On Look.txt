i had to leave town for a little while
you said, you'd be good while i'm gone
but the look in your eye done told me you told a lie
i know there's been some carrying on


baby, you're wearing that loved on look
shoop, shoop, shoop, shoop
baby, you're wearing that loved on look


the ash trays are all full of ashes
the floor needs a touch of the mop
there's a man downstairs with-a long bushy hair
he said your party was a three day romp


baby, you're wearing that loved on look
shoop, shoop, shoop, shoop
baby, you're wearing that loved on look


baby, if you ever loved me
then bonnie and clyde loved the law
and a bird can't fly and i don't like apple pie
and trees won't grow in arkansas


baby, you're wearing that loved on look
shoop, shoop, shoop, shoop
baby, you're wearing that loved on look


i had to leave town for a little while
you said, you'd be good while i'm gone
but the look in your eye done told me you told a lie
well, i know there's been some carrying on
