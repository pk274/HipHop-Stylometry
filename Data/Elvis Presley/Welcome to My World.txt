welcome to my world
won't you come on in
miracles, i guess
still happen now and then


step into my heart
leave your cares behind
welcome to my world
built with you in mind


knock and the door shall be opened
seek and you will find
ask and you'll be given
the key to this heart of mine


i'll be waiting there
with my arms unfurled
waiting just for you
welcome to my world

welcome to my world
