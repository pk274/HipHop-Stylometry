western union
oh, western union clickety clack
i had a fight with my baby
ooh how sorry i am
she won't talk to me no how
i'm gonna send a telegram


western union oh yeah
send my loving baby back to me


she won't open my letters
she won't answer the phone
when i'm a-ringing her doorbell
she says there ain't nobody home

 
i love you is my message
just three words and no more
if she won't let you deliver
slip it underneath her door
