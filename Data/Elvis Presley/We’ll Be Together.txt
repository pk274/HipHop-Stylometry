oh, i will never forget the first night we met
was a love i was searching for
my heart beat faster and faster, oh so much faster
faster than it did before


juntos estaremos, siempre por siempre
junto a mi corazo'n, siempre estara's
we'll be together, and love forever
nothing can change our destiny


i knew the moment i kissed you, couldn't resist you
together we belong
and then i knew in that moment just what this glow meant
true love had come along


we'll be together, ever and ever
close to my heart, you'll always be
we'll be together and love forever
nothing can change our destiny
