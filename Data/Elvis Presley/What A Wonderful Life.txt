it's a wonderful life
this life i'm living
what a wonderful life
living a life of ease, oh

well, i got no job to worry me
no big bad boss to hurry me
it's a wonderful life
life's good to me


it's a wonderful road
this road i'm traveling
it's a wonderful road
heading beyond the hills, oh yeah

oh, it may go straight, or it may detour
but one thing that i know for sure
it's a wonderful life
life's good to me


i don't know where i'm going
don't care where i'm going
like the four winds are blowing i go on
laughing the day away
loving the night away
till the moon is gone

it's a wonderful life
this life i'm living
what a wonderful life
living the life i love, oh yeah

well, i've got neighbors, i've got friends
anywhere the rainbow ends
it's a wonderful life
life's good to me


i don't know where i'm going
don't care where i'm going
like the four winds are blowing i go on
laughing the day away, loving the night away
till the moon is gone

it's a wonderful life
this life i'm living
what a wonderful life
living the life i love, oh yeah

well, i've got neighbors, i've got friends
just about anywhere the rainbow ends
it's a wonderful life
life's good to me

what a wonderful life
life's good to me
oh, it's a crazy life
life's good to me
