what's she really like
the girl that you see me with
what's she really like
the one i'm so dreamy with
well, let me tell you she's wonderful
she's marvelous and she's mine
talk about her lips, her lips are so thrillable
i can't describe her kiss in words of one syllable
she's even more than adorable
and what's moreable she's all mine


you're asking if she loves me
well, you don't know the half
you're wondering if she'll leave me
ha, ha, ha, don't make me laugh


what's she really like
the girl i go on about
what's she really like
the one i'm so gone about
all i can say, she's wonderful
she's marvelous and she's mine
