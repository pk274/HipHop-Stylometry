gotta do some living
got the wanderlust
better clear the highway
'cause i'm gonna move some dust


oh. i got wheels, wheels on my heels
and i gotta keep rolling, rolling along


lots of pretty dollies
try to fence me in
but i love 'em and leave 'em
'cause a tumbleweed's my kin


oh, i got wheels, wheels on my heels
and i gotta keep rolling, rolling along


why do i keep movin'?
never settling' down?
can it be i'm looking for
a dream i haven't found?


oh, i got wheels, wheels on my heels
and i gotta keep rolling, rolling along


oh, i got wheels, wheels on my heels
and i gotta keep rolling, rolling along
