you know what it takes, you got it, baby
you are the only one i chose
i got a feeling for you, baby
and you're the only one who knows


about my troubles, troubles, troubles
when it rains, it really pours

when it rains, it really pours


you shouldn't have took away my love, dear
you know you thrill me from head to toe
you got what you wanted, now you left me
that's the way the story goes


well, i got troubles, troubles, troubles
when it rains, it really pours
