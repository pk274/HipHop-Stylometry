well, when my blue moon turns to gold again
when my rainbow turns the clouds away
well, when my blue moon turns to gold again
you'll be back within my arms to stay


when the memories that linger in our hearts
memories that make my heart grow cold
well, when someday they're gonna live again, sweetheart
and my blue moon again will turn to gold


well, when my blue moon turns to gold again
when my rainbow turns the clouds away
well, when my blue moon turns to gold again
you'll be back within my arms to stay


well, when the memories that linger in our hearts
memories that make my heart grow cold
well, when someday they're gonna live again, sweetheart
and my blue moon again will turn to gold


well, when my blue moon turns to gold again
when my rainbows turn the clouds away
well, when my blue moon turns to gold again
you'll be back within my arms to stay (stay)
