living below in this old sinful world
hardly a comfort can afford
striving alone to face temptation so
now won't you tell me
where could i go but to the lord?


where could i go? oh, where could i go?
seeking the refuge for my soul
needing a friend to save me in the end
won't you tell me
where could i go but to the lord?


life here is grand with friends i love so dear
comfort i get from god's own word
yet when i face that chilling hand of death
won't you tell me
where could i go but to the lord?


where could i go? oh, where could i go?
seeking the refuge for my soul
needing a friend to save me in the end
now won't you tell me
where could i go but to the lord?
where could i go but to the lord?
