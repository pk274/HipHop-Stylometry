once i stood in the night
with my head bowed low
in the darkness as black as could be
and my heart felt alone
and i cried, "oh lord
don't hide your face from me"


like a king, i may live
in a palace so tall
with great riches to call my own
but i don't know a thing
in this whole wide world
that's worse than being alone


hold my hand all the way
every hour every day
come here to the great unknown
take my hand, let me stand
where no one stands alone
take my hand, let me stand
where no one stands alone
