i'm dreaming of a white christmas
just like the ones i used to know
where those tree-tops glisten
and children listen
to hear sleighbells in the snow


i'm dreaming of a white christmas
with every christmas card i write
"may your day be merry and bright
and may all your christmases be white"


i-i-i'm dreaming of a white christmas
just like the ones i used to know
may your days, may your days, may your days be merry and bright
and may all your christmases be white
