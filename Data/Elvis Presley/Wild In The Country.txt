a rose grows wild in the country
a tree grows tall as the sky (as the sky)
the wind blows wild in the country
and part of the wild, wild country, am i

wild, wild, like the deer and the dove
wild and free is this land that i love


a dream grows wild in the country
a love grows tall as the sky
a heart beats wild in the country
and here with a dream in my heart
part of the wild, wild country, am i
part of the wild, wild country, am i
