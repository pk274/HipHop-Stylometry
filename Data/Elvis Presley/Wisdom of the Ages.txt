listen to the wisdom of the ages
listen to the words of many sages


live each day as if it were your last
it's written in the stars, your destiny is cast
and that hourglass runs too fast, no doubt
for the sands of time are running out


listen to the wisdom of the ages
these words can be found in history's pages


live each day, for happiness can't wait
and love while you may, but heed the hand of fate
if the finger points, it's too late, no doubt
for the sands of time are running out
but the man who turns and escapes somehow


is the wisest of men
and to such a man i'd bow
