without him i could do nothing
without him i'd surely fail
without him i would be drifting
like a ship without a sail


without him i would be dying
without him i'd be enslaved
without him life would be worthless
but with jesus, thank god i'm saved


oh jesus, oh jesus
do you know him today?
please don't turn him away
oh jesus, my jesus
without him how lost i would be
without him how lost i would be
