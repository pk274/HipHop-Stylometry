flip, flop with kay-eye
what a cutie pie i see
hoop shoopa doo-wah
lips of honey that's for me


shim sham shimmie
wanna howl and shout, there's no doubt
i saw you standing against the wall
i whistled and i gave my all
now don't tell me you don't fall
for that wolf call


just a little kiss will put me in a whirl
i'll never whistle baby at another girl
you love me well we'll have a ball
why do you try to stall
now don't tell me you don't fall
for that wolf call
for that wolf call
for that wolf call
