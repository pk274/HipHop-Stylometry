her eyes tell the story so well
she tries hard to hide
so little expected
too often neglected
a woman stripped of her pride


always so careful not to cry
until i fall asleep
and there in the silence
she lies with a tear on her cheek


the thought comes to mind
that i've failed somehow
for things i can't quite recall

a man without love is only half a man
but a woman is nothing at all

she knows i don't love her
although heaven knows i've tried
her reason for living
is to go right on giving
the one thing that she's been denied

without any warning
in the wee hours of the morning
she cries
the hurt deep inside she tries so to hide
is beginning to show in her eyes

and a thought comes to mind that i've relive sometimes
for here it i can't quite recall


that a man without love's only half a man
but a woman is nothing at all
yeah, a man without love's only half a man
but a woman is nothing at all
