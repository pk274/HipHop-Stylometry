can't you see i love you
please don't break my heart in two
that's not hard to do
'cause i don't have a wooden heart

and if you say goodbye
then i know that i would cry
maybe i would die
'cause i don't have a wooden heart

there's no strings upon this love of mine
it was always you from the start

treat me nice, treat me good
treat me like you really should
'cause i'm not made of wood
and i don't have a wooden heart


muss i denn, muss i denn
zum stadtele hinaus
stadtele hinaus
und du, mein schatz, bleibst hier?
there's no strings upon this love of mine
it was always you from the start


sei mir gut, sei mir gut
sei mir wie du wirklich sollst
wie du wirklich sollst
'cause i don't have a wooden heart
