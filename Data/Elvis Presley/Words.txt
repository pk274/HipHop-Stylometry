smile an everlasting smile
a smile could bring you near to me
don't ever let me find you're gone
cause that could bring a tear to me


this world has lost its glory
let's start a brand new story now, my love
right now, there'll be no other time
and i can show you all, my love


talk and everlasting words
and dedicate them all to me
and i will give you all my life
it's here if you should call to me


you think that i don't even mean
a single word i say
it's only words and words are all i have
to take your heart away

play it james


you think that i don't even mean
a single word i say
it's only words and words are all i have
to steal your heart away

it's only words and words are all i have
to steal your heart away
it's only words and words are all i have
to steal your heart away, heart away, ya baby
