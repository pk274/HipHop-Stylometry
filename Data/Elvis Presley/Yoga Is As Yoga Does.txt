well i can see that you and yoga will never do


yoga is as yoga does there's no in-between
you're either with it on the ball or you've blown the scene
i can see looking at you, you just can't get settled
how can i even move, twisting like a pretzel


yoga is as yoga does
there's no in-between
you're either with it all the way
or you've blown the scene
(or you've blown the scene)


come on come on, untwist my legs
pull my arms a lot
how did i get so tied up
in this yoga knot
you tell me just how i can take this yoga serious
when all it ever gives to me is a pain in my posteriors


yoga is as yoga does
there's no in-between
you're either with it all the way
or you've blown the scene
(or you've blown the scene)


stand upside down on your head, feet against the wall
a simple yoga exercise done by one and all
now cross your eyes and hold your breath, look just like a clown
yoga's sure to catch you if you come falling down


yoga is as yoga does
there's no in-between
you're either with it all the way
or you've blown the scene
