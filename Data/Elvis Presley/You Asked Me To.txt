long ago and far away
in my old common labor shoes
i turned the world all which-a-way
just because you asked me to


likened to no other feel
simple love is simple truth
there's no end to what i'd do
just because you asked me to


let the world call me a fool
let it things are right with me and you
that's all that matters and i'll do
anything you ask me to


knowing how much i love you
after all, i've been through
i'd turn and walk away from you
just because you asked me to


let the world call me a fool
let it things are right with me and you
that's all that matters and i'll do
anything you ask me to
