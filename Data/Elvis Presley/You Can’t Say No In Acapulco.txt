you can't say no in acapulco
with every beat, your heart will answer yes
where lovers sing instead of talk
and dance instead of walk together
in a night that's filled with stars
and strumming guitars


you can't say no in acapulco
where romance blooms and love is in the air
so kiss me tender, love me true
darling, don't you feel this magic too?
don't say no, you can't say no in acapulco

you can't say no in acapulco
where romance blooms and love is in the air
so kiss me tender, love me true
darling, feel this magic too?
don't say no, you can't say no in acapulco
don't say no, you can't say no in acapulco
