you give your hand to me
and then you say hello
and i can hardly speak
my heart is beating so
and anyone can tell
you think you know me well
but you don't know me


no, you don't know the one
who thinks of you at night
and longs to kiss your lips
and longs to hold you tight
to you i am just a friend
and that's all i've ever been
no, you don't know me


for i never knew the art of making love
no, my heart aches with love for you
afraid and shy, i let my chance go by
the chance that you might love me too


you give your hand to me
and then you say goodbye
i watch you walk away
beside the lucky guy
to never, never know
the one who loves you so
no, you don't know me
