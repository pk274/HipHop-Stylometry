baby you've been lying to me now i'm onto you
it's the same old song but it doesn't ring true


that's right you're wrong again
time to change and put you on your own again
you've had your way too long
time for me to be moving on


you gotta stop, you're wrong again
stop  that song again


you've been stepping' out wild and fancy free
now you've had your fun and you're running back to me
it just can't be if there's no harmony
then stop!
that's all let's break it up
you've had me fooled now i'm working' up
i see right through your lies
you made me open my eyes




it's too late now i've made up my mind
being here with you is just a waste of time

nothing to say so i'll be on my way
stop!




it's too late now i've made up my mind
being here with you is just a waste of time


it just can't be if there's no harmony
then stop! stop! you're wrong again
stop that song again
stop! you're wrong again
you gotta stop that song again
stop!
