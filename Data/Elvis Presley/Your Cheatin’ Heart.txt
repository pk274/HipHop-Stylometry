your cheating heart will make you weep
you'll cry and cry and try to sleep
but sleep won't come the whole night through
your cheating heart will tell on you


when tears come down like falling rain
you'll toss around and call my name
you're gonna walk that floor the way that i do
your cheatin' heart will tell on you

when tears come down like falling rain
you'll toss around and call my name
you're gonna walk that floor just the way that i do
your cheatin' heart will tell on you


your cheatin' heart will tell on you
your cheatin' heart will tell on you
