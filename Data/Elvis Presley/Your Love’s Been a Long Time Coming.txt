the first time i saw you i knew i was hooked on somebody other than me
the first time i held you, your soft lips and blue eyes
were as far as my eyes could see

yes here in my arms i knew i had found the reason that i'm living for
and i felt the feeling, such a wonderful feeling
that i'd never felt before


baby, your love's been a long time coming
baby your love's got a hold on me
baby your love's sure got me humming
baby your love's been a long time coming


deep in my heart there's a feeling i never knew
until i saw a love that was very new
i'm going to tell everyone what good love can do




baby, your love's been a long time coming
baby your love's got a hold on me
