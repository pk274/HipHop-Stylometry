your mama don't dance and your daddy don't rock and roll
your mama don't dance and your daddy don't rock and roll
but when evening rolls around and it's time to go to town
where do you go to rock and roll?


the old folks say that you got to end your date by ten
if you're out on a date and you bring it home late, it's a sin
there just ain't no excuse and you know you're going to lose and never win
i'll say it again




you pull into a drive-in, you find a place to park
you hop into the backseat where you know it's nice and dark
you're just about to groove, and you're thinking it's a breeze
then there's a light in your eye, and then a guy says
out of the car long hair, oowee
you're coming with me-the local police
