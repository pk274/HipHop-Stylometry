your time hasn't come yet, baby
you got a lot of dreams to go
your time hasn't come yet, baby
but when it does your heart will know


you're gonna be a beautiful woman
because you're such a beautiful child
and when you start to bloom just like a rose in june
i bet the schoolboys all go wild, but right now


your time hasn't come yet, baby
you got a few dreams to go
your time hasn't come yet, baby
but when it does your heart will know


your life's still a lollipop heaven
with teddy bears at the foot of your bed
the little boy next door who only makes you sore
is gonna some day turn your head but right now


your time hasn't come yet, baby
you got a few dreams to go
your time hasn't come yet, baby
but when it does your heart will know


you're going to grow over night into a lady
with a devastatingly smile
and then a lucky guy will see you
and want to walk you down the aisle, but meanwhile


your time hasn't come yet, baby
you got a few dreams to go
your time hasn't come yet, baby
but when it does your heart will know


but when it does your heart will know
but when it does your heart will know
