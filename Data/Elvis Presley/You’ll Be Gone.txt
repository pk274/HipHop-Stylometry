sweetheart we're alone
and you are mine
let's make this night a night to remember
don't make our love a cold dying ember
for with the dawn, you'll be gone
hold me close in your arms as the night withers away
let's not waste one precious kiss while we're together
oh please come to my arms and say you'll love me forever
for with the dawn, you'll be gone


sweetheart when you're near
my heart is aflame
your lips pressed on mine is heaven descending
and i could die because it is ending
for with the dawn, you'll be gone
let these passions we feel in our hearts never end
i could never share this feeling with another
oh please say that you feel the same knowing no other
for with the dawn, you'll be gone
for with the dawn, you'll be gone
for with the dawn, you'll be gone
for with the dawn, you'll be gone
