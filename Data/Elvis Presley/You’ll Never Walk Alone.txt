when you walk through a storm hold your head up high
and don't be afraid of the dark
at the end of a storm is a golden sky
and the sweet silver song of a lark
walk on through the wind
walk on through the rain
tho' your dreams be tossed and blown
walk on, walk on with hope in your heart
and you'll never walk alone
you'll never, ever walk alone


walk on, walk on with hope in your heart
and you'll never walk alone
you'll never, ever walk alone
