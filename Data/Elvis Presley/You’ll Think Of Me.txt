i'm sorry now, girl, but i must leave you
there's something deep inside my soul keeps calling me
the winter wind, girl, will not deceive you
and in your cold and empty bed, you'll think of me, oh yes
you'll think of me


you'll see me coming, you'll see me going
don't ask me why, i'm just the kind needs to be free
just like that outlaw wind keeps on a-blowing
yeah, in your cold and empty bed, you'll think of me, oh yes
you'll think of me


now i know you loved me just like i wanted
i know you'd follow me across an endless sea
but, baby, i've got a heart that's haunted
yeah, in your cold and empty bed, you'll think of me, oh yes
you'll think of me


ah but you should know, girl, that i'll be crying
out on that lonely road where not a soul can see
i'll shed my tears for a love that's dying
yeah, in your cold and empty bed, you'll think of me, oh yes
you'll think of me


the summer sun, girl, will bring a stranger
and he'll be better to you than i used to be
and when he takes you into his arms, girl
well, in your warm and loving bed, you won't think of me, no, no
you won't think of me


then in your warm and loving bed, you won't think of me, no, no
you won't think of me
