you're a heartbreaker
you're a love faker
a heartbreaker playing with fire
you're a tear snatcher
you're a quarrel patcher
but you can't break my heart anymore
for i have just found someone else
who's sure to take your place
someone i can always trust
and to fill this empty space


you're a heartbreaker
you're a love faker
but you can't break my heart anymore


you're a smooth talker
you're a real cool walker
but now you have talked out of turn
you're a high stepper
you're an eye-catcher
but you won't catch my glances any more
for i have just found someone else
who's sure to take your place
someone i can always trust
and to fill this empty space


you're a heartbreaker
you're a love faker
but you can't break my heart anymore


you're a heartbreaker
