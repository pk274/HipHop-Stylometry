you never close your eyes
anymore when i kiss your lips
there's no tenderness
like before in your fingertips
you're trying hard not to show it
but baby, baby i know it


you've lost that loving feeling
whoa that loving feeling
you've lost that loving feeling, now it's gone, gone, gone


there's no tenderness in your eyes
when i reach out for you
girl, you're starting to criticize
every little thing that i do
it makes me just feel like crying
oh baby, something beautiful's dying


you've lost that loving feeling
whoa that loving feeling
you've lost that loving feeling
now it's gone, gone, gone





baby, baby, i get down on my knees for you
if this suit weren't too tight!
if you would only love me like you used to do
we had a love, love, love, love you don't find every day
oh don't, don't, don't, don't take it away
listen to me, talking to you


bring back that loving feeling
whoa that loving feeling
bring back that loving feeling
now it's gone, gone, gone
and i can't go on
