you never close your eyes
anymore when i kiss your lips
there's no tenderness
like before in your fingertips


you're trying hard not to show it
but baby, baby i know it


you've lost that lovin' feelin'
whoa that lovin' feelin'
you've lost that loving feeling
now it's gone, gone, gone, whoa-oh-oh


there's no tenderness in your eyes
when i reach out for you
girl, you're starting to criticize
every little thing that i do


it makes me just feel like cryin'
oh, baby, something beautiful's dyin'


you've lost that lovin' feelin'
whoa that lovin' feelin'
you've lost that lovin' feelin'
now it's gone, gone, gone


baby, baby, i get down on my knees for you
if this suit weren't too tight!
if you would only love me like you used to do
we had a love, love, love, love you don't find every day
oh, don't, don't, don't, don't take it away
listen to me, talking to you


bring back that lovin' feelin'
whoa that lovin' feelin'
bring back that lovin' feelin'
now it's gone, gone, gone
and i can't go on
