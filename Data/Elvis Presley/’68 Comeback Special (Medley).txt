well, since my baby left me
well, i found a new place to dwell
well, it's down at the end of lonely street
at heartbreak hotel


where i'll be, i'll be so lonely, baby
i'll be so lonely
i'll be so lonely, i could die


well, the bellhop's tears keep flowin'
and the desk clerk's dressed in black
well, they've been so long on lonely street
they'll never, never look back


they get so lonely, baby
they get so lonely
they get so lonely, they could die


you ain't nothin' but a hound dog
sniffin' at my door
you ain't nothin' but a hound dog
cryin' all the time
well, you ain't never caught a rabbit
you ain't no friend of mine, no


well, it's one for the money, two for the show
three to get ready, now go, cat, go


but don't you step on my blue suede shoes
well, you can do anything, but stay off of my blue suede shoes


well, it's blue, blue, my blue suede shoes, yeah
blue, blue, my blue suede shoes, baby
blue, blue, my blue suede shoes
blue, blue, my blue suede
you can do anything, but lay off of my blue suede shoes


warden threw a party in the county jail
the prison band was there and they began to wail
the band was jumpin' and the joint began to swing
you shoulda heard them knocked out jailbirds sing


let's rock, alright, everybody, let's rock
everybody in the whole cell block
was dancin' to the jailhouse rock


dancin' to the jailhouse rock
dancin' to the jailhouse rock
dancin' to the jailhouse rock
dancin' to the jailhouse rock


well, they were dancin'
they were dancin'
to the jailhouse rock, alright
alright
