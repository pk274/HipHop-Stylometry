"you know, people just don't...
people just don't see
how much work is really involved in this rap shit
i didn't know it, i didn't see it
i never saw it until i was actually in it
you really gotta be in it
to understand what it's like
but you always gotta
people always gotta see you smile
you always gotta put on that fake...
you know what i'm sayin'?
no matter what you just been through
shit has gotta be right"
