i'll shove a gun in your grill, greasy and heated
smothered in hot mustard so when i feed it to you it's easy to eat it
you need to be immediately treated
while you're breathing
and you'll be leaving the receiving room this evening with jesus
you hate on us? we'll be waiting on eight corners
swarming your hood with a thousand angry skateboarders
i'll hop in a jeep and slam on the gas and charge you
and bombard you in the car that your mom bought you
fuck around and get choked and found in a moat
floating around, drowned, faced-down in a boat
i'll pile five dudes in a pinto and pull-up to the seven mile drive through
at mcdonald's and pile-drive you
i got the power to snatch a driver out of his eddie bauer
when it drives by me at 90 miles an hour
this place is my house
i might as well erase my face with white-out
cause y'all can't see me like mase's eyebrows

i'm keeping it raw, illegal like malik and jamal
'cause i don't believe in the law, like i'm steven seagal
flipping off the police while i'm leaping a wall
take a bunch of tylenol, then fall asleep in a mall
i got your little son, you'll be receiving a call
you're lucky this little punks still breathing at all
fuck the world, this how i get even at y'all
pop shit, get rolled up and leave in a ball
i hit you in your mouth and sink your teeth in your jaws
you won't be able to eat shit, not even a malt
this lethal assault, is giving you a reason to stall
i'm cocking this deuce-deuce and i'm squeezing it off
at the first burp and a fart sniffle a sneeze and a cough
get your arm chewed off like you was teasing a dog
i'm cold enough and hot enough to freeze and unthaw
i'll kick my girl out, in 10 degrees in her bra


i wouldn't risk it...
rappers get hit with this verbal biscuit
hey yo, yo, yo, yo, yo
keep the same beat, keep the same beat, keep the same beat
it goes like this, yo
my attitude is worse than n.w.a.'s was
i'll battle you over stupid shit and diss people
who ain't have shit to do with it, like cool j does
you see me standing outside of your building screaming
puffy is good, but slim shady is for the children!
i look at my life in a new light -- fuck it
give me two mics; i write songs for me -- fuck what you like
you're probably hear me rap half-hearted; cause i don't like rap anyway
i'm just trying to get my porno career started
every place and event.. (been there, done that)
shit, dre stuck me in a suitcase when he went
want a deal? study these 5 chapters
lesson one: throw demos as hard as you can at signed rappers
lesson two: face 'em and diss 'em
don't give 'em a demo; kidnap 'em
and make 'em come to your basement and listen
lesson three: get a job at a label; switch demos with canibus
and put yours on the owner's table
lesson four: know you heard this before:
"hey let me get your number; i'll call you tomorrow, for sure!"
don't act like a fan -- you wanna get signed?
get the whitest a&r you can find
pull him aside and rap as wack as you can
lesson five: get a hook-up at jive
dress up like i.c.p and have them come see you perform live
and that's the key, but when you see me on the street; i ain't
givin you shit bitch - don't even bother asking me
toilet water splashes me right in the ass when i'm spitting
cause i'm always shitting when i'm rapping like master p
got a blowjob from paula jones, and stuffed it so far in her mouth
my balls broke both of her collarbones
told mya this shit was all about me-ah
gave alyssa milano syphillis, mono and gonorrhea
and all three of my main girls said see-ya
cause brandy and monica walked in and caught me fucking aaliyah
i splish splash while i'm taking a bath
grab a handful of pills, break em in half, take em and laugh
white trash -- fucking your wife in the ass
while you're out siphoning gas for your lawnmower to cut the grass

and it's like that, and it's like that


yo, weed lacer, '97 burgundy blazer
wanted for burglary, had to ditch the mercury tracer
i’m on some loc shit, some fed up with the being broke shit
i’m not to joke with, bitch i don’t sell crack, i smoke it
having a coke fit, going through withdrawls daily
shoot-up with mescaline in front of my baby daughter hailie
my brain’s dusted, i’m disgusted at all my habits
too many aspirin tablets, empty medicine cabinets
losing battles to wack rappers cause i’m always too blunted
walking up in the cypher smoking, talking about “who want it?”
thug and a crook; every drug in the book; i’ve done it
my 9’s at your brain, is that you chain? run it
crews die from an overdosage of excessive flavor
aggressive nature got me sticking you for your progressive pager
spectacular, crystal-meth manufacturer
stole your momma’s acura, wrecked it, and sold it back to her
boosting nike jackets, escaped from psychiatrics
told the nurse to save my bed for me, i might be back bitch
so barricade your entrance, put up some extra fences
a woman beater, wanted for repeated sex offenses
chasing dips – take them on long vacation trips
kidnapping ‘em and trapping ‘em in abusive relationships
fuck up your face and lips, slit your stomach and watch your gut split
cut you with that razor that i use to shave my nuts with
mama, don’t you cry, your son is too far gone
i’m so high, i don’t even know what label i’m on
i’m fucked up, i feel just like an overworked plumber
i’m sick of this shit, what’s dr. kevorkian’s phone number?


some people say i'm strange, i tell them ain't shit change
i'm still the same lame asshole with a different name
who came late to the last show with a different dame
brain ate from the last o that i sniffed of cane
you know you're spaced the fuck out like george lucas
when your puke is turning to yellowish-orange mucus
so when i grab a pencil and squeeze it between fingers
i'm not a rapper, i'm a demon who speaks english
freak genius, too extreme for the weak and squeemish
burn you alive till you screaming to be extinguished
cause when i drop the science, motherfuckers tell me to stop the violence
start a fire and block the hydrants
i'm just a mean person, you never seen worse than
so when slim gets this m-16 bursting
you getting spun backwards like every word of obscene cursing
on the b-side of my first single with the clean version
stopping your short life when you still a teen virgin
unless you get a kidney specialist and a spleen surgeon
in the best hospital possible for emergency surgery
to try to stop the blood from your ruptured sternum internally
i'll take it back before we knew each others' name
run in the ultrasound and snatch you out your mother's frame
i'll take it further back than that
back to lovers lane, to the night you were thought of
and cock block your father's game
i'll plead the fifth like my jaws were muzzled
so suck my dick while i take a shit and do this crossword puzzle
and when i'm down with ten seconds left in the whole bout
i'm gonna throw a head-butt so hard, it'll knock us both out
