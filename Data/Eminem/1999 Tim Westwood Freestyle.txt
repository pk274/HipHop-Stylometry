tim westwood, marley marl and slim shady and mc proof
proof on my side, my sidekick
y'all can suck my wide -ick
said the "ick" without the d in front of it
none of you rappers want none of it
i’ll put you on punishment like big pun
wanna suck my "ick-ick"? here's a big one
i'll do it with the fluid that i’m spillin'
i'm illin', plus i'm chillin', i'm not a villain
forget the controversy surroundin' me
and all these fake-ass press people surroundin’ me, houndin’ me
but i don't give a damn ’cause i smoked a pound of weed
y'all don't want none of me
so get from in front of me like chuck d
all the these bitches wanna walk up and fuck me
whoops! did i say that or did i think it?
i don't know but my brain starts shrinkin’
my spine starts shrivelin', givin' 'em adrenaline
when i'm killin' 'em and no dnr for benylin
and this is right off the top
take a bottle of pop and bit off the top
tim, i said that last time when i was on your show
but it really doesn't matter 'cause i kick this slowest flow
with a flow that's slow, really doesn't matter
said it backwards, but all you fake-ass rappers are actors
and i'ma bring it to ya
you got a life and you got a song
but don't know how to sing it, do ya?
no you don't, so i'ma kill it
i'ma cook a cracked egg in a skillet and eat it
and smoke it and whatever, take my dick and poke it
blastin' off right now!


proof!
mc proof, here on the mic raise the roof
kill 'em like 180-proof
d12, d12, d12 (d12)
too many white and black people i been gnarly
rockin' with tim westwood and mr. marley
it's time for us to do y'all, who y'all?
we break balls like cue balls, while y'all switch up like rupaul
it's true y'all don't wanna mess around with us
a lotta people i been with is dangerous
why's this beat so fast?
i know


wow, this beats are a little bit too fast for my headache
but i don't give a damn, someone call a paramedic
'cause i'm pathetic, i need a little bit of excedrin to make my damn head spin
i'll do a head spin, a windmill and then chill, and then kill (westwood!)
whatever, i'm clever with these beat that i kick over these techniques
like technique 12 inches, i get blunted
and any rapper that wants it, don't want it
they kick in front it, right to their face
i give, i'ma smackin' it and i don't give a damn
'cause i got proof backin' it
y'all don't wanna step to me
you put your life in jeopardy
y'all better choose your mother— weaponry
ayo proof, get on the mic
show these mother— what it's like


all you motherf— goin' get f— up now
aw man
no cussin', no potions, slow motion, jack off with no lotion
i'm slower than the flow in the ocean
i can cause an explosion, to knock water out of an ocean
when i'm coastin', jumpin' the rowboat and start flowin' in it
i brought the microphone, my -ick i'm totin' it
like a glock that cock
i rock the microphone and rock the spot
and rappers jock a lot, proof come in whether you're wack or not (these voices)
or dope or not (these voices)
(i hear them, i hear them voices)
(these voices i hear them)
(and when they talk i'll follow)
(i'll follow, i'll follow, i'll follow all these voices)
(these voices i hear them)
(and when they talk i'll follow)
(i'll follow, i'll follow, i'll follow)


yo, yo, yo, i'ma give you this hot beat
marley marl style
go ahead, proof
slim shady, marley marl joint exclusive freestyle


yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, hold on, hold on, hold on (holdin' on)
this beat a little bit too happy for my stinkin' self
nah, this is nice, this is nice
this is some explicit shit that y'all can't get with
get my wrists slit, i ain't a nit wit
but i'll smoke weed and pass out like a sampling snippet
y'all don't wanna hear me rip it
y'all don't wanna hear me flip it
i biggity-biggity-biggity-whoopsie
like das efx, you get a broken neck
my textbook, take a next look
y'all don't wanna understand the way that i just come off at the top
and i can always drop everything that i stop
or everything that i keep goin' and keep flowin'
like the energizer bunny, that's why it's funny
when rappers try to step to me and try to step to me
and battle me for money, 'cause you're a dummy
'cause anything that you could say i could use against you (westwood!)
and i can slice your ass like a chem suit
let me continue, put the shit on the menu
rappers don't wanna step to me
because 
paul rosenberg
i'd like to thank y'all for comin' by, man
