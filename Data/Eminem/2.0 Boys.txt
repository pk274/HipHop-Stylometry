oh!
told you, (uh), game over


fuck! it's fucking raining, shit! there's lightning, bitch!
it's thundering 'cause i'm cussing up a storm if you wondering, shit!
shit! you couldn't muster up enough thought
just take a dump during a brain fart, chump
if you want urine in your face, all you had to do was say
that you wish you would've just stayed pissed off in the first place
we came to monopolize the game, illuminati is here
yeah, human oddities, at odds with us your squad's gotta be
'cause we started out cold in a snowball, we froze
soon as we rolled up on these hoes, all's we know
is y'all lowered the bar like limbo, you know who you are
so quit fucking the dog before we start calling you bizarre
shit, screw the pooch, y'all done raped a pitbull
fell in love with the shih tzu, this missile's directed directly at you
and this for these hoes who don't know me from a can of paint
you must be huffing, fuck a ball sack
if the taints can't take you on a date, you mistake me for a gentleman
you 2000 and late, man, and will i ain't, i'm the bad guy
type of guy that will drag five girls up on stage
pour ice in their pants, and the first one who pees gets a black eye


must be outta your mind
you think you fucking with us
suck on these nuts, bitch, hang it up
this game is over


must be outta your mind
you think you fucking with us
suck on these nuts, bitch, hang it up
this game is over


yo, i don't think they heard you, tell 'em again
game over!
