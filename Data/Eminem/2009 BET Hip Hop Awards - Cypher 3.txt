like a dope fiend openin' up a bottle of dopamine
you're just hopin' he don’t get rope for your throat to choke anythin'
oh, and just think how dope he could be if he smoked anythin'
oh, there goes the bell — the sound of the openin' ding
i hit you as hard as barbiturates in the ribs
with a switch and stitch you at the same time before you can flinch to it
my **** is so big, if i add another inch to it
you would swear when i ***** you that you was actually into it
i'm not a baller, but you can bet your fuckin' bottom dollar
that i remember when i was without a dollar bill in my wallet
now, watch me kill a koala while i maul a chihuahua
bum a pill off of paula like, "let me holler at you, mama"
it's like i'm off the bombom when i bring the ******' drama
used to bomb ya like saddam, but now that i'm a little calmer
i'm a ******' cross between osama, dahmer, obama and dalai lama
tell miley i'm her knight in shinin' armor
mail a gift to taylor swift's trailer a picture of my genitalia
with a note sayin', "*****, i can't wait to **** ya"
drug paraphernalia, beware, the werewolf will kill ya
that's him in his sheep's clothes, he just shaved his hair off, cecilia
