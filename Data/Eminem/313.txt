look, so what you know about a sweet mc in the 313?
you don't know shit so when you see one, flee
you can be run-d, you'll never be the mc
i stopped the alphabet at s and got it down to a t
i'm sure you're bound to agree, a sweet mc crash the spot
i make the roof hot like i was rock master scott
your ass forgot, so just in case you don't remember me
i'll run your brain around the block to jog your fuckin' memory
it's either them or me, man, kill or be killed
your will'll be sealed, your casket closed, you still'd be billed
my facility's filled with fans packed to capacity
i'll send a rapper back with the crack of his ass shitty (ha)
if he's actin' soft and he cowers
he better come cleaner than jeru jackin' off when he showers
you flowers got no clout with a thing
you could date a stick of dynamite and wouldn't go out with a bang
i shout with a slang simple as abc's
skip over the d's and rock the microphone with ease
dethrone mcs and i'ma max alone
relax your dome, like a solo from a saxophone
so facts are known, biters get treated with shots
i rock a beat harder than you could beat it with rocks
i'm greeted with flocks of fellow followers' singers
you couldn't make the fans throw up their hands if they swallowed their fingers
but you can bring yours, let's see what you got
but don't front, and never try to be what you're not
'cause you can be quick, jump the candlestick, burn your back
and fuck jill on a hill, but you still ain't jack
