who tryin' to be the first one to catch this blade in the throat?
you know the po-po don't let me hold them toasters no mo'
i just clapped three people, you gon' be number four
if you don't back the fuck up, and get the fuck up off the flo'
my crew is takin' over as soon as we hit the do'
you hit the door, but we comin' in and you goin' home
security, they can't even stop us because they know
runyon avenue soldiers hold us down wherever we go
chuggin' on our 40s and holdin' our .44s
we come with toasters like we just opened savings and loans
and we don't need your brew tonight, homie, we brought our own
so grab whatever you sippin' on and let's get it on!
