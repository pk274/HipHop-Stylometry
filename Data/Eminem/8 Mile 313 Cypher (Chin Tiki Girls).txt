come on, man. come on, man
kick that shit, baby, come on
come on, man
uh, uh, watch that nigga kick this shit, uh
uh
alright, speed it up a little bit, iz
come on, baby
alright, look
yo, yo


your style is generic, mine's authentic-made
i roll like a renegade, you need clinic aid
my technique's bizarre and ill; i scar and kill
you were a star until i served you like a bar and grill
as i proceed to cook and grill ya, that's all it took to kill ya
you better recognize me like i look familiar
you wanna battle? you beat around the bush
like you're scared to lick pussy, so you eat around the tush
i need a clown to push, someone that i can bully
wait a minute, i donâ€™t think you understand fully
see me without a style's like mustard without the heinz
i lead the new school, you're a busta without the rhymes
i crush the shit out your line
