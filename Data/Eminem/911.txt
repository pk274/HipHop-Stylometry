woo-hoo! *laughs*
guess who's back?!
mommy, we're home!
say hello to my little friends
dj muggs, soul assassins, cypress hill
everybody, put your hands where my eyes can see!


yo
everywhere we go people know we roll deep as fuck
forty, fifty samoans, they knowin' when d-bo was
50, tweezy, obie, there won't be no ho in us
they pop shit like they gonna do shit but no one does
from new york down to texas, back up to los angeles
we changed the way we move, so man up if you can't adjust
you may end up getting rushed by too many to handle us (ha)
it's funny, i guess money does have its advantages
and it isn't that we just think that we can't be touched
it's not like we're just feeling ourselves that much, it's just
that if someone ever does put us in the clutch
we just know that y'all ain't gon' be the one who's gon' do it
'cause first of all you're pussy and everybody can see that
you fuck around, get caught in a spot that you shouldn't be at
that you got no business being in, we ain't even gon' be in it
no one's gonna hear nothing, no one's gonna see this shit
and they'll be in and up out of it, them boys is 'bout it, 'bout it
the noise from clips and rounds be drowned out by the crowd
and you'll be laying on the ground getting trampled by people dancing
'til the club closes, and clears out, and that's when they see you flattened
nobody saw it happen, all 'cause your jaws are flapping
and you couldn't stop yapping and took it past rapping
it ain't about the music no more, it's 'bout trying to show off
and it feels like any minute the bomb is about to go off


shit's about to change, 'cause we ain't playin' no games
we ain't budgin', neither are they, we ain't sayin' no names
shit just ain't the same when ak's get to sprayin'
"hip-hop is in a state of 9-1-1"
it ain't about hip-hop, 'cause those days are gone
it ain't about tryna rip shots to get props no more
it's about trying not to get popped, and get dropped to the floor
'cause "hip-hop is in a state of 9-1-1"
