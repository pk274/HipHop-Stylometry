and it seems like
yesterday it was just a dream
but those days are gone
they're just memories
(oh) and it seems like
yesterday it was just a dream
but those days are gone
all right

let's pretend marshall mathers never picked up a pen
let's pretend things woulda been no different
pretend he procrastinated, had no motivation
pretend he just made excuses that were so paper thin
they could blow 'way with the wind, "marshall, you're never gonna make it
makes no sense to play the game, there ain't no way that you'll win"
pretend he just stayed outside all day and played with his friends
pretend he even had a friend to say was his friend
and it wasn't time to move and schools weren't changin' again
he wasn't socially awkward and just strange as a kid
he had a father and his mother wasn't crazy as shit
and he never dreamed he could rip stadiums and just lazy as shit
"fuck a talent show in the gymnasium, bitch!"
"you won't amount to shit—quit daydreamin', kid!"
"you need to get your cranium checked." "you're thinkin' like an alien
it just ain't realistic." now pretend
they ain't just make him angry with this shit
and there was no one he could even aim when he's pissed at
and his alarm went off to wake him, but he didn't make it
to the rap olympics, slept through his plane and he missed it
he's gon' have a hard time explainin' to hailie and lainey
these food stamps and this wic shit, ‘cause he never risked shit
he hoped, and he wished it, but it didn't fall in his lap
so he ain't even here, he pretends that—
