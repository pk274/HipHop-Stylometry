you wouldn’t like me when i’m angry
the reeboks i’m wearing turn to nike when i’m cranky
then my skin gets pale, my hair turns blonde
my shirt comes off, i throw a pair of earrings on
2 shots of bacardi and i start to hear things, dawg
the girl that i came wit' i start to spill drinks on
i get this evil little grin in the middle of my chin
then i begin cursing at each and every living person
then all my boys around me start sweating and getting nervous
i start bussing they balls right in front of they girlfriends
like, "hey, this fucking guy you’re with, think he likes you?
we had 6 whores in our room last night that looked just like you
you fucking slut, you think your dumb husband's faithful
you should be grateful he ain’t gave you aids yet, he hates you
he don’t even like to touch you
been married for 6 years and he still uses a rubber when he fucks you
and your boyfriend tells me everything, you slut
that’s my best friend, you had 6 abortions in 6 months
and they weren’t even his kids, none of my business?
i think it is, 5 of ‘em were mine, you fucking bitch"
i stand up in a chair and start to give a right hook speech
"my right could knock you all out with one swing
look at you all, you’re nothing
a bunch of fucking punks
i’ll take every last one of you cocksuckers on at once
you fucking pussies, and that slut over there
hey bitch, c’mon, i wanna fuck
you heard "my name is", i’m famous
come git some of this platinum dick"
i went triple platinum and i still start some shit
you’re triple platinum, hey, pauly, i know
c’mon little angry man, it’s time to go home
