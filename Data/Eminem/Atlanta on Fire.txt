if you opened up your ears long enough to listen
you may hear what you've been missin' out all of this time
i've been put in a position to put all this in position
so quit your bitchin', learn how to rhyme
get signed and get your shine


it's like this and like that and, uh, welcome to statlanta
shady aftermath and, uh, a brand new rapper from atlanta
who goes by the name of stat quo
introducing our new excuse to keep producin'
continue to do music, use it and expand it and make rap grow
the hottest new shit on the planet, on a new plateau
but don't confuse it, you don't understand it
let me break it down for you to show you how we do shit
so that you cats know, this is statlanta 101
cause we don't want no one walking out this motherfucker with tunnel vision
so anyone with questions you want answered
just ask and we'll try to unmask them and maybe explain why so few cats blow
just spit the truth when you get in this booth and do that though
that there boy hot to death, you already knew that though
is he the greatest from the atl, we got haters all day to debate us
so we'll just say this: he's one of them not to tackle
