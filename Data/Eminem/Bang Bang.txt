everyday it's the same thing, l.a. ain't changed
niggas still playa hating, but dre ain't changed
i'm just a lot smarter now
cause these niggas is banging ten times harder now
niggas bringing they ass up in the wrong part of town
better turn their car around
rolling the window down (hey can we talk it out?)
(nah, get the fuck out!)
johnny got a shotgun
and he ain't even strong enough to cock one
fuck trying to job hunt
niggas got ak's
niggas is way crazier than dre was back in his n.w.a. days
niggas spray strays and shoot without looking
niggas walk by and blast, without leaving a footprint
i think the attitudes are twice as worst
it takes half the time to get your whole life reversed
always trying to play rambo with they ammo
make a nigga wanna stay in family mode
