i'm just so depressed
i just can't seem to get out this slump
if i could just get over this hump
but i need something to pull me out this dump
i took my bruises, took my lumps
fell down then i got right back up
but i need that spark to get psyched back up
in order for me to pick the mic back up
i don't know how or why or when
i ended up in this position i'm in
i'm starting to feel distant again
so i decided just to pick this pen
up and try to make an attempt
to vent, but i just can't admit
or come to grips with the fact that
i may be done with rap, i need a new outlet
and i know some sh— so hard to swallow
but i just can't sit back and wallow
in my own sorrow, but i know one fact:
i'll be one tough act to follow
one tough act to follow
i'll be one tough act to follow
here today, gone tomorrow
but you'd have to walk a thousand miles—


in my shoes, just to see
what it's like to be me
i'll be you, let's trade shoes
just to see what it'd be like to
feel your pain, you feel mine
go inside each other's minds
just to see what we find
look at sh— through each other's eyes


but don't let 'em say you ain't beautiful, oh
they can all get f— just stay true to you, so
don't let 'em say you ain't beautiful, oh
they can all get f—, just stay true to you, so


i think i'm startin' to lose my sense of humor
everything's so tense and gloom
i almost feel like i gotta check the temperature
of the room, just as soon as
i walk in, it's like all eyes on me
so i try to avoid any eye contact
'cause if i do that, then it opens a door
for conversation like i want that
i'm not lookin' for extra attention
i just wanna be just like you
blend in with the rest of the room
maybe just point me to the closest restroom
i don't need no f— man servant
tryna follow me around and wipe my—
laugh at every single joke i crack
and half of 'em ain't even funny, like, "ha!
marshall, you're so funny, man
you should be a comedian!"
unfortunately i am
i just hide behind the tears of a clown
so why don't you all sit down?
listen to the tale i'm about to tell
hell, we don't gotta trade our shoes
and you ain't gotta walk no thousand miles—


in my shoes, just to see
what it's like to be me
i'll be you, let's trade shoes
just to see what it'd be like to
feel your pain, you feel mine
go inside each other's minds
just to see what we find
look at sh— through each other's eyes


but don't let 'em say you ain't beautiful, oh
they can all get f—, just stay true to you, so
don't let 'em say you ain't beautiful, oh
they can all get f—, just stay true to you, so


lately i've been hard to reach
i've been too long on my own (oh)
everybody has a private world
where they can be alone (so)
are you calling me?
are you tryin'g to get through? (oh)
are you reaching out for me?
i'm reaching out for you (so)
