god, please would you arm me with the armor
to calm me when there's drama like gandhi?
could have gone the other way many times
could have turned dalai with the llama, but i squashed my
beefs, and things seem
to be looking decent recently, but don't jinx it
it's like clint eastwood looking for peace though
maybe not finna enter the priesthood
but at least should make an attempt to
show some remorse and to be some sort of repenter
for the people, i've been a menace to
not a preacher but a shit starter and finisher
enter the mind of a thick skin, but a short temper
this patience of mine is thinner
than twine is when i
get attacked, so i might say something back
that might offend ya
so if you don't like when i rap or what i have to
say on the mic, then ya might wanna act just
like quarterbacks and take a fuckin' hike when i snap 'cause
i'm a sinner, and i, i got a best friend, best friend
plus balls and intestines
and they never been yes men
they gon' tell me when i'm fuckin' up the minute i'm ever givin' it less than
i'm about to vomit and i can feel it comin'
'cause failure's somethin' i can barely stomach
and i only listen to my gut
so unless you're my fuckin' belly button
don't tell me nuttin', you ain't my best friend, best friend
who you think i'm talkin' 'bout?
lifts me up when i'm down and out
still look to him without a doubt
still got a best friend, best friend
shout it out
like there's never been a louder mouth
should have never been allowed a mouth
now that i got a higher power, now
when i blackout, power outage—oww
they powerless, but they crowd around
they tend to flock like shepherds, the black sheep
but i'll be the worst thing that these motherfuckers ever heard
when i'm counted out
you'll be d-o-a, they'll announce
but pronounce you dead when they sound it out
so prepare for a rival, your arch enemy surrounds you now
he's all around you– pow!
not even the doctors at the hospital
are gonna shiggy-shock you back to life
it's im-piggy-possible to revive you
that's word to the diggy doc
stiggy-stoppin' is not an option
somethin' i'm not gonna do
i'm the iggy pop of hip-hop when i walk in the booth
dawg, i'm the truth, like biggie rockin' with 2pac in a suit
talkin' to proof, droppin' a deuce
fill up a syllable clip like a refillable script, cock it and shoot
and who you think's my glock that i use
that i pull from to get my strength up against these haters?
and he'll be waitin' at the gate when you get sprayed up
sendin' you hoes straight up to deal with my best friend
