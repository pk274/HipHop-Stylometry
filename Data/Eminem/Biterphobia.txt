i'm sneakin' in through the back door; booty mcs get ambushed
rammed and squooshed, slammed and pushed, crammed and mushed
then i move it on down from the right to left
so bite the method, prepare to fight to death
to get jacked, attacked, and cracked in two
smackin' through 'til you're black and blue for actin', true
i'm dreaded like a man whose hair is all strands
crews battle me, sniffin' on aerosol cans
i'm stompin' 'em, kickin' 'em, chokin' 'em, stampin' 'em
clompin' 'em, stickin' 'em, pokin' 'em, clampin' 'em
to electric chairs and tightenin' bolts
hit 'em with frightening jolts of lightning bolts
i'm zappin' rappers, singers, and dancers
faster than you can snap your fingers for answers
cancer is in the flesh, alive and breathin'
survivin' by connivin' and thievin'


i had a dream i was gettin' jacked by biters
it felt like i was bein' attacked by spiders
developing a fear from biterphobia
i'm holdin' a gas can and lighter over ya
if i detect ya, i'ma pulverize
dissect your brain, diggin' in your skull for lies
then i'ma torture
with material iller than a stark ravin' mad serial killer
i'm more dangerous than a loaded chamber is
a major risk to a plagiarist
so, beware of the aura
a terror the horrible will scare ya tomorrow
it's the airborne assault of the rappers
either start developing skills
or head for the border and run like hell up in hills
the choice is yours
besides, all these noises force me to scream 'til my voice is hoarse
'cause i'm sick of these jabber jaws
and crabs that grab at yours
and saboteurs that bite like labradors
you're in range of my double-barrel, and your life is in danger, trouble, and peril


i trample and stamp liars like they were campfires
'cause vampires bite on my balls and clamp pliers and swing on my big thingamajig
so, i'm bringin' my nig, proof, for backup when i sing at my gig
'cause biters are fallin' head over heels in love with every rhyme that i've said over reels
that's how i became paranoid
chewing my fingernails, pulling my hair, annoyed
'cause every time you bit, it was deliberate
so, i'm forced to hit a little quicker with an ultimatum
i assault and slayed 'em with rhymes and insults
and made 'em difficult to fade 'em
energetic and imaginative pronouns and verbs
predicates and adjectives will reach out and grab you nine times out of ten
that's why i'm spitting one-of-a-kind rhymes out a pen
