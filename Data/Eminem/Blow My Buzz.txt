yo, yo, yo, yo
schizophrenia, how many of ya got it?
how many motherfuckers can say they psychotic?
how many motherfuckers can say they brain dry-rotted from pot?
you got it like i got it or not?
if you did, you would know just what i'm talking bout
when your tongue's rotting out from cotton-mouth
when you end up becoming so dependent on weed
that you end up spending a g in the vending machine
you got the munchies, look at you, junk food junkie
potato chips and lunch meat, up in the front seat
sometimes you can get so paranoid from ganja
that's it gotcha thinking the whole world is watching ya
or maybe you don't smoke, maybe you just roll
but whatever your drug's yo, go for the gusto
just don't come fuck with me when i'm doing my drugs
you see me in the club don't come fucking my high up and


{*ding dong*} bitch let me in the house (the game on?)
no, i just came to eat your mother out
it's the big guy, doing a butterfly to the ground (go 'head!)
bizarre, sit yo' nasty ass down!
i spot this fat bitch from across the room
now suck my dick while your boyfriend's in the bathroom (yea-yea!)
my face is pink, looking for a sink
and don't worry bout what i put in your drink (ha-ha-ha-ha)
it's called a date-rape drug, ten minutes you'll be fucked up
open your nasty-ass legs up (yeah, you whore)
bitches i'm catching, blunts i'm matching
don't call me bizarre, i'm the reverend jesse jackson
