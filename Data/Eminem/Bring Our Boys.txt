dirty dozen is the clique so walk right over and lynch ya'
rip the ass right out ya' pants like a doberman pinscher
like the cobra and ninja, my intention's to injure
and prevent ya from enterin' from an inch of my center
or get your motherfuckin' pants split at the creases
fuckin' you intellectually
givin' you mental sexually transmitted diseases
my duty is to keep a stranger barred
i guard my sector like a saint bernard and this ain't your yard
bringin' the noise like a trigger happy gun slinger
droppin' your whole clique with one finger 'til none linger
beware of my dogs attackin' like a pack of great danes
chargin' like freight trains through the great plains
