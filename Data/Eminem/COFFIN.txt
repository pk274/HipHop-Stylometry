i don't really wanna fight (nah)
i just wanna spend the night (yeah)
but i don't wanna spend the night
actin' out "love the way you lie"
but the shit just went awry
hit me in the eye, bit me in the thigh, then begin to cry
i'm at the end of my wits, let's end this, ma (it's over)
then begin again tomorrow
fresh start, let you spoil me
pledge your loyalty, treat me like a king
just to fuck me over royally
boy, are we water mixed with oil
see another shouting match, 'bout to have it out
but no matter how mad i get, i'm so mad about you
forgot what i was even mad about
i know we've had our challenges still
i keep trying to salvage it, you
wanna sabotage it, i'm down to the hill
but you think i'm fucking around on you, chill
it never changes, i doubt if it will
cheat on me, then say "how does it feel?"
i feel like blowing my fucking head off
after i write you out of my will
bitch, how could you?
almost had a child wit' you
woulda settled down wit' you
now i'll put you in the ground and bury myself wit' you
i don't get you, it's as if you're drowning
i stick my hand out, but you fool me
you're just trying to pull me down wit' you (down wit' you)
thought it was you my world revolve around
i should aim a revolver round at you
180 proof, guess i'm making my way to the roof
you're a traitor, i say that we're through
you hop in the elevator, then you
say the coffin, they better make it for two
'cause if you jump, i'm jumpin' with you
and neither one of us have nothing to lose but each other
we're just a couple of fools
