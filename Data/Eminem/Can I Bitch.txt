(i, i wanna grow up too)
"uncle marshall, will you tell us a bedtime story?"
here we go!

now, once upon a time not long ago
there was a little rapper about to blow
but his album came, and it was not good
i think it went lead or double copper-wood
so these silly little fans, they were misled
by a nerdy internet computer hip-hop head
"me and you, clef, we're gonna make some cash."
"grab this silver paint and just paint my ass."
hey, mister, would you care to bear witness to
the ass-whippin' i'm about to administer
to this ass-kissin' little vaginal blister?
stanibus, little marshall mathers' sister
and in this corner, we have the "mr
not-havin'-it," it's the mad, sinister
dr. evil, with his bag of tricks for
this little antagonistic faggot
dick-sucking ex-ll cool j fan from windsor
i'm 'bout to murder little kenny-fag-kaniff-sta
you bastard, i ain't wanna have to diss ya
canibus, where the fuck you at? i miss ya!


canibitch, oh, canibitch
wherefore art thou, canibitch?
please tell me what happened with
that style that you were rappin' with
canibitch, oh, canibitch
are you from los angeles
new york, or just a janitor
from canada? oh, canibitch


now, at first, i ain't really understand this shit
picture me, for a second, and imagine it
chillin' in the bat mansion relaxin' when
all of a sudden some bullshit comes across the scanners, it's
canibitch, on some 'stan lives' shit
it creeped me out at first; man, this is sick
but me, bein' just as sick, this conflict
gets my dick harder than arithmetic
and i know how you jealous ones envy
i shoulda knew better from the first few letters you sent me
the first two letters, you were tellin' me shit like
you respect me, like any other regular mc
the third letter, you asked how come i ain't return
none of the messages at shady records you left me
the fourth letter: "slim, you're really startin' to upset me."
the fifth letter told me you were comin' to get me
the sixth letter, there's a bomb threat on our building
this crazy motherfucker's really tryna kill me
so i went back and read the first few letters that said
some shit about a message you left
oh shit! that's not a e, that's an a!
this dude wants to leave me a 'massage,' he's gay!
right away, i'm on the phone with dr. dre
"we got a bogey," "marshall, i'm on the way."


canibitch, oh, canibitch
wherefore art thou, canibitch?
please tell me what happened with
that style that you were rappin' with
canibitch, oh, canibitch
are you from los angeles
new york, or just a janitor
from canada? oh, canibitch


so, in two seconds flat, dre's at my crib
only thing is, we both know where this kid lives
and neither one of us have canadian citizenship
"shit. oh, dre, wait a minute, that's it!
all we gotta do is use a bit of turbo-boost
we can fly over the border!" "let's go!" 
canibitch, oh, canibitch
wherefore art thou, canibitch?
please tell me what happened with
that style that you were rappin' with
canibitch, oh, canibitch
are you from los angeles
new york, or just a janitor
from canada? oh, canibitch
