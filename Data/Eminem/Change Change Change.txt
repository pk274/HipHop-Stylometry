and i'm hurtin for you dog but ain't nobody pain is like yours
heaven's prays all i'm wanna do is my lord
i get down for real all i know is one way
but i overstand they truth is all lame
being down and out and i love you always
no more games i'mma change what you call rage
a scooby doo y'all scooby doo y'all!
we blowin smoke creatin scooby doo fogs
wack as a shooter so we called him tony kukoc
rep my crew yo flipmode hit you off
you on my nuts so you better hold tenderly
then send yo' ass back home without no energy
i been workin' got these grown men hurtin'
'cause truth is he's free-er than they gon' ever be
got the stove on my waist and we cooks
come on pana vinnie got a clip full
infrared with the clip full no leash on my pitbull
riding through the hood and feeling good
and somebody at the front door
backstage front row what i got to front for
on the streets or on tv it just don't pay the be a truth tellin' mc
a caught a feeling when you represented
and you don't get no play if you an emcee with a small name
i'm active no off days and i got boss paid with music i caught babes
but then i put it in the grave 'cause i'm steppin' off stage
alucard in the booth when i'm losing it on days
off ya tryna make me depart ya from my thought-a
started a missionary way on my life the mic i rust like bostage
the handle on the pistol is pearly like god's gate
and i'mma cut, i ain't gay–okay
seem like she don't really need no gas for the trip
but forget the click-clack ain't no need for the steel
the father bails out he ain't ready for a kid
because a stray bullet might be headed for the swings
praying that i fall for the mouse trap i doubt that
after platinum it's the same thing
same old same old but poppa's got a brand new bag
testicles store the piss and i just pissed on my shit
you know and i know we need to get right
i need your help and i'm not asking it nice
such signs of truth in his plain face she spied
a thug came to me said it changed his life
'cause if it was up to me i’d make a new blueprint
i'mma fuckin' cut my verse in half and splurg all over this new track
