i cut back on the syllables just a little
but still, i feel i should kill a few just to show that still i do
put forth an effort, one foot forward, thank heavens
and good lord, whoever would've thought that my umbili' cord
woulda been c-cut-cut from the s-s-same cloth?
there's no other name, just be thankful that i came forth
temper the same, whether it's boiled or flame broiled
you say my name, you bet that ass you gon' pay for it
just the respect, it's not the crown that i came for
but if you feel like passin' it around, well then, jay, throw it
'cause we all go straight toward it, if not, i just wait for it
the other skateboard, got a couple of scrapes forget about it
i'm stuck in this rut, but i'll get up out it
i always do, i ain't gon' sit here and argue about it
i can't hop out of that gutter, i just crawled through up out it
i'm back, i'm sorry, i feel awful about it
