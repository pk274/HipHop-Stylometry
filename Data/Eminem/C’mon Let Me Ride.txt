you want to ride my bicycle, you want to ride my bike
(ha-ha!)


she’s distracted, by my reflectors
man, i can tell this chick’s attracted
my wheels spoke to her, my schwinn is a chick magnet
bagging up chicks like a bag of chips
with a bag of prophylactics as big as mick jagger lips
shagging’s not something i'm a pro at, but i ain’t practicing shit
allen iverson of safe sex
condoms are for practice, man, i skip practice
flip backwards while i flip this bike on its banana seat
my fantasy is to have you land where the kickstand is
got this bitch gaggin’, they call me the broad killer
i’m the cousin of godzilla
‘cause i spit fire and my dick’s draggin', zig-zaggin' up the avenue
pullin’ these chicks in my antagonist wagon, screamin’


you want to ride my bicycle, you want to ride my bike
you want to ride my bicycle, you want to ride my bike, ha ha
