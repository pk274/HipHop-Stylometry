there's several different levels to devil worshippin': horse's heads
human sacrifices, canibalism, candles and exorcism
animals having sex with 'em, camels, mammals and rabbits
but i don't get into that, i kick the habit, i just
beat you to death with weapons that eat through the flesh
and i never eat you unless the fuckin', meat looks fresh
i got a lion in my pocket, i'm lyin'
i got a nine in my pocket, and baby i'm just
dyin' to cock him
he's ready for war
i'm ready for war
i got machetes and swords for any faggot that said he was raw
my uz is as
heavy as yours, yeah you met me before
i just didn't have as large an arsenal of weapons before
marshall will step in the door
i lay your head on the floor
with your body spread on the bedspread
red on the wall
red on the ceilin', red on the floor, get a new whore
met on the second, wed on the third, then she's dead on the fourth
i'm dead wrong

repeat chorus twice
