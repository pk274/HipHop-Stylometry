i make music to make you sick of fake music
hate music like devil-worshipping satan music
so say your prayers, your 'hail mary's and jesuses
take two sticks, tape 'em together and make a crucifix
try to stop it but you can't do it
a whole generation of kids blowing out their fucking brains to this
kurt cobain music. students converted to 'caine users
as soon as they heard it went out and murdered and maimed to it
what's your name?


it's devil's night, it's devil's night, it's devil night
cause i came back to rule this time (it's devil night)
cause i came back to take what's mine (it's devil's night)
it's devil's night, it's devil's night, it's devil night
cause i came back to rule this time (it's devil night)
