right now i'm on the edge, so don't push me
i aim straight for your head, so don't push me
fill your ass up with lead, so don't push me
i got something for your ass, keep thinking i'm pussy
right now i'm on the edge, so don't push me
i aim straight for your head, so don't push me
fill your ass up with lead, so don't push me
i got something for your ass, keep thinking i'm pussy (em, drop that shit, c'mon)


these are my ideas, this is my sweat and tears
this is shit that i saw with my eyeballs, my ears (what else?)
this is me, who's gotta be what you see on tv
what you hear on cd, what appears easy (what else?)
man these teenie boppers see me on these magazine covers
in these beanies and these rags living fantasies, frontin' (c'mon)
like it's all fun and games 'til they shoot 'em up bang
and you see your brains hang and you see we ain't playing
ain't saying we ain't laying down at night and ain't praying
i bullied my way in this game, man, i'm done playing
man, i'm done saying that i'm done playing
i'ma start laying into these motherfucking cocksuckers (c'mon)
there's no way i'ma back down like a goddamn coward, i can't
how would i look as a man bowing to his knees?
like the mad cow disease, let somebody lash out at me
and not lash back out at 'em, please
oh, woah, yo, ho
hold up, oh no, not me, not marshall
you wanna see marshall? i'll show you martial
i try to show you art, but you just pick it apart
so i see i have to start showing you fucking old farts
a whole 'nother side i wanted to not show you (c'mon)
so you know you're not dealing with some fucking marshmallow
little soft yellow, punk pussy, whose heart's jell-o 'cause
