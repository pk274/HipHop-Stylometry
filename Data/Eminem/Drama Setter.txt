i'm a drama setter
grippin' my berretta, sippin' amaretto
man, you crazy if you think i'ma let up
i told you i'm a drama setter
i'll be the first to set it, homie, you can bet it
just don't get in the way of my cheddar
man, ‘cause i'm a drama setter
i don't go lookin' for no trouble
but somehow the trouble always finds me
don't make me have you in the trauma center
with your momma cryin'
‘cause her only son is dyin'
she don't know it's just your karma catchin' up
‘cause i'm a drama setter
