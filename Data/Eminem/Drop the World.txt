so i could pick the world up and i'ma drop it on your fuckin' head
haha, yeah
bitch, i'ma pick the world up and i'ma drop it on your fuckin' head
yeah
and i could die now, rebirth, motherfucker
hop up in my spaceship and leave earth, motherfucker
i'm gone, motherfucker, i'm gone
i'm gone


it hurts, but i never show
this pain you'll never know
if only you could see just how lonely and how cold
and frostbit i've become
my back's against the wall
when push come to shove i just stand up and scream: "fuck 'em all!"


man, it feels like these walls are closin' in, this roof is cavin' in
oops, time to raise it then
your days are numbered like pages in
my book of rhymes; got 'em cookin', boy
this crooked mind of mine got 'em all shook
and scared to look in my eyes
i stole that fuckin' clock: i took the time
and i came up from behind and pretty much snuck up and butt-fucked this game up
better be careful when you bring my name up
fuck this fame, that ain't what
i came to claim, but the game ain't gonna be the same on the day that i leave it
but i swear, one way or another, i'ma make these fuckin' haters believe it
i swear to god, won't spare the rod
i'm a man of my word, so your fuckin' heads better nod
or i'ma fuck around in this bitch and roast everybody
sleep on me, that pillow is where your head'll lie
permanently, bitch, it's beddy-bye
this world is my easter egg, yeah, prepare to die!
my head is swole, my confidence is up, this stage is my pedestal
i'm unstoppable, incredible hulk
you're trapped in my medicine ball
i could run circles around you so fast your fuckin' head'll spin, dog
i'll split your cabbage and your lettuce and olives, i'll fuckin'â€”


pick the world up and i'ma drop it on your fuckin' head
yeah
bitch, i'ma pick the world up and i'ma drop it on your fuckin' head
yeah
and i could die now, rebirth, motherfucker
hop up in my spaceship and leave earth, motherfucker
i'm gone, motherfucker, i'm gone
i'm gone
