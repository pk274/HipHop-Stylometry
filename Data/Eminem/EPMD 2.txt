dun! i let it go for the family, meetin's at cote in miami
them wine bottles on maggie, extra large
sign up for my masterclass, escobar
feet up at mets stadium at my restaurant
tied in from az to dave east
you know my thoughts get crazy
my teachers, they couldn't grade me
i know some haitians in dade county, got choppers in haiti
she booked a flight to colombia, made her body amazin'
just to post it on tumblr, this that "fuck up the summer" shit
i don't care what you comin' with, me and hit-boy runnin' shit (runnin' shit)
big gold, rope chains, but they flooded now (yeah, flooded now)
pull up with the ghost like a haunted house (haunted house)
she gettin' scary, blood on my hands like carrie
might walk through a cemetery to see where hip-hop is buried
i said it was dead, but it faked its death like machiavelli
you see letters in red splatter, look like sauce and spaghetti
(yeah, ready?)


epmd, we're back in business (what?)
livin' in cramped conditions, will give you ammunition
i stock those shelves, i got those shells like taco bell and i'm not gon' fail
i got no l's (noels) like christmas, you don't wanna make the claws (claus) come out (nah)
y'all should call yourselves santa (why?) 'cause none of y'all are real (nah)
not a 'single one' (like what?), like a dollar bill (yeah)
just like your bitch in appellate court, she's on a pill (appeal)
we got her a 'bond' and she'll
never 'bail' on me (bail on me), not even outta jail (haha, jail)
epmd, but me, i gots no chill (ch-chill)
just a lotta skrill
lady, my paper's so crazy, i just tossed a mil' out the window of my mobile
on the fuckin' freeway on the way here (yeah)
like rudolph and his homies when they pullin' the sleigh, yeah
that's a lot of bucks flyin' when i'm makin' it rain, dear
green on me but no weed, shorty, just these, darling
a pocket full of pills, some are tylenol 3s, prolly two or three molly
so some are e  (summary), which reminds me of "rap summary," mami
my theme song, me and "p" always used to play that shit on repeat all day
so please call me "big daddy" (daddy)
plus i got the kane (cane) and "lean on me" (yeah)
mcs, i'm eatin' you b-i-t-c-h's like tortilla chips
me, i'm free of debt, yeah, green is on chia pet (woo)
this is the effects of my old neighborhood misery index
poverty at its peak, ocd and ptsd, i guess
r.i.p. out to dmx, stezo e and nipsey
ecstasy and prince markie dee, mf doom, i hit 50 via text
told him that i love him 'cause i don't even know when i'ma see him next (nah)
tomorrow could be your death (bring that beat back)
yeah, and this shit ain't for the faint
'cause the brain's illa trained killer, danger, deranged
and i drank all the dayquil (yeah) i blank on the paper
then wait 'til the page fill up (what?)
hate spiller, shameful the strength of a pain pill or tranq'
i just pray for the day when i'm able to say that i'm placed with the greats
and my name's with the kane's and the wayne's, and the jay's and the dre's
and the ye's, and the drake's and the j dilla's, jada's, cool j's
and the ra's and amazin' as nas is, and praise to the gods of this
shout to the golden age of hip-hop and the name of this song is
