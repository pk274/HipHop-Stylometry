it seems like no matter what i do, i just can't get away from them
get away from what?
the voices
i can hear 'em callin', callin', callin', callin', callin' me


i eat rappers, with the rhyme, consume 'em
the only fucking thing that you consume is time, i'm super human
my world is like a rubik's cube, it's too complex, girl, you assumin'
cupid's looming, my mentality's caveman, stupid woman
my life is truman show, all i have is music, ho
i stopped chasing every chick under the sun many moons ago, so pretend my dick is a balloon and blow
but you better put a fork in it if you think i’ma lay here just spooning, yo
oh, you think you the shit 'cause i just said you was beautiful?
diabolical to my last molecule, down to my last hair follicle and cuticle
rotten to the core to the bone cold all the way down to my soul from my head to my toe
ever since i was 13 i learned how to sew and sewed shut my own bootyhole
'cause i ain't took no shit since i looked down to my nuts and saw my first pubic grow
i told these stupid hoes when i come back i’ma set this bitch on fire!
and this time i don't mean i'ma pour gasoline on some chick and light her
'cause this time when i fuck this world i’ma put the whole goddamn dick inside her
i ain't even put my tip in that hole yet, i'ma go get nickel and try to rip it wider


shh!
did you hear that? somebody just said something
is anybody there?
i can hear 'em callin', callin', callin', callin', callin' me
