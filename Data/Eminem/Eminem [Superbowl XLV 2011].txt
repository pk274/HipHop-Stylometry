i get asked to do commercials all the time
and i always say the same thing
first, i need some hot chicks
second, we film at my house so i ain't gotta go anywhere
third, i record my own song


don't ****
bring it ****
cool refreshing ******* iced tea, drink it!


but once i try their products, i always hate 'em!
so i bounce...
damn! that is pretty good!
but i got one final demand
no, we can't change your name to eminem
shut up and drink the iced tea!
see? that's why i don't do commercials!
