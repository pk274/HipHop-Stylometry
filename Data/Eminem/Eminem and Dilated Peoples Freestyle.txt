peace to thirstin howl, a.l. and wordsworth
my mother smoked crack, i had a premature birth
i'm just a nerd cursed, with badly disturbed nerves
who wanna be the one to step up and get served first?
ninety-nine percent of aliens prefer earth
so i'm here to rule the planet, starting with your turf
i hid a secret message inside of a word search
with smeared letters, running together in blurred spurts
i hang with male chauvinist pigs and perverts
who point water pistols at women and squirt shirts
been a bad boy since diapers and gerber's
my first words were bleep-bleep and curse-curse
never had ish, and i still don't deserve dirt
my breath still stinks and i'm on my third certs
yanking out my stitches, hollering, "nurse! nurse!
you said this shot would numb it! trick, it just hurts worse!"
grew up in a dump next door to a burnt church
but gunshots drowned out crickets and bird chirps
and it's like that, and it's like that
