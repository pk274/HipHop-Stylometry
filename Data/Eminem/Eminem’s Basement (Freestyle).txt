yo, honestly i don't even know if i can come after that (yes he can)
ay-yo, in my mind i'm a fighter
my heart's a lighter
my soul is the fluid
my flow sparks it right up
but arsenic writer
author with arthritis, carpal tunnel
marshall will start shit-itis
hard-headed and hot-headed
bull-headed and pig-headed
dick-headed a prick, a big headache i'm sick
quick-witted for every lyric spitted
there are 6 critics who wait for me to slip wit' it
so quick, this dynamite stick, bury the wick
it's gonna explode any minute
some lunatic lit it
and it's not nelly
do not tell me to stop yelling
when i stop selling i quit so stop dwelling
i am not failing you fuckers are not ready
cause i got jelly, like beyonce's pot belly
this is destiny, yes, money
i'm off running so get off of me
i am not slowing or softening
no apologies
i make on this-
(put the mic down, the cords too hot)
