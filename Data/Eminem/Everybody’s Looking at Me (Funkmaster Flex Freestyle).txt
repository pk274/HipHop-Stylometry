lights, action, cameras flashin'
managers, sponsors, concerts, monster mashin'
flashin'
type who might throw his underwear in the trash like marilyn manson
updated axle rose
white version of shaft, pimp slappin' hoes
pull up like a mac, jet black limo
stretch so far back, can't see the back windows
steppin' out, pink hats, furs and minks
chick on each arm, what the **** you think?
right arm got that kid from *nsync's chick on it
left arm got that little p!nk chick on it
me and dre at the vma's again
pissin' off all these lesbians and gays again


my head hits the pillow, a weepin' willow
i can't sleep, a pain so deep, it bellows
but these cellos help just to keep me mellow
hands on my head, touch knees to elbows
i'm hunched over, emotion just flows over
these cold shoulders are both frozen, you don't know me
i keep sayin' it, i can't stress it enough
so keep playin' it, and stand next to the subs
i choke mics like asphyxiation
when i'm stranglin' my own throat masturbatin'
shit yeah, i'm a basket case
and i mastered this rap s*** 'til my ass gets wasted
'til my assassination
'til i'm slain 'cause of some **** infatuation
.44 mag's a fascination
a taste for disaster, and if that's the case, thenâ€”
