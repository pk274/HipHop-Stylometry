yo i'm two-faced, and bugged the fuck out like mr. furley
so when i swing a fist of fury y'all can kiss the jewelry
scrap, back the fuck up, we missed the brewery
hurry, i'm tryin to pick up cage's sister early
me and greed smoke weed and od
we're so keyed there's no need to stop the nosebleed
i need a casket, i killed some conceited bastard
and beat his ass with a bat wrapped in a sheet of acid
i'm pre-disaster, i fuck shit up before it happens
like blown engines of airplanes with snorin' captains
your style's monotonous, like a borin' job gets
i come to the battle and beat you with foreign objects
i'm dumber than oklahoma ignorin' bomb threats
i'm dumber than trying to start a war with 'nam vets
my metaphors are like a set of jaws
i get applause, cause people would rather hear mine instead of yours
still on the run from stabbing a bitch in the side
so i'm hitchin' this ride with the motherfuckin' indigenous tribe
