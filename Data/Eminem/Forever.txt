there they go, packin' stadiums as shady spits his flow
nuts they go, macadamian, they go so ballistic, whoa
he can make them look like bozos
he's wonderin' if he should spit this slow, fuck no
go for broke, his cup just runneth over, oh no
he ain't had him a buzz like this
since the last time that he overdosed
they been waitin' patiently for pinocchio to poke his nose
back into the game and they know
rap will never be the same as befo'
bashin' in the brains of these hoes
and establishin' a name as he goes
the passion in the flame is ignited
you can't put it out once we light it
this shit is exactly what the fuck
that i'm talkin' about when we riot
you dealin' with a few true villains
who stand inside of a booth, truth-spillin'
and spit true feelings until our tooth fillings
come flyin' up out of our mouths, now, rewind it
payback, motherfucker
for the way that you doubted me, how's it taste?
when i slap the taste outta your mouth
with the bass so loud that it shakes the place
i'm hannibal lecter, so just in case you're thinkin' of savin' face
you ain't gonna have no face to save
by the time i'm through with this place, so drake
