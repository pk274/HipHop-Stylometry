i done figured this rap shit out
i map shit out strategically
timing is everything and that seems to be the key
to my success, it's worked for me repeatedly
let 'em diss you first, and respond immediately
in order to master the art of war, don't start a war
shit, not no more, we done scared 'em off, there are no more
victims to sic, i'm fixin' to pick some and start shit
ain't got no pictures to rip and shit to throw darts at
ain't got no more targets, shit, irv and jeff
we done beat 'em to death, benzino in debt
there seems to just be no one left to bully, bush is pussy
why the fuck you think his name's bush? puss is bushy
ain't shit goin' on, shit, i been gettin' so bored lately
i'm thinkin of doin' some shit
to get you to go and hate me again
to tell the truth, i liked the shit better then
shit, i could spit better, i'm 'bout to kick this sick shit again
look, the game just ain't the same, it's changin'
shit, dre's quittin', jay's quittin'
now it's just wangstas just sayin' the same shit
it's fake and it's ancient
it's makin' me so bored, i'ma just make a new language
fubba you cubba kubba, yubba yub yubba yooba
yooba can subbabick my dubbibbabick through a tooba
summaladoomalama
i'm not a human, i'm a suicider supersonic suicidal unabomber
you think i'm the new osama
press thinks i'm the new madonna
jeffery dahmer left me with his legacy to carry on
a lot of talk and rumors honest
"who's the hottest?" â€“ to be honest
hip-hop ain't been the same since 2pac moved to cuba on us
