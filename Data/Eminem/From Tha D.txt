ooh wow, look at these bitches up in this club
man i'm getting me some digits 'fore i leave up out this club and it's like
ooh pow wham bam thank you ma'am i ain't kissing you on them lips
but i'd be glad to shake your hand and let's get blew out
let's start some shit tonight just let me pick a chick then i'ma leave me with tonight then we get to fightin' then
ooh wow this music makes me rowdy
how they gonna play that new trick trick and expect no one it's like
ooh wow and one more shot of hpnotiq
and i'm out of control
my body i go robotic and blow a fusе out
homies is like you startin' to stagger and i'm likе nah that's just my swagger
and i'm dancing with this cute black girl and i'm
loose now, i don't want to fight i feel like partyin'
go until the cd tips my bicardi and bicardi is making me loose my
snooze now and never fails i know i'm going to jail
i might as well take the laces out of my shoes now
