makaveli rest in peace
irv gotti, too much bacardi in his body
mouth like a 12-gauge shotty  (feel me!) (come get me)
and ja said he shall be (motherfuckers if you want shady)
the lost forgotten seed of 2pac (if pac was still here now)
to lead this industry into the ways of the man (he would never ride with ja)
follow me! (na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na)
keep my mesh vest as pac's vest


come get me
if you muthafuckas want shady
if pac was still here now
he would never ride with ja
nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah

you ain't no killa, you a pussy
that ecstasy done got you all emotional and mushy
bitches wearin' rags in photos, ja's words bein' quoted
in the source, stealin' pac's shit like he just wrote it
you loud mouths pray to god, hopin' no one's listenin'
see 50 comin' for me, oh my god, maâ€”my position
no one'll pay attention to me
please gotti, here i go, give me this pill
ecstasy done got me feelin' so invincible
and now all of a sudden i'm a fuckin' madman who screams
like i'm pac, but i'm not, enemies, hennessey
actin' like i'm great, but i'm fake, i'm crazy
sweat drip, get me off this trip, someone stop this train
some say my brain is all corrupted, fucked from this shit
i'm stuck, i'm addicted to these drugs, i'ma quit
sayin' muthafuckas names before somebody fucks me up
ain't no pussies over here, partner, see you in hell, fucka


come get me
motherfucker if you want shady
if pac was still here now
he would never ride with ja,
nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah


get off that e
'fore you try to come and fuck with me
it's aftermath here now
shady records got it locked
la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-locked
