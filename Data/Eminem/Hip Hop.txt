man, i thought this was supposed to be hip hop, hip hop
i'd rather be fishing in flip flops, flip flops
or cross over to country like kid rock, did, i
can't see no country singers beefing over some guitar
riff that willie nelson lifted from bob seger
when i was younger i was so eager
to have a gun i would do the same
couldn't wait to get to the shooting range
me and my man goofy gary just trying to let loose some steam
motherfuckers laughing 'cause i couldn't aim
so i'd pull the fucking target closer and just shoot the thang
i used to have this theory: keep three bullets in the gun
it was a mandatory year up here in michigan
for each bullet if you got no ccw license
i tried to apply for one, they said it'd take five-six months
what the fuck am i supposed to do mean time when rivals come?
hide that sumbitch in the glovebox or inside the trunk
now, back to what my three-bullet theory was
i'm triple platinum, i ain't trying to catch no murder one
figured i'd shoot to wound, probably miss with at least one
but them other two gon' fuck his shoulder and his kneecap up
then i'mma say it's self defense," how come i had the gun?"
"was because i was at the range, on my way back from"
this dude approached me on some bullshit
i'd get a year for each bullet at the most
as opposed to having a full clip in that
that was my idiotic logic, it was basically for safety
but it gave me power, and it made me crazy
and psychotic, i just got retarded once i got it
thank god it was empty the night that i got caught with it
what the fuck, man i thought that it was supposed to be
