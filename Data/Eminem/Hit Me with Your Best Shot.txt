hit me with your best shot! hit me with your best shot!
hit me with your best shot!
hit me with your best shot! hit me with your best shot!
hit me with your best shot! put me through my place!
c'mon! put me through my place!
c'mon! put me through my place!
c'mon! put me through my place!
c'mon! put me through my place! (a'ight, here's where i come in at)


i came in this game with bad intentions
and i ain't budged, not even an inch since then
i'm stubborn, evil, and insensitive
i'm like nothing you ever seen, pencil in
hand, it's like i'm holding the insulin
so you might wanna button it like benjamin
i ain't frightened of nothing, i injure men
step right in this mark with my henchmen and
walk, straight to the stage
i ain't here to cause trouble, get the fuck out my face
fall back, little cocksucker
i ain't a&w, don't get your cold mugs in my way
get 'em? shattered, fucking a
been this way since b.c., what can i say?
i'm stuck in my ways like double stick tape
don't get turned to a vegetable, dick face!
you ain't superman, stay in your lane, lois
d12 spitting flames like flamethrowers
spit till we get sprained jaws with metaphors
that cut with the same force as chainsaws
hope you're coming with your a game
'cause things have changed and this game isn't the same game, boys
the stakes have been raised, better make lemonade
when they give you lemons, if they want us, let 'em aim for us
