so i changed, huh?
you got a phone
pick it up, call me


how come we don't even talk no more?
and you don't even call no more?
we don't barely keep in touch at all
and i don't even feel the same love when we hug no more
and i heard it through the grapevine, we even beefing now
after all the years we've been down
ain't no way, no how, this bullshit can't be true
we family, ain't a damn thing changed, unless it's you


we were so young, so full of life and vibrance
side by side, wherever you was riding, i went
so close, almost on some bonnie and clyde shit
when ronnie died, you was right by my side
with a shoulder to cry on and tissue to wipe my eyes
and a bucket to catch every tear i cried inside it
you even had the same type of childhood i did
sometimes i just wanna know why is it
that you succame to yours and mine, i survived it
you ran the streets, i nine-to-fived it
we grew up, grew apart as time went by us
then i blew up, to both yours and mines surprises
now i feel a vibe, i just can't describe it
much as your pride tries to hide it
you're cold, your touch is just like ice
and your eyes is a look of resentment
i can sense it and i don't like it


how come we don't even talk no more?
and you don't even call no more?
we don't barely keep in touch at all
and i don't even feel the same love when we hug no more
and i heard it through the grapevine, we even beefing now
after all the years we've been down
ain't no way, no how, this bullshit can't be true
we family, ain't a damn thing changed, unless it's you


how come we don't even talk no more?
and you don't even call no more?
we don't barely keep in touch at all
and i don't even feel the same love when we hug no more
and i heard it through the grapevine, we even beefing now
after all the years we've been down
ain't no way, no how, this bullshit can't be true
we family, ain't a damn thing changed, unless it's you


it gets lonely at the top 'cause my homie had to stop
now we acting like i gotta live only for the block
and homies in the hood only see me on the tube
so they gossip on the porch, get to speaking all rude
fools i used to rap with all expect magic
like my finger get to snapping and poof, it just happen
but proof is just acting out the part he was thrown
shady made it so my babies ain't starving at home
see the devil in your glance, since the ghetto, we been friends
forever real intelligence, that's forever 'til the end
i peep the hatreds in your eyes and the satan in your lies
ain't wasting my time with these snakes in disguise
how come when you talk, it's with bitter and spite?
and how come it was my fault for what you did with your life?
and every time i go to hear you and play, you look away
we barely embrace, you can't even look me in my face


how come we don't even talk no more?
and you don't even call no more?
we don't barely keep in touch at all
and i don't even feel the same love when we hug no more
and i heard it through the grapevine, we even beefing now
after all the years we've been down
ain't no way, no how, this bullshit can't be true
we family, ain't a damn thing changed, unless it's you (you, you, you, you...)
