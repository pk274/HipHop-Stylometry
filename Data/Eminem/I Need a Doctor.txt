i told the world, one day i would pay it back
say it on tape, and lay it, record it
so that one day i could play it back
but i don't even know if i believe it when i'm sayin' that
doubts startin' to creep in, every day, it's just so gray and black
hope, i just need a ray of that, 'cause no one sees my vision
when i play it for 'em, they just say it's wack
but they don't know what dope is
and i don't know if i was awake or asleep when i wrote this
all i know is, you came to me when i was at my lowest
you picked me up, breathed new life in me, i owe my life to you
but for the life of me, i don't see why you don't see like i do
but it just dawned on me you lost a son
demons fightin' you, it's dark
let me turn on the lights and brighten me and enlighten you
i don't think you realize what you mean to me
not the slightest clue
'cause me and you were like a crew, i was like your sidekick
you gon' either wanna fight when i get off this fuckin' mic
or you gon' hug me, but i'm outta options
there's nothin' else i can do 'cause—


it hurts when i see you struggle, you come to me with ideas
you say they're just pieces, so i'm puzzled
'cause the shit i hear is crazy
but you're either gettin' lazy or you don't believe in you no more
seems like your own opinions, not one you can form
can't make a decision, you keep questionin' yourself
second guessin' and it's almost like you're beggin' for my help
like i'm your leader, you're supposed to fuckin' be my mentor
i can endure no more, i demand you remember who you are
it was you who believed in me when everyone was tellin' you
don't sign me, everyone at the fuckin' label, let's tell the truth
you risked your career for me, i know it as well as you
nobody wanted to fuck with the white boy
dre, i'm cryin' in this booth
you saved my life, now maybe it's my turn to save yours
but i can never repay you, what you did for me is way more
but i ain't givin' up faith, and you ain't givin' up on me
get up, dre, i'm dyin', i need you
come back, for fuck's sake, 'cause—
