kay slay! (yeah) yo..
drama king! (yeah!)
check it out, check it out, o. trice!
(shady records nigga, it's going down once again, boy)
it's just a scratch, man (let's go, em)


i murder this ink as soon as i touch the page
you ain't gon' have no other choice but to rush the stage
and charge the mic, and i hope you got the heart to fight
cause you gon' have to, cause you ain't got the smarts to write
something that good, to try to come back at me with
what you gon' do, try to out-rap me with that happy shit?
you motherfuckers crack me up, talking bout you gonna smack me up
yall won't even back me up
throw up your paws, you pussies can't even scratch me hard
it's like fucking cats de-clawed trying to jack me off
you think i'm afraid? what you trying to throw some fear in me?
you think i'm dumb enough to roll with no security?
i'm doing my best to try to show maturity
but don't sit there and stare at me like hoes and sneer at me
like it's supposed to be scaring me
like i won't leap clean over this fucking
v.i.p. rope and throw this chair
at anyone close or near me, trying to approach me physically
cause he don't spit lyrically
and he knows that my flow's so sick, his ho's on my dick
and he's so sick of hearing me, my posters are staring at him
but i don't think he knows the severity
of what it could escalate to or that it could grow so seriously
if i go hysterically, cause i guarantee
there's no one in here that would resort back to childhood
any quicker than i would, or hit you with plywood
especially when i'm sipping on this liquor and tonic
one swig of this bottle i'mma go upside your head so hard with it
the mark from it'll be so dark that it'll leave a scar so big
you'll be able to read a label from the motherfucking
sticker that's on it, i'm sick of the nonsense
shit is ridiculous and i refuse to let it get to this point
where i'mma let you sit on my conscience, i'm gone, bitch (yeah!)
