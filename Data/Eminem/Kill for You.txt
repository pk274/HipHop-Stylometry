in your dream, you're drownin', i just waltz in and saved you
i'm your alternate escape route, the altar you pray to
your ultimate savior, your behavior is altered
ain't your fault 'cause i made you
brainwash and persuade you
gibraltar, your faith'll never falter or waver
one you call to in danger, i'm your guardian angel
nobody can tell you shit, you've already made your
mind just follow me, babe, you
won't be sorry you stayed, you
always ride, whatever the plan is
'til the end, even if i led us into an ambush
even if we robbed a first national and cops caught us redhanded
they're coming at us, and we're trapped with our backs up
against the wall, and it's too tall
you'd catapult me or hold the ladder for me
stay back to get captured, take the fall
you make it all worth it
baby doll, you're perfect the way you are
accidents happen
all i know is you love me, that's really all that matters
and any who cross our paths are just collateral damage
at your side, got your lateral, back, your front, diagonal
backwards, blackbirds, we attack like animals
when they threaten what we have it's a natural reaction
you'll lay a bitch flat on her back in a second flat for me
who tries to take your man from you
it's blasphemy, another casualty, you'll go whatever route
do whatever you have to do, you'd blast for me
i never doubt that
that's 'cause you
