even birds of our combines float if you let them
grippin' the mic and rippin' it right you listen you like
to speak the language of a servile breath
thinkin of a way where i can better myself
a bottle of juice is no excuse the truth hurts
mad at the world every verse i gotta body shit
i tell the whole story nothin' but truth
they seen the navy blue choking on things of two
'cause you're alright with him 'cause he loves you
and it ain't no clause that say fraud ain't no tall tales
shooters on deck i break bread and they owe me
see through the truth and them lies homie
shine decoded the vote and flow and showing signs i wrote it
quit giving me my ammo can't you see why i'm so mean?
