hey lady, hey darling, hey baby, i'm sorry
(i don't think you really wanna be my girl)
but i can't be, your boyfriend if you toy with my mothafuckin' emotions
(fucking with me could be dangerous)
i'll kill you, bitch i'm fucking for real, i'll make you suffer
(you never know what i may really be like in real life)
like i suffered, if you fuck me, don't make me fall in love
(i'm the type, that might flip and get a little bit crazy)


i'm internationally known baby but actually
there are few people who know how i am naturally
all you know is that i can act irrationally
when you shove a puppet up in my face on national tv
so they label me this crazed loony rap bully
but truthfully that ain't the truth and if you believe
in that shit then you'll believe anything's true
and you're too stupid to ever get to know me personally
but personally that actually works for me
cause the last thing that i need's a string attached to me
i'm a bachelor, bitch, and i ain't in no fast fury
to run out and find a new mrs. mathers
cause see, technically me and kim ain't back fully
but we do still make booty calls occasionally
but be damned if i end up back in that pattern
and we end up back at that god damn tavern
and having another déjà vu, we seeing security
pass my pussy around like it's ja rule's jewelry
i got news for you bitch, your new curfew's early
you ain't home by 2:30, 
hey lady, hey darling, hey baby, i'm sorry
(i don't think you really wanna be my girl)
but i can't be, your boyfriend if you toy with my mothafuckin' emotions
(fucking with me could be dangerous)
i'll kill you, bitch i'm fucking for real, i'll make you suffer

see what we do under the covers
should stay between the covers
and the two of us and we ain't gotta be news coverage
on the front page cover of us as new lovers
but this is when a bitch get to showing her true colors
cause the truth of it, everything that i do's public
and you'd love it if you could run and tell all your friends
guess who you just screwed
as soon as me and you've done it
and save the used rubber to show 'em the proof of it
i guess it's do unto others as you'd have 'em do unto you
but you better be careful of who you're doing it to
cause you never know when the shoe could end up
on the other foot and it backfires on you
cause you may think you want it
then you want me, til you get me
then you got me and you're fucked
'cause you'll be stuck with me
for the rest of your life cause if i get attached to you
we'll be joined at the hip, i'll be so latched to you
you'll be walking out the house and i'll run up and tackle you
chain your ass up to the bed and shackle you
you don't think you're leaving this house in that, do you?
not 'til i brand my name in your ass and tattoo you
and have you walking out this bitch in turtleneck sweaters
scarves and full leathers in 90 degree weather
front on me? never cause we gon' be together forever
right, bitch? right, bitch?
