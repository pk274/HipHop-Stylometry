i make it look easy
like i made it overnight
i make it look easy
but you don't see the dark side
and all of the monsters i had to fight (fight)
and all of the nightmares (nightmares)
made me stronger than life (yeah)


y'all say i've changed
really though? how so?
got all this bread
i'm still sourdough (sour tho')
i don't know, square peg, round hole
like a block of cheese in a paper towel roll
rocky balboa, never been no towel thrower
even when i got kicked to the curb
life knocked my dick in the dirt
i got back up, flipped it the bird
'til i earned the attention i yearned
not to mention, i learned
how to turn resentment and hurt to an unquenchable thirst
in the simplest terms, it's revenge of the nerd
in every sense of the word
but all you see is the fame and the millions
you don't see the strength, the resilience
how i rack my brain, but it feels as if
i'm tryin' to explain it to children
so a lot of this pain isn't healin'
no escapin' it, this anger is spillin'
almost like recreatin' the feelin'
of 9/11 when the second plane hit the buildin'
so let 'em paint me the villain
some of this just may be a symptom
of havin' way too much income
but when you struggled every day just to get some
now all of this hate is a syndrome
when they can't relate and that stems from
money lookin' like it grows on trees
yeah, they're green, but those aren't leaves
sufficed to say, with every sacrifice i made
it's like i gave up my life to fame
all the nights that i lied awake
nights i stayed up to write and prayed
had to claw, scratch, and fight my way
just follow me and i'll light the way
look to the hook if your sky look grey
and rappers, how can we be
on the same level now when i gotta look down and see these
clowns that are on the ground?
bitch, i got clouds beneath me
ever since i put out the ep to the height of 2003-me
you ain't see the struggle to make it out the d.
because i made it somehow look easy
