step by step, heart to heart
left, right, left, we all fall down


step by step, heart to heart
left, right, left, we all fall down
like toy soldiers
bit by bit, torn apart
we never win, but the battle wages on
for toy soldiers


step by step, heart to heart
left, right, left, we all fall down
like toy soldiers
bit by bit, torn apart
we never win, but the battle wages on
for toy soldiers


step by step, heart to heart
left, right, left, we all fall down
like toy soldiers
bit by bit, torn apart
we never win, but the battle wages on
for toy soldiers
