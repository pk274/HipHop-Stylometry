i'm sittin' here reminiscin'
think i just got a light bulb
somethin' i'd like to mention, this is just on a side note
word to the terror squad, joe, this is all puns aside though
i know me and mariah didn't end on a high note
but that other dude's whipped, that pussy got him neutered
tried to tell him this chick's a nutjob 'fore he got his jewels clipped
almost got my caboose kicked
fool, quit, you not gon' do shit
i let her chop my balls off too 'fore i lost to you, nick
i should quit watchin' news clips, yeah
my balls are too big, i should be talkin' pool 'cause i got scratch
so my pockets full when i'm takin' shots at you
fuck it, lemme chalk the cue stick
i'm over the top, like cool whip
and i promise you the day i fall off or lose it
i will stop and cut off the music
opportunist, wanna kill shit every chance that i got to do this
stackin' my guap, savage, i'm not to fool with
like a handgun, you could say i'm like a gat when it's cocked
i keep it a (buck, buck), your ass'll get shot
if rap was an actual glock
you'd act like you strapped when you're not
only cap that you pop is the top on the can of your pop
you the man 'til i pop your top
you ain't jack in a box and i ain't talkin' a hamburger spot
cracker with the barrel, armed to the teeth, anderson .paak (yeah)
rest in peace to afeni and her son pac
you sent me that plaque with his rhyme sheet, i haven't forgot (nah)
blow 30 million in a month, call it brewster's millions
just hope i don't lose the feelin', from soldier to civilian
got everything i need
but i don't even see myself in the future chillin'
only thing i don't have in the booth's a ceiling
just call me the roofless villain
they tellin' me sky's the limit, so i got my head in the clouds
unicorn in human form, saw a gift horse
looked him dead in the mouth
and lord, good lookin' out
for sendin' me edna and charles
whenever mom kicked me out of the house
they were the bomb, then you sent me ll
all the times that i hated myself, since eleven or twelve
only way that i knew how to better myself
is when i'm bet against by everyone else
so, joe hit the head on the nail
you ain't seen god 'til you starin' down a barrel
i was gun-shy, but now like a snail
the slug's comin' out of its shell
