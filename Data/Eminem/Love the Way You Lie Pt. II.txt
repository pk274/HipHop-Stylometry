it's morning, you wake, a sunray hits your face
smeared makeup as we lay in the wake of destruction (shh)
hush baby, speak softly, tell me you're awfully sorry
that you pushed me into the coffee table last night so i can push you off me
try and touch me so i can scream at you not to touch me
run out the room and i'll follow you like a lost puppy
baby, without you, i'm nothing, i'm so lost, hug me
then tell me how ugly i am, but that you'll always love me
then after that, shove me, in the aftermath of the
destructive path that we're on, two psychopaths, but we
know that no matter how many knives we put in each other's backs
that we'll have each other's backs 'cause we're that lucky
together, we move mountains, let's not make mountains out of molehills
you hit me twice, yeah, but who's counting?
i may have hit you three times, i'm starting to lose count
but together, we'll live forever, we found the youth fountain
our love is crazy, we're nuts, but i refused counseling
this house is too huge, if you move out, i'll burn all two thousand
square feet of it to the ground, ain't shit you can do about it
'cause with you, i'm in my fucking mind, without you, i'm out it
