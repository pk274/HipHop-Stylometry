me and pace had to flee in haste from bein' chased
for some e & js we boosted out of some korean place
i get drunk and hang-glide off of st. ides'
and spray-paint the blank sides of all the subway train rides
i got a pitbull that eats sheep and spits wool
and chews on human body tissue 'til its stomach gets full
skip school, barely went to class, thinkin' shit's cool
hid a loaded pistol under this retarded kid's stool
i had a dream i blew up with half a mil' sold
and still stole a credit card, a purse, and someone's billfold
i'm from a city where the weather's always real cold
and chill mode can turn into somebody gettin' steel-toed
we be hangin' on the block 'til dawn
stayin' spaced out like dr. octagon
feelin' for the beats like they chaka khan


mama-se, mama-sa, mama-macosa
pace won, slang ton, and yah
young zee, az-izz, d.u., and moi
bizarre kid, loon one and rah
mama-se, mama-sa, mama-macosa
