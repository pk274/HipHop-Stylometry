she invites me to the condo
uh-oh, wifey's in chicago (oh, oh)
my side piece, but she's also
someone's wife, so time we spend is borrowed
but it's our moment right here, fuck tomorrow
'cause moments like these are to die for
and she's clear, all nice and easy
as hair when i'm bleaching it blonde
so we got that lightning in a bottle (oh)

she's tipsy, i'm sober
so she gets a chip on her shoulder
sits on the sofa, i go to load a
slick rick song or throw some souls of mischief on
she goes, "all that old school hip-hop is over
think that shit's got pneumonia"
i told her, "bitch, now, just hold up!"
that's why rap needs a doctor
our genre's lymph nodes are swole up
it's time to check it for strep or some tonsillitis
'cause like what they swab you with when your throat hurts
that's why tribe is so vital: we need q-tip for the culture
(speed it up a little bit)
you ain't dealin' with a fuckin' featherweight
i used to medicate until i'd get a fuckin' bellyache
and now i'm finna step on the pedal, don't wanna ever brake
i want to accelerate to a level that i can elevate
demented with the pen, i'll make the mothafucker detonate
i wanna make it acapellaâ€”wait, i gotta set a date
with the devil and celebrate, together we can renovate
and re-develop, hell awaits, and i'ma get a special place
now, take a ride with me, hop into my time machine
i'ma take the driver's seat as i thrust into hyperspeed
like i'm a meteorite, and mothafuck the fucking media
right in the behind; i'm a human encyclopedia
i must be like pie crust because i was bred to rise like i was yeast
and you're never gonna reach these heights
they're just too high to reach it
i ain't even reached my fuckin' highest
you better pick another game, try hide-and-seek
and you might wanna decide to cheat
'cause you gotta open your eyes to peek
am i indeed the last of a dying breed?
even if you fire-breathe, ain't shit you can say to inspire heat
if you wrapped your entire mead pad up in a dryer sheet
and i'm back to rule the kingdom of fuck it
better not use me as your topic
anybody who brings me up, duck it
let me keep it 100
two things shouldn't be your themes of discussion
the queen and her husband
last thing you're gonna wanna be is our subjects, yeah
