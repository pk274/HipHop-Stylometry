i know this crack fiend maxine who needs a vaccine
she tests positive but tells you that her act's clean
plus she got a sugar daddy
gassin' every hooker that he takes in to crook her badly
if you mistook her, sadly, on her reputation
you're in jeopardation, if you ain't got no preparation
when you stepped away, son, she got her face done
lookin' provocative, she'll let you knock it if
you press the issue, and get undressed to kiss you
if you match the price, otherwise she won't look at you twice
but when you catch the lice, or get the urgency
to go to the emergency 'cause it burns to pee
don't bring your germs to me, 'cause i ain't tryna hear it
while you're fightin' your fuckin' disease tryna clear it
