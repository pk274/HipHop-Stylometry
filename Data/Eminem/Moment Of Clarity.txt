music business hate me ‘cause the industry ain't make me
hustlers and boosters embrace me and the music i be making
i dumb down for my audience and double my dollars
they criticize me for it, yet they all yell "holla"
if skills sold, truth be told, i'd probably be lyrically talib kweli
truthfully i wanna rhyme like common sense
but i did 5 mill' – i ain't been rhyming like common since (woo!)
when your cents got that much in common
and you been hustling since your inception
fuck perception! go with what makes sense
since i know what i'm up against
we as rappers must decide what's most important
and i can't help the poor if i'm one of them
so i got rich and gave back, to me that's the win-win
so next time you see the homie and his rims spin
just know my mind is working just like them (rims, that is)
