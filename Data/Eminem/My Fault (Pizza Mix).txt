i went to john's rave with ron and dave
and met a new wave blonde babe with half of her head shaved
a nurse aid who came to get laid and *tied* up
with first aid tape and *raped* on the first date
susan -- an ex-manic depressive who just moved from houston
who loves blues and alternative music (whattup?)
told me she was starvin, i said it wasn't a problem (nah!)
i got a coupon for this pizza with everything on it
we can double the mushrooms and minus the sausage

and now it's my fault, my fault (i'm sorry)
