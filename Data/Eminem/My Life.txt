while you were sippin' your own kool-aid gettin' your buzz heavy
i was in the fuckin' shed, sharpenin' my machete
sippin' on some of that revenge juice, gettin' my taste buds ready
to wolf down this spaghetti or should i say this spa-get-even?
i think you fuckin' meatballs keep on just forgettin'
thought he was finished, motherfucker, it's only the beginnin'
he's buggin' again, he's straight thuggin', fuck who he's offendin'! (yeah!)
he'll rip your vocal chords out and have them bitches plugged in the
motherfuckin' wall with 3000 volts of electricity
now take the other end of 'em, then plug them motherfuckers-in-each
one of your eye sockets 'cause i thought you might finally fuckin' see
that'll teach you to go voicin' your cocksuckin' opinion to me
i done put my blood, my sweat and my tears in this shit, fuck lettin'
up! you’re gonna end up regrettin' you ever betted against me
feels like i'ma snap any minute
yeah, it's happenin' again
and i'm thinkin' about just sayin', "motherfuck everybody that's up in this bitch but 50!"
‘cause this is all i know
this is why so hard i go
i swear to god i put my heart and soul
in this more than anybody knows
i'm trapped, so all i do is rap
but every time i rap i'm more trapped
and i rap myself right to this bubble
oh i guess it's bubble wrap (haha)
it's like a vicious cycle, my life's in a crisis
christ, how was i supposed to know shit would turn up like it did?
feels like i'm goin' psycho again (ch, ch, ch, ch)
and i might just blow my lid
shit, i almost wish that i would have never made recovery, kid
‘cause i'm runnin' in circles with—
