this ain't beef man
i don't know what the fuck to call it
but no beef
what up, x?
just hit 'em


i float like big's spirit in this bitch, i'm ghostly
rush me, 'cause you ain't gonna live to roast me
i'll have my motherfuckin' ass kick by moby
if i let some bitch in a can like 'bis cop over me
to do war and try to bring my crew back down
i'll never stoop to that level to do that now
i got a new cat, this time i'm pulling two gats out
with bullets (*bang*) i finally got something to shoot at now


i never really smashed on jermaine's ass, dre smashed him
nobody ganged up 'til he came back and jacked him
i never really brought it to his ass, i tapped him
i could have been like treach, poom-papped and slapped him
purple, for mimicking him with two rapping urkels
i could have snapped, took it past rap and hurt you
but i didn't, i kept it on wax and served you
i square dance 'cause i'm sick of rapping circles
around these clowns, steady trying to call me out
it's like i'm listening to motherfucking dogs meow
you'd probably do better trying to come and stomp me out
you don't want it with rap, this is what i'm all about (c'mon!)
(i) real gangsta, you ain't neither
(will) but i know that i spit ether
(not) i shit across your belly
(lose) show you i'm not r. kelly
(x!) pass me the weed
i'ma put my ashes out on his ass for the last time, man:
watch your fucking mouth


it's the last time, man
i'm through
