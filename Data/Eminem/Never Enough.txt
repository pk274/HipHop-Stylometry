there's not much you could do or say to phase me
people think i'm a little bit crazy
i get it from all angles, even occasionally doc dre-zie
will have to step in every once in a while to save me
to make me stop and think about it 'fore i just say things
sometimes i forget what other people just may think
a lot of rappers probably wouldn't know how to take me
if they heard some shit, i'd lay the tape 'fore they erased me
i may be a little too fast-paced and racy
sometimes the average listener rewinds and plays me
twenty times 'cause i say so many rhymes it may seem
like i'm goin' too fast 'cause my mind is racing
and i could give a fuck what category you place me
long as when i'm pushing up daisies
and gone as long as you place me amongst one of them greats
when i hit the heavenly gates i'll be cool beside jay-z
for every single die-hard fan who embraced me
i'm thankful for the talent in which god gave me
and i'm thankful for the environment that he placed me
believe it or not, i thank my mom for how she raised me
in the neighborhood daily that jumped and chased me
it only made me what i am today, see
regardless of what anybody believes who hates me
you ain't gonna make or break me
tryna strip me of my credibility and make me look fake, g
you're only gonna be in for a rude awakening
'cause sooner or later you haters are all gonna face me
and when you face me with all the shit you've been saving
to say to me, you had all this time to think about it
now don't pussy out and try to about face me
'cause i've been patiently waiting for the day
that we finally meet in the same place to see,
