if she was flavor, i won't save her
no taste buds, ho, later!
fuck you lookin' at, hater?
i saw them eyes like an ass raper
try to copy my swag like a cheating classmate
i'll be the last face you see 'fore you pass
when you get your fuckin' ass graded like a math paper
so ahead of my time, "late" means i'm early
my age is reversing, i'm basically thirty
amazingly sturdy, zany and wordy
brainy and nerdy, blatantly dirty
insanely perverted, rapey and scurvy
they blame me for murdering jamie lee curtis
said i put her face in the furnace, beat her with a space heater
a piece of furniture, egg beater, thermos
it may be disturbing, what i'm saying's cringeworthy
but i'm urinating on fergie, call shady number 81
surely i'm turning into the aaron hernandez of rap
state of emergency, the planet's having panic attacks
brady's returning, matter of fact i may be deserving
of a pat on the back like a patriots jersey
inexplicable stomach growl from the pit of it
like a fuckin' terrier hid in it
despicable, dumb it down, ridiculous
tongue is foul, shoot off at the fuckin' mouth
like a missile, a thunder cloud
hundred pound pistol, pull the trigger, this gun will sound
and you'll get a round like digital underground
and fuck ann coulter with a klan poster
with a lamp post, door handle, shutter
a damn bolt cutter, a sandal, a can opener
a candle, rubber, piano, a flannel, sucker
some hand soap, butter, a banjo and manhole cover
hand over the mouth and nose smother
trample ran over the tramp with the land rover
the band, the lambo, hummer and road runner
go ham donut, or go rambo, gut her, make an example of her
that's for sandra bland, ho, and philando
hannibal on the lam, no wonder i am so stubborn
i'm anti, can't no government handle a commando
your man don't want it
trump's a bitch, i'll make his whole brand go under (yeah)
and tell dre i'm meeting him in l.a
white bronco like elway, speeding
i'm 'bout to run over a chick, del rey cd in?
females stay beating 'em
bet you they'll lay bleeding, and yell, "wait," pleading
but screaming is pointless like feeding michel'le helium
leaving 'em pale-faced, medium-sized welt
straight treating 'em like a cellmate
seedy, i'm climbing hell's gate
bitch, i'm like your problems: self-made
meaning someone else's help ain't needed, 'cause i'maâ€”
