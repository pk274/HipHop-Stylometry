my friends can't understand this new me
that's understandable, man, but think how bananas you'd be
you'd be an animal too, if you were trapped in this fame and caged in it like a zoo
and everybody's looking at you, what you want me to do?
i'm starting to live like a recluse and the truth is
fame's starting to give me an excuse to be at a all time low
i sit alone in my home theater watching the same damn dvd
of the first tour, the last tour he was still alive
and it hurts so i fast forward, sleeping pills will make me feel alright
and if i'm still awake in the middle of the night
i'll just take a couple more, yeah you're motherfucking right
i ain't slowing down for no one, i am almost homeward bound
almost in a coma, yeah homie come on dole 'em out
daddy, don't you die on me, daddy, better hold your ground
fuck, don't i know the sound of that voice
yeah baby hold me down
