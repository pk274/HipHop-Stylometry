sandy hook, stoneman douglas
another lone-wolf gunman
sometimes i don't know what this
world has come to, it's blowin' up
this whole country is goin' nuts
and the nra is in our way
they're responsible for this whole production
they hold the strings to control the puppets
and they threaten to take away donor bucks
so they know the government won't do nothin'
and no one's budgin', gun owners' clutchin'
their loaded weapons
they love their guns more than our children
shh, i think another one just entered in our buildin'
and we'll be—


i feel sorry for this beat, sympathy pains for this track
this road is takin' me back
down memory lane with this rap
i can still look out in this crowd, be wowed and be taken aback
i'm simply stating a fact
i had wembley stadium packed
but now we're on a path headed to nowhere and fast
another terrorist attacks
like a tariff blows half of madison square up, alas
we perish in the blast
but that isn't scaring us, we pass
nowhere we're fearless, 'cause we're just—


ashes blowin' in the air
our world's on fire, but we don't care, yeah
(we don't give a… no, no)
wasted youth, always on the road
never lookin' back and we're never gettin' old
the skies are black, but our heart's made of gold (golden)
forget doin' what you're told (what we're told)


fuck doin' what you're told, act like a two-year-old

ashes blowin' in the air (so we're…)
our world's on fire, but we don't care, yeah
(we don't give a… no, no)
wasted youth, always on the road
we're never lookin' back and we're never gettin' old
the skies are black, but our heart's made of gold (golden)
forget doin' what you're told (what we're told)
hands up!


you can't tell us nothin'
hard-headed and we're stubborn
so, one ear and out the other
when we're young, we're young
who knows what the future for us could hold
another shooter? uh oh
no more tomorrows, we're done
and all we are is—


ashes blowin' in the air (so we're…)
our world's on fire, but we don't care (don't care, yeah)
(we don't give a… no, no)
wasted youth, always on the road
never lookin' back and we're never gettin' old
the skies are black, but our heart's made of gold (golden)
forget doin' what you're told (what we're told)
we're goin' nowhere
