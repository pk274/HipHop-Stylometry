temple, 'cause i'm the captain in this shit
snappin' up your lip, cappin' up and zipped
your whole clique in a bodybog, shot with a shotty mag
you got your ass dragged, 'cause you got beat like a fag
in a fag bar, stole a fucking jaguar
and we don't give a fuck, we steal any kind of car
whatever you got parked out in front of your house is gonna get stolen
we rollin' in the car that's stolen already, swollen like your colon
when you got beat up last week, and you had a gas leak
and you thought you was blowin' up, but you didn't
and instead you were skiddin', along the curb of a fucked up road
when it's icy out, we don't give a fuck, yo
james, like, let mе out
let me out of herе, the windows are rolled up and the car doors' locked
so i don't give a fuck, we're all gonna die together, james
so get off my fuckin' dock
yeah
