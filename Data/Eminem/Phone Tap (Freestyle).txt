alright, ugh
aight, one more time
yo, yo


i'm ice grillin' you, starin' you down with a gremlin grin
i'm eminem, you're a fag in a women's gym
i'm slim, cause shady is really a fake alias
to save me with in case i get chased by space aliens
a brainiac with a cranium packed full of more uranium
than a maniac saudi arabian
a highly combustible head, spasmatic
strapped to a craftmatic adjustable bed
laid up in a hospital in critical condition
i flat lined, jumped up and ran from the mortician
high speed, iv full of thai-weed
lookin' chinese with my knee's, stuck together like siamese
twins, joined at the groin like lesbians
pins and needles, hypodermic needles and pins
i hope god forgives me for my sins
it probably all depends on if i keep on killin' my girlfriends


yo, yo, yo, yo
eminem!
yo man, you going to jail for them rhymes man
yo, you sick!
i'm going to hell!
