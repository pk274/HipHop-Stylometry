(hey, you know i gotta say somethin on this track)
well i'm not a pimp or a player, see i'm more like the mayor
grab a bitch up by her hair like i just don't care
and swing her in the air (ahh!) i'm talkin major ass kick
toss a bitch out the house like kwame kirkpatrick
i'm a pimp, so i give a fuck about a bitch
but i don't make 'em trick, i'm rich (whoo!)
i don't need the chips, they don't walk the strip
but i could spit some game and i could talk some shit
i'm somethin like a pimp, similar to a mack
i ain't makin the news, i make my baby mama pick up the slack
drop cadillac, truck {*phone rings*} fuck, i gotta go
that's my bottom ho pagin me back - i'm a pimp
