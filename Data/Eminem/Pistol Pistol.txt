slick criminal wit', the shit i spit chews
(ain't go nowhere without my gun)
like a bullet came back that just missed and hit you
(i walk the streets, i pack my gun)
i say the type of shit parents slit their wrists to
(i go to sleep, i got my gun)
need an anthem to amp you, then this the shit to
(don't go nowhere without my gun)
too many enemies on my list to sift through
(ain't go nowhere without my gun)
nobody got my back in this bitch but this tool
(i walk the streets, i pack my gun)
sorry officer, i don't care how pissed it get you
(i go to sleep, i got my gun)
but i don't go nowhere without my pistol pistol
(don't go nowhere without my gun)


stepped in the door, waving the fo'-fo'
blazing at po-po, escaping and lay low
they call my tongue ya-yo, but i spit fire
i lit five inside a fucking dick-rider
the clip slider, love to blast a mag
you a fag, you love being ass to ass
grab a gun by the nose with the butt to gat-spank ya
never say that i'm a gangsta (now that's gangsta)
y'all niggas sound like jigga but act like 'pac
yo, my trigger got the flu and this gat might cough
it ain't nothing to tell, empty shells for the witness
i'm the hot nigga that's gon' put hell outta business
it won't be the same since we touching the game (nope)
make the hardest nigga in your crew, tuck in his chain
y'all think this shit's a game and i'm bluffing for fame? (ah, fuck it)
i'll squeeze off this tec until nothing remains (yeah, come on)

the only time that i'm at peace is when i'm close to one
'cause i don't know what's waiting for me when my vocals are done (nope)
tote the gun, it's my way of life and it works
these cowardly niggas'll put your fucking life in the dirt (ha-ha)
'cause it was wrong how they left my dog, he was priceless
alone in the streets, bleeding, staring, laying lifeless
that's why i'm heated, you never know who starts creeping (uh-huh)
waking you up with ak's while you lie sleeping
i'd rather pack the heat and not need it
rather than need one and not have it, i married this glock-matic
nowhere without my- *bang*


you know the sound
when i'm spinnin' 'round, spittin' these rounds from four pounds
while the whole crowd screamin' as loud from they mouths
as they possibly allow
nothing is parallel to makin' you carousel
aerial somersault like ferris wheels to a pair of shells
denaun carry the nine where i go
bullets whistle and hit you while i'm shooting at 5-0
some semi-automatic for static's the motto
spitting like *columbine kids* from colorado
