 haha

lately i just feel like there's too many pussies in rap
shady (ca$his) we gotta push 'em to the back
move 'em along, push 'em aside, don't get me wrong
i love the finger snaps and the claps into the song
it's got a catch but come on man, the raps
we all gotta step our game up; especially these lame fucks
who walk around with their chest out
just tryin to be down with anybody who's left now
better be down with them, huh
but i dare some bitch to say somethin about eminem
'cause i'm not in the mood to be playin around with dudes
i already seen two friends get shot in the head
and lay on the ground this year and, one didn't make it
proof, you are the truth
please don't let us come face to face with these boo-boo-hoo
fake-ass tattooed havin
fif', please tell 'em right now how hard it has been
for me to try and, stay out it
but they just won't quit runnin their mouth
at least 'til there's a gun in it; son of a bitch!
we all got shooters, yeah these days who doesn't?
and as far as the snaps and claps, i wasn't
dissin the south, that isn't what this is about
i just so sick of the beef, i don't even wanna see anymore
