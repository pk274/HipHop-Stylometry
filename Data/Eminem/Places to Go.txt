you mistakin' me for somebody that you should be testin'
you should be stressin', i'm finna fuckin' teach you a lesson (yeah)
rap 101's in session, em laced the track that i'm blessin'
smith & wesson's the weapon in case you was guessin', escape lesson (god, damn!)
cappin' 'em, kept in my benz, hot beginnin' to end (woo!)
watch the 22's spin, my hoes they perfect ten (come on!)
i got shot up but i got up and i'm back at it again
motherfuckers that thought i wouldn't win pretend to be friends
at first you fail, try, try, try, try again
i'm the best, don't you get it? forget it, when i spit it, it's crazy
you love it, admit it, you like that i live it, it's shady
aftermath in yo' ass, bitch
if it's not a classic, when it's done we trash it
flow i got it mastered, stunt and get yo' ass kicked, bastard (yeah)
when measures get drastic, glocks made out of plastic
cock it, aim it, blast it, run nigga, now stash it (come on!)
