i left my legacy hurt? fuckin' absurd
like a shepherd havin' sex with his sheep, fuck what you heard
all this talk in my ear, i got a idea
like the clerk when you tryna buy beer (id ya)
since on the mic, i'm a nightmare
fuck it, i thought this might be a good time to put woke me to rockabye
i got the bottle of nyquil right here (right here)
you want the sleep me to wake, you want slim shady ep
that's on the cd cover, sockin' my mirror (sockin' my mirror)
i promise not to cry crocodile tears (crocodile tears)
if you end up shocked at my lyrics (shocked at my lyrics)
marshall is dead in the water, but not that i care
dre said, "rock the boat" and the doc is my peer
so, it's unanimous, you're at attention, the planet's listenin'
and their banana splits again, which has its advantages
but when you got nothing to say except for the hand your dick is in
and if your plan's to stick it in janice dickinson
imagine if the temazepam is kickin' in, it's havin' you panic-stricken
you're trippin' off of tryptophan and tripped a fan in switzerland
just for askin' to autograph a picture
then ripped it in half and whipped it at him
and kicked his ass all the way back to michigan
but no matter how many rounds or if i get knocked down
in a bout and fell to the ground
i got a fighter's mentality, i'll get back up and fight with it
in fact, i'ma attackin' the mic with it
i'll make it sound (sound), sound like a vampire's bitin' it (bitin' it)
but i'd have to be dracula's sidekick (sidekick)
to be down for the count (haha), yeah
yo, album's (what?), out (yeah), now (uh)
pow (pow), wow (woo), i don't (huh), see no (uh) clouds (nah)
but ain't gon' (no) be no (huh) drought (uh-uh)
smile (no), frown (yeah), upside (ah) down (ya)
shut my (nope) mouth (yeah), how? (how)
that ain't what (what) i'm 'bout
shout (shout), showers (fuck it, ow, ow)
thuggin', thug it out (ow), 'cause
