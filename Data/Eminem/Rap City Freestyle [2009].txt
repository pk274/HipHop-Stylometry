woah, nelly, tell angelina jolie i'm ready
with petroleum jelly, to smear it all over me belly
and tell her she can hit me on me mobile, me celly
and meet in the salami section of the grocery deli
and maybe we can find us an appropriate telly
a motel 6 or 8, i think they both could be helly
i hit it, then i quit it and i told her "email me
and don't call me, i'll call you— can you feel me? ho, do you smell me?
animal instinct, cannibalistic
i just ran out of lipstick, man, i'm a twisted
sick, sadistic, son of a bitch, 666
broke his crucifix made out of sticks, then fixed it
chck-chck-chck, chick, chck-chck, chck-chck, chck!
now play it backwards: "muscle relaxers mixed with
liquid dilaudid, it's diluted for quick fix
you're delusional, illusions look realistic


i need christopher reeves to come and lay his verse
i think he can spit it better on medicine ball, first
off, i did not even realize the guy died
so i guess them christopher reeves jokes ain't gonna fly
oh! i'm on a roll, don't get me started
ellen got pissed at me, tried to push me and pussy-farted
with such accuracy, he aims and shoots the target
cupid's arrow done forced it, now look, sweetheart, it's
the kissin' bandit on a mission to leave ms. degeneres
disenchanted by men, now just listen, dammit
mr. rossi, i need no posse, i single handed-
-ly will steal your heart with a kiss, where should i plant it?
moi! baby, it's moi! and my repertoire
is running around in pink panties and leopard bra
and negligah, negligée, you say tomato, i say tomah-to
i'm tommy motola mariah, don't stop me, i'm on a roll
oh!
