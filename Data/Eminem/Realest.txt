guess i've really no right to complain much hip hop has been good to me huh
but when they say that i'm only top five 'cause i'm white why would i be stunned
my skin color's still working against me (what) 'cause second i should be to none
being white ain't why they put me at five (nope) it's why they can't put me at one (whoot)
they're comin' with more venom so the haters i'm aimin' it towards them and
all the envious rappers i'd torch if i'm on a joint with 'em
and that is the only retort is i'm not played in the clubs motherfucker put a cork in it
only reason they still play your shit in the clubs (why?) is 'cause you still perform in 'em (haha)
i am a guest in this house but i turned this bitch to a mansion
that's an expansion made it gargantuan england germany france and japan's in this bitch
even dubai because my music they do buy
you die tryin' this scientists two psy
​chiatrists could not un-screw my head up the blue eyed devil i never quit do i
naw cause you know you'll get washed like a bar of soap you pussy you wouldn't give a cigar to smoke
and i know it eats at your heart like an artichoke because you know that's how likely you are to choke
your heart is broke as i rip you apart i go bananas precede to spit every bar i wrote
i was spittin' before my mother's water broke it's not even close you bitch i'm by far the goat
gen zers actin' like rap experts zip up your gaps and close your mouths
bitch you ain't been on this planet long enough to tell me how rap's supposed to sound
ya'll need to stick to what you do best shootin' schools up yeah go load up rounds
in your parents' gats and go to class and let off with the strap and go to town
shout to the furious five and grandmaster flash but boy (what up doe)
there's someone who really is furious stay out his path his wrath avoid
and i'll be the last to toy with a juice head whose brain is like half destroyed
like a meteor hit it well there went melle mel we lost his ass to roids (damn)
god was like "i got him" but i'm gonna start him at the bottom of the barrel brought him in the world
with a ma that was on valium and his father was a coward taught him as a child when no fucking body was around
how to get himself up and out of poverty and now not even a growl in his stomach gotta be a hound
'til they put your body in the ground probably gonna sound like a cliché but when haters try to beat you down
say fuck 'em


i'm just playin', gen z, you know i love you
