remember me? i just don't give a fuck!
remember me? yeah, fuck you too!
remember me? i'm low down and i'm shifty!
remember me? i'm shady!


when i go out, i'ma go out shootin'
i don't mean when i die, i mean when i go out to the club, stupid!
i'm tryin' to clean up my fuckin' image
so i promised the fuckin' critics i wouldn't say “fuckin''” for six minutes
six minutes, slim shady, you're on!
my baby's mom, bitch made me an angry blonde
so i made me a song, killed her and put hailie on
i may be wrong, i keep thinkin' these crazy thoughts
in my cranium, but i'm stuck with a crazy mom
is she really on as much dope as you say she's on?
came home and somebody musta broke in the back window
and stole two loaded machine guns and both of my trench coats
six sick dreams of picnic scenes
two kids, sixteen, with m-16's and ten clips each
and them shits reach through six kids each
and slim gets blamed in bill clint's speech to fix these streets?!
fuck that! pbbt, you faggots can vanish to volcanic ash
and reappear in hell with a can of gas and a match
aftermath, dre, grab the gat, show 'em where it's at!
(what the fuck you starin' at, nigga?)


don't you remember me?!
remember me?!
remember me?!
remember me!! (slim shady!)
