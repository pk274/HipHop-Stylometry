since i'm in a position to talk to these kids and they listen
i ain't no politician, but i'll kick it with 'em a minute
'cause see, they call me a menace and if the shoe fits, i'll wear it
but if it don't, then y'all'll swallow the truth, grin and bear it
now who's the king of these rude, ludicrous, lucrative lyrics?
who could inherit the title, put the youth in hysterics
usin' his music to steer it, sharin' his views and his merits?
but there's a huge interference, they're sayin' you shouldn't hear it
maybe it's hatred i spew, maybe it's food for the spirit
maybe it's beautiful music i made for you to just cherish
but i'm debated, disputed, hated and viewed in america
as a motherfuckin' drug addict, like you didn't experiment?
now, now, that's when you start to stare at who's in the mirror
and see yourself as a kid again, and you get embarrassed
and i got nothin' to do but make you look stupid as parents
you fuckin' do-gooders, too bad you couldn't do good at marriage (haha)
and do you have any clue what i had to do to get here?
i don't think you do, so stay tuned and keep your ears glued to the stereo
'cause here we go, he's jigga-jur-jigga-jih-jigga
and i'm the sinister mr. kiss-my-ass is just a


renegade, never been afraid to say
what's on my mind at any given time of day
'cause i'm a renegade
never been afraid to talk about anything
(anything?), anything (anything)

'cause i'm a renegade
never been afraid to holler about anything

see, i'm a poet to some, a regular modern-day shakespeare
jesus christ, the king of these latter-day saints here
to shatter the picture in which of that as they paint me as
a monger of hate, satanist, scatter-brained atheist
but that ain't the case, see, it's a matter of taste
we as a people decide if shady's as bad as they say he is
or is he the latter, a gateway to escape?
media scapegoat who they can be mad at today
see, it's as easy as cake, simple as whistlin' "dixie"
while i'm wavin' the pistol at sixty christians against me
go to war with the mormons, take a bath with the catholics
in holy water, no wonder they tried to hold me under longer
i'm a motherfuckin' spiteful, delightful eyeful
the new ice cube, motherfuckers hate to like you
what did i do? (huh?), i'm just a kid from the gutter
makin' his butter off these bloodsuckers, 'cause i'm a motherfuckin'
