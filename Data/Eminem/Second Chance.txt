yeah
it's my life
my own words i guess
have you ever loved someone so much, you'd give an arm for?
not the expression, no, literally give an arm for?
when they know they're your heart
and you know you were their armour
and you will destroy anyone who would try to harm her
but what happens when karma, turns right around and bites you?
and everything you stand for, turns on you to spite you?
what happens when you become the main source of her pain?
"daddy look what i made", dad's gotta go catch a plane
"daddy where's mommy? i can't find mommy where is she?"
i don't know go play hailie, baby, your daddy's busy
daddy's writing a song, this song ain't gonna write itself
i'll give you one underdog then you gotta swing by yourself
then turn right around in that song and tell her you love her
and put hands on her mother, who's a spitting image of her
that's slim shady, yeah baby, slim shady's crazy
shady made me, but tonight shady's rocka-by-baby


you look like you're in another world
but i can read your mind
how can you be so far away
lying by my side


you look like you're in another world
but i can read your mind
how can you be so far away
lying by my side


you look like you're in another world
but i can read your mind
how can you be so far away
lying by my side
