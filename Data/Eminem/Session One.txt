ladies and gentlemen, make some noise!
aw, shit! yeah
you ready to get this shit started or what? a'ight
well, i brought some friends with me too


now i ain't back just for the sake of just sayin', “i'm back”
i could relax, but i'd rather stack ammo on tracks
couple xanax, light a couple wax candles, then black-
-out and relapse 'til i yack jack daniels and 'gnac
burp bubbles, attitude's immaturin', double
shot of bacardi, party, vision is blurrin'—woah-ho
i can't see shit, my words get to slurrin'—uh-oh!
you can call me r. kelly now, you're in trouble!
what's occurrin' before, after, and durin' the show
has no bearin' on the bad news i'm bearin', woah
what is it, wordplay? no, i'm pushin' you out the do'
so, suck my dick on the couch if you wanna cushion the blow
now stomp your fuckin' feet 'til you get to squishing a ho
it's pandemo-nium, standing o when you see him, oh
damn, baby, you look good, you're givin' me wood
you should pull over like a sweatshirt with a hood
it's neck work, get our polly on, you and me, both
break bread while i'm coppin' over this game to pinch a loaf
now, homie, who's your favorite pain in the ass? who claims to be
spittin' the same flames as me? i'm kanye when he crashed
in other words, i got the hood on smash,  like i stepped on the gas
destroyed the front end, deployed the damn airbags from the dash
went through 'em and laughed, came back an hour after the accident
and bit a goddamn jawbreaker in half!
so stop fakin' the funk and start shakin' your ass
slaughterhouse in the house with the caucasian of rap
and just blaze on the track, what the fuck's more amazin' than that
slut? answer me that! royce, where you at?
