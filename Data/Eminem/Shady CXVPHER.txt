my name is marshall, i'm reppin' that motherfuckin' motor city, bitch
i just turned slaughterhouse to a quintet
began to trend-set, murdered a friend's pet
made shit as ill as it can get went in-depth
like a fucking vignette and two bars skins wet
i'm already covered in sweat and i wasn't even ready to come in yet
ahh, let me set this drink down
beat up a gal, start beef with her pal
probably be wild 'til i'm wrinkled and senile
and "rap god" was a freestyle
off the top of the dome piece while i was 'sleep on the couch
and i'm freestyling now
i need a towel, sweat leaks from my brow
it's burning my eyes, my cerebral is foul
'cause shit i'm thinking about should be illegal
i need my head banned like the guy who left cleveland ohio
and went to south beach with his talents
scream "fuck you" on the way out and wink with a smile
this whole game can eat a dick, i'm going back deep underground
but right now i'm back on that bullshit and you i'm singling out
'cause you're so fucking outdated you should mingle a while
what the fuck is this klusterfuk of busters?
bunch of buster douglas', motherfuckers is one hit wonders
one swing and you're crowned
knocked one out the park, one catchy jingle and now
you think you fucking with me 'cause you sold like 300 thou?
bitch, i can jump without my feet ever leaving the ground
reach up, swing from a cloud with 3 thousand people around
evil and vile enough to leap in the crowd
and heave a child in a sinkhole on cinco de mayo
when i'm sprinkled in pico de gallo
mardi gras beads in a towel
i just made that up
i don't know much spanish, i'm not bilingual
but i'll show you a mexican stand off
between just these two amigos
'cause neither really wants to say what we're thinking out loud
but i sure as fuck think i know how to read body english, no doubt
'cause we're trying to kill each other, but lyrically
the fuck is humility? what is a real emcee?
royce, he came up in this shit with me
never spit that hustler shit, it wasn't a fit for me
let them adjust 'til they just get the gist of me
just not giving a fuck and plus with the history
of muscular distrophy, it wasn't a mystery
why this middle finger was stuck in this upward positioning
so what in the fuck is a list to me?
i'm used to not being on it, i expect it out 'em
heck wit' 'em, i get my respect without 'em
ain't really been into diamonds since i put my first record out
but i could put a chain around my second album
and wear it as a neck medallion
became a millionaire, went downhill from there
became civil, office swivel chair, sterling silverware
screaming life is still unfair til i get a real career
the fuck am i gonna do until then? this job is too fulfilling
two ga-jillion pairs of super villain shoes to fill in
a mood to kill till i plow my coupe de ville
into some children at the food pavilion at build-a-bear
warrior's mind, i’m pro-hydrocodone euphoria
in the drug emporium line, i'm soaring
i'm pouring vicodin four at a time ignoring the warning signs on 'em 'fore i go four wheeler riding
gory and violent, horrifying
you surely won't find no one more abhorring
than i am with this retaliatory of rhyming for gloria steinem
but i finger her like a witness, show me a line-up
i usually am abusive, but excuse me, ma'am
i guess i must've threw you for a loop like toucan sam
when i said i could use the sample 'cause you's a tramp
but look how you react to this trigger like
when i call you a bigger dyke than the hoover dam
you're playing right into lex luthor's hand
it's such a ruthless plan, might even lose a fan
but fuck it, superman wouldn't change in a phone booth for stan
i'm a brand new being like grand puba's band
happy as anderson cooper having a tuba crammed
in his pooper with lubricant...wait, that's too... i can't
since honesty is the best policy i'll give you the old college try
try to acknowledge my mistakes, probably won't qualify
as a gentleman and a scholar, but it's time that i swallow pride
and say that i'm sorry, sorry i can't apologize
i think of all them times i compromised my bottom lines
and thought of rhymes that sodomized your daughter's minds
then i'm like dollar signs
but i may fight for gay rights especially if they dyke
is more of a knockout than janay rice
play nice, bitch, i'll punch lana del rey right
in the face twice like ray rice in broad daylight
in plain sight of the elevator surveillance
til her head is banged on the railing
then celebrate with the ravens
never date an assailant who self-medicates with inhalants
i'd meditate, but i may need a better way to escape
the aggression, rage and the anger
cause leg restraints on the ankles
heavy weights and an anchor with handcuffs in chains
just ain't enough to contain it
but i'd still get the same respect as jay if i came on
stage in a fucking negligée everyday and liz claiborne
devastated from breakup with kate hudson
wait slut, your friends, what are they gonna say
'cause makeup ain't gonna cover
that eye that's seven-eighths of the way shut
peppersprayed with your face cut
made my bank like a lay up
off these effing skanks on the way up
oh, bitch thinks she's heaven-sent
it's evident that she ain't never been with seven inches
yes, i said seven, i measured it
seven inches from the floor
while i'm standing on the fourth floor balcony
at the sheraton while i'm stretching it
bitch, i'm a pimp so a limp dick is all you'll ever get
so if she's hesitant to get the hint
i'll bet you that i get the message sent who she's messing with
hella quick when i tell a chick not to ever use sex as a weapon
when i step in and beat the wretched wench with a crescent wrench
existential detriment to a lesbian devil
and the unpleasant stench of an estrogen level
a separatist like a chechnian rebel
impressionist with a pencil
a pessimist, with his lips pressed against
the edge of this red bull
pedal to the metal i'm rippin' this shit cause right away i'll give it to a bitch like a pedestrian, deadly as ever
you see what kind of effects she has on the opposite sex when i push her flexible little sexy ass through a plate of plexiglass
shadyxv as perplexing as
the last fifteen years and i'm predicting my next relapse
when i spit these lyrics so don't look at me weird
when i start shifting gears and shit re-smears all over britney spears
and these little disney queers
who use chicks for beards?
just made that up too...
oh and the shady 2.0
we wrote it in roman numerals like they do for the super bowls
'cause it's supposed to confuse you hoes
so flows lose you as usual, so juvenile
2 year old when i go to the studio
it's only music but don't be foolish though
you don't know me through it ho but you can blow me to it though
in my homie's buick
been known to lose it though so if i overdo it you drove me to it
when i step in the vocal booth like i'm supposed to do
and murder you on a fuckin' track like tony stewart
in one take, if i fuck up and i don't redo it
you couldn't sound grown on a beat if you were moaning to it
the day i don't say fuck you (w)all, you can throw me through it
rootinest-tootinest, shootin' this from the hip
with the sentiments, eminem isn't penning them for the women
i'm an enemy to them and the epitome of an inconsiderate idiot
but they consider me equivalent to chlamydia
they tryna get rid of me gadzooks
but i stiggity stand for the figgity flag
of the united states and the freedom, i distribute these raps through
and if i catch you doing anything
hindering or prohibiting that after i get me the
tattoo of your lips on my ass i'ma be literally
pickin' up and deliberately whippin' the statue of liberty at you, woooh!
fuck it
got it somewhere in there probably, i don't know
