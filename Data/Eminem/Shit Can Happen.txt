bitch
yeah
shit can happen, shit can happen
shit can happen, shit can happen
shit can happen, shit can happen
shit can happen, shit can happen


picture me sitting in a jail cell rotting (shit)
or barricaded in a motel with twelve shotguns
so when the cops come knocking each hand's got one
cocked, ready to dump slugs heavy as shotputs
one man army, guns can't harm me
young and ornery, worse than my uncle ronnie
ever since i got my first gun pulled on me
i can't stop airing out my dirty laundry
middle fingers flipped at censorship
your friends just flipped over the swift penmanship
ever since i spit some shit on infinite
i've been giving it a hundred and ten percent
'cause when i vent, most of my energy's spent on enemies
eighty percent of what i invent is hennessy (*burp*)
twenty percent is from being hungry as sin
10's because i love being under your skin, yeah (shit)
shit can happen, so stick to rapping
quit the yapping or i'ma lift the mac and
that can lead to another mishap happening
skip the crap, get the can of whoopass cracking


shit can happen
it can and it will (nigga, nigga)
shit can happen
fuck around with amityville
shit can happen
and you die, insanity spills
shit can happen
from the mentality of twelve motherfuckers
shit can happen
in six different bodies with their personalities split
shit can happen
fucking you up with hit after hit
shit can happen
sticking you up with clip after clip
shit can happen
making you suck dick after dick
shit can happen
dirty motherfucking dozen
shit can happen
the kon artis
shit can happen
motherfucking peter s. bizarre
swifty mcvay
the kuniva
dirty father-fucking harry
putting you down in a cemetery
you get buried
all you of you motherfuckers
suck our motherfucking cocks
we are not playing
we are not playing
we are not bullshitting
this is not a motherfucking joke
all of you motherfuckers get smoked
