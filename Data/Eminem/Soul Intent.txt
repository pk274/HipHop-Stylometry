i don't got perfect eyesight
but i could spot your fake ass in the dark wearin' solid black
makin' yourselves look pitiful makes us all look wack
so don't stand up there on me with those 
are you in it for the profit? does money in ya pocket
mean more than respect? or do ya play for sport
and that's all that's really important
compete for competition comes before any check, tell me, what's your intent?
are you lookin' at this as simply just a quick way to make a ducat
or does your heart go in each tune?
i'm interested in your purpose 'cause this shit's becomin' a circus
and us jugglers need some elbow room


most independent companies are full of crap
tryna get me to write a booty rap with a pop feel
but i wouldn't sell out for a scooby snack
here's some hairspray, better make up a nickname
yell enough to gain quick fame, and we'll get you airplay
but i ain't sellin' out, i could give a fuck less how much money
a label is willing to start shelling out, so here we are
we're all sitting in the basement getting overpatient
while these idiots are making shitty hits and hitting gold

are you in it for the profit? does money in ya pocket
mean more than respect? or do ya play for sport
and that's all that's really important
compete for competition comes before any check, tell me, what's your intent?
are you lookin' at this as simply just a quick way to make a ducat
or does your heart go in each tune?
i'm interested in your purpose 'cause this shit's becomin' a circus

i'll probably live more than twice than
the average rappers lifespan, 'cause half of 'em are dyin' out
from growin' a bigger nose than barbra streisand
'cause you ain't never seen hard times, if my experiences were visible
you'd see hard times to make you miserable
reminiscing back to when i couldn't even afford to record a track
if i was robbed i'd have to fight to my death for my quarter back
my whole fuckin' life has been full of emptiness
so what makes a hollow heart 
are you in it for the profit? does money in ya pocket
mean more than respect? or do ya play for sport
and that's all that's really important
compete for competition comes before any check, tell me, what's your intent?
are you lookin' at this as simply just a quick way to make a ducat
or does your heart go in each tune?
