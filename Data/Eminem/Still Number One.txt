for the next joint, i like to go back to the classics
ayo, kris, hit 'em with another one!


peace to thirstin howl, a. l., and wordsworth
my mother smoked crack, i had a premature birth
i'm just a nerd cursed with badly disturbed nerves
who wanna be the one to step up and get served first?
99% of aliens prefer earth
come here to rule the planet, startin' with your turf
i hid a secret message inside of a word search
with smeared letters, runnin' together in blurred spurts
hang with male chauvinist pigs and perverts
who point water pistols at women and squirt shirts
been a bad boy since diapers and gerbers
my first words were "bleed, bleed!" and "curse, curse!"
never had it and i still don't deserve dirt
my breath still stinks, and i'm on my third cert
digging out my stitches, hollering, "nurse, nurse!
you said this shot would numb it, this shit just hurts worse!"


slim shady! (?)! (?)!
