it is not about lyrics anymore
it's about a hot beat and a catchy hook

if we gotta dumb down our style and a-b-c it
then so be it, 'cause nowadays, these kids just
don't give a shit 'bout lyrics
all they wanna hear is a beat and that's it
long as they can go to the club and get blitzed
pick up some chicks and get some digits
and the dj's playing them hits
"oh, this my jam! this my shit!
we don't know a word to a verse, all we know is the chorus
'cause the chorus repeats the same four words for us"
and the song's ginormous, the whole formula's switched
'cause we don't know anymore what are hits
is it the beat? is it the rap?
is it a finger snap or the same 808 clap?
and how do we adapt and get trl votes
when thirteen-year-olds control the remotes?
and ashlee's got a brand new nose
we gotta put some new em-pha-sis on our syl-la-la-bles


they said thirty's the new twenty, funny
must mean forty's the new thirty, interesting
'cause ever since then, it's been, in a sense, an extension
for veteran rappers that are better than half of
the shit comin' out right now, it's all trash
the torch is gonna burn out before it gets passed
jay said it's his last, then 50 and em
then what? detox drops, what do we got then?
so now our whole camps is runnin' around
scrambling over what to do
gamblin' every time we put a record out
just lookin' for that hook (wait, dre, look!)


shorty, i love you
and you love me too
we were meant to be
'cause, shorty, you love me
and i love you too
and i promise i'll be true to you


shorty, i love you
and you love me too
we were meant to be
'cause, shorty, you love me
and i love you too
and i promise i'll be true to you


it is not about lyrics anymore
it is not about lyrics anymore
it's about a hot beat, a hot beat
it's about a hot beat, a hot beat
a hot-hot-hot beat and a catchy hook
a hot-hot-hot beat and a catchy hook
nobody gives a damn about them syllables
syl-la-la-bles, whatever they are
i don't care if you gotta rhyme "schmoe," "mo," "joe," "toe," and "glow"
