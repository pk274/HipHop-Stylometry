don't ask me what's up with the hoes, i'm still working the kinks out
love stinks, that explains all this anger that's spillin' out
and i ain't chilling out, got an oscar but i'm still a grouch
i use it as a doorstop and a prop for the broken leg for the couch
yelawolf, shady, tony-touch, slaughterhouse
yeah the swat team 'bout to break them flyswatters out
go to hell in a drought, break ice waters out
nice try shorty wop, we can windowshop the jewelry store
but christ for that price coulda bought a house
besides only thing i ever had iced out was my heart since i started out
itâ€™s f.y.i, if ya ain't knowing
what, go with you? where? nah, ain't going
oh wait, you wanna date? oh, well in that case ho, it's june 8th, oh!
and kinda like beethoven composin' a symphony of hate
so much hate woven into these raps
he stitches a bitch, straight sewin'
shit, i'm beginning to hate clothing
i hate overalls 'cause they remind me of hoes
for christ's sake, they're shaped like an h woah and
you know what else starts with h though?
hockey, shit, thought i had the place flowing
i hate to put you on ice but
you already had 3 periods in 60 minutes, great going
plus you remind me of cocaine, ho
you always in the mirror with your face
so, i feel an urge to put you all in a line
and chop you with a razor blade, yo wait, i'm an a-hole
devil with a halo
hell yeah, i'd nail j-lo... to the railroad
say i won't! better hope you can stay afloat
when i take the wind out your sailboat
but, i ain't playing yo! dope as shady?
don't kid yourself, bitch you ain't even a baby goat
