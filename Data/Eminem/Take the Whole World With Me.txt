i'm in a soundproof booth without a roof
drunk off 180 proof vodka with dr. ruth
we in the vocal room inhalin magic markers
sitting in the dark lightin our blunts with sparklers
we got my man pacewon behind the boards
because we tied the engineer up with outlet cords
bizarre's in tha lobby with the beatles
smokin bowls, pokin holes in his veins with dirty needles
we get all doped up from poppin uppers
and run a train on foxy brown without rubbers
smokin homegrown drugs
that's why you can barely tell what the fuck we're saying like bone thugs
hittin blunts till my lungs get too much smoke
and take one more short toke before i snort coke
shit, i been doing lines all day
my mind's all clay from smelling pine sol spray
what, no hold up hold up hold up
smokin laced weed wrapped up in a fruit roll up
my lungs are all swol' up about to bust open
i'm just hopin i don't die from snortin crushed motrin
i need drugs, somebody fix me
when i die i'm a try to take the whole world with me
12 bluntz plus i'm bringin ya girl with me
when i die i'm a try to take the whole world with me
i'm not comin' back, so don't send no one to get me
when i die i'm a try to take the whole world with me
fuck that, gimmee all my shit free
when i die i'm a try to take the whole world with me
