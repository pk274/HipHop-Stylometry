his palms are sweaty, knees weak, arms are heavy
there's vomit on his sweater already, mom's spaghetti
he's nervous, but on the surface, he looks calm and ready
to drop bombs, but he keeps on forgetting
what he wrote down, the whole crowd goes so loud
he opens his mouth, but the words won't come out
he's chokin', how? everybody's jokin' now
the clock's run out, time's up, over, blaow
snap back to reality, ope, there goes gravity
ope, there goes rabbit, hе choked, he's so mad
but he won't givе up that easy, no, he won't have it
he knows his whole back's to these ropes, it don't matter
he's dope, he knows that, but he's broke, he's so stagnant
he knows when he goes back to this mobile home, that's when it's
back to the lab again, yo, this old rhapsody
better go capture this moment and hope it don't pass him


you better lose yourself in the music
the moment, you own it, you better never let it go (go)
you only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
this opportunity comes once in a lifetime, yo
you better lose yourself

i can swallow a bottle of **** and i'll feel like godzilla
better hit the deck like the card dealer
my whole squad's in here, walking around the party
a cross between a zombie apocalypse and b-bobby "the—
this beat is cray-cray, ray j, h-a-h-a-h-a
laughing all the way to the bank, i spray flames
they cannot tame or placate the


monster
you get in my way, i'ma feed you to the monster (yeah)
i'm normal during the day, but at night, turn to a monster (yeah)
when the moon shines like ice road truckers
i look like a villain outta those blockbusters
godzilla, fire spitter, monster
**** on the dance floor, and on the louis v carpet
fire, godzilla, fire, monster
**** on the dance floor, and on the louis v (monster)


trigger happy, pack ****, but it's black ink
evil half of the bad meets
evil, that means take a back seat
take it back to fat beats with a maxi single
look at my rap sheet, what attracts these people
is my 'gangsta', ****, like apache with a catchy jingle
i stack chips, you barely got a half-eaten cheeto
fill 'em with the venom and eliminate 'em
other words, i minute maid 'em
i don't wanna hurt 'em, but i did, i'm in a fit of rage
i'm **** again, nobody will evade
i'm finna **** 'em and dump all their **** in the lake
obliterating everything, incinerate a renegade
i'm here to make anybody who want it with the pen afraid
but don't nobody want it, but they're gonna get it anyway
'cause i'm beginnin' to feel like i'm **** ill
i'm attila, **** or be ****, i'm a **** bee, the vanilla gorilla
you're bringin' the **** within me outta me
you don't wanna be the enemy of the demon who entered me
and be on the receivin' end of me, what stupidity it'd be
every bit of me's the epitome of a spitter
when i'm in the vicinity, ****, you better duck
or you finna be **** the minute you run into me
a hundred percent of you is a fifth of a percent of me
i'm 'bout to **** finish you, ****, i'm unfadable
you wanna battle, i'm available, i'm blowin' up like an inflatable
i'm undebatable, i'm unavoidable, i'm unevadable
i'm on the toilet bowl, i got a trailer full of money and i'm paid in full
i'm not afraid to pull a—


man, stop
