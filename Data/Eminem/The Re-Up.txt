boom boom chuck, boom b-boom chuck
boom boom chuck, boom b-boom chuck
boom boom chuck, boom b-boom chuck
boom boom chuck, we should do something like that, yeah (yeah!)


there's never been this, much of a menace in this game as this
and it's the most sinister duo in the business
once again, it's the illest and realest killas
the most villainous dre protege, shady apprentice
drop them zeros and get with these heroes
do you want losers or winners? this music is in us, and it's
not over till we say it's finished and g-unit spinners
will keep spinnin', this is hip-hop when it's in it's
truest form, the greatest, hate us or love us
make voodoo dolls of us and keep sticking them pins in us
thick as his skin is or as short as his wick is
the trick is to be able to walk big as his dick is
and as sick as his music is, or was, still is
whatever, forever, he will be the illest
to ever sh-shock the world, what to do next?
he's already reconciled with his {ex}
a chainsaw and an axe
choke a bitch to death, strangle her neck
while we have sex, while bill clinton plays the sax
i sprays the facts, yeah, bring shady on back
the maniac of rap, devil baby on crack
resurrect? i never left, baby, i'm bad
i've gone mad, my comrade dre's the automatic
says i'm too broke to fix, way beyond that
i may be off drugs, but it's made me off-track (*bl-la-la*)
in fact, this right here very well could be the last rap
i ever do spit, i'll never do shit, that's that
fuck it, i quit, suck on a dick, jackass
i'm done with this whack-ass rap, kiss my black ass!


boom boom chuck, boom b-boom chuck!
boom boom chuck, go 'head front, get fucked up!
boom boom chuck, boom b-boom chuck!
boom boom chuck, yeah, that's what's up! (now...)
boom boom chuck, boom b-boom chuck!
boom boom chuck, i hit your ass up!
boom boom chuck, boom b-boom chuck!
boom boom chuck, yeah, that's what's up! (yeah!)
boom boom chuck, boom b-boom chuck!
boom boom chuck, (it's the re-up!)
shady...
