meat cleaver, leave a gash in a bitches ass
see her dreams of being an r&b singer diva
leave her face, cut her from the waist
ah man what a waste, of a pretty face
and this place ain't just safe, it's just straight gangsta
it ain't just new york or l.a. that bangs no more
there's latin coun' kings here
southside, four, east side and gansen
nothin' but ganglands and, spray paint cans
and when that van rolls up, man they ain't glancing
that window rolls down and that tre-eight's dancing
and them shooters don't miss, homie they hate chancing
straight for the dome and it's vacate fast and
get the fuck outta dodge 'fore that blue dodge flashing
red and blue lights, no ambulance, you got flattened
and this was not supposed to be no detroit anthem
but just so ya know, if ya see them d-boys passing
