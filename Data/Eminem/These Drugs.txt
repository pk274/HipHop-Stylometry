it's… (it's…) be… (be…) …cause (…cause) of… (of…)
these drugs i do; that's why i do the things i do
it's because of these drugs that i do that make me
do these things that i do, do these things that i do
be… cause… of…
these drugs i do; that's why i do the things i do


my music is therapeutic for whoever's there to use it
it's like, lucifer's here to influence listeners through it
you probably do what it said to do just from listenin' to it
it's got the power to get you to do it (come on!)
so when the shit comes on, i wanna see some shit jump off
some bitch get slapped, some motherfucking kid get stomped (aaahhh!)
so get this song, go run out and buy this disc
and try this shit, as much coke as i just did
'cause times like these, got me doin' lines like these
plus, i grab a pencil every time that i light weed
it's probably because of the drugs; shady does what he does
and is what it is; i'm dizzy, bizzy, visit these kids


hey, stephanie (hi!) let's take some ecstasy (okay!)
now pull your pants down, bitch, and have sex with this dog next to me (huh?)
‘til i'm dead i'm takin' blunts to the head
needles in my broken leg, listen to grateful dead
these mescalines got me sure
that i can fuck any whore with genital warts on the warped tour
who slipped this downer in my snapple?
cussin' out interscope (bizarre, you're signed to capitol!)
fuck it, i was born with half a brain
sniffin' 'caine, at celebrity basketball games
you motherfuckers think i'm a gimmick
'cause i got a cash money tattoo and roll with no limit (uuuuhhhh!)
the last time i sniffed blow
i ended up in denver, colorado at an iggy pop show
bizarre be smokin' a half a pound
fuckin' the engineer's wife, while he's mixin' my song down


it's… (it's…) be… (be…) …cause (…cause) of… (of…)
these drugs i do; that's why i do the things i do
it's because of these drugs that i do that make me
do these things that i do, do these things that i do
be… cause… of…
these drugs i do; that's why i do the things i do


aaaahhhh…!
watch tonight, you'll admit that i'm a fiend
pop beans, 'scalines, along with amphetamines
ghetto kings, meddling with the smell of greens
got a jell-o spleen, and see yellow rings (ooohhh…)
blue pills and purple mushrooms
(hey, little girl, you got a curfew, don't you?)
missin' since yesterday, perfect just for rape
see, i'm on judgment day, numb from special k
two tabs of x and vitamin c
swallow hennessey along with tylenol 3
grindin' the teeth at the signs of the e
i lost six days at a time in the week
the crime in the street hold your parents for ransom
while d12 gang rape marilyn manson
in twelve hours we blow a pound of the chronic
barf up my stomach linin', drown in my vomit


it's… (it's…) be… (be…) …cause (…cause) of… (of…)
these drugs i do; that's why i do the things i do
it's because of these drugs that i do that make me
do these things that i do, do these things that i do
be… cause… of…
these drugs i do; that's why i do the things i do
be… cause… of…
these drugs i do; that's why i do the things i do
it's because of these drugs that i do that make me
do these things that i do, do these things that i do
be… cause… of…
these drugs i do; that's why i do the things i do
be… cause… of…
these drugs i do; that's why i do the things i do


'cause i like, i always tell people, you know what i'm sayin'?
like, if you got an addiction, don't admit it, to nobody, you know what i'm sayin'?
keep that shit to yourself, because if anybody sees that, you know what i'm sayin'?
when you're out in the public eye and shit, they're always gonna think that you're on that shit, even if you're not
that's why i always tell my friends, you know what i'm sayin'?
but, i mean, like, for me, i don't give a fuck; i'll probably end up dyin' from this shit one day
probably pick up a newspaper in the morning and it's like, "eminem dies from drug overdose"
you know what i'm sayin'? and—
and my friends, they ain't no fuckin' better, you know what i'm sayin'?
they ain't nothin' but influences, bad influences to me, so
it's peer pressure, shit is like all peer pressure
that's what it boils down to, and… i give in to it, so do they
