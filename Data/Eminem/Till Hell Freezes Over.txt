uh-uh, uh-uh, uh-uh-uh-uh (alright, i got it)
uh-uh-uh-uh-uh, uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh
yo yo yo yo yo (this is)
this is my motherfuckin' anthem (hip-hop)
to hip-hop music (anthem)
'cause i'ma keep doin' hip-hop music
until the day that i die, aight? (until the motherfuckin' day that i die, bitch)


yo, i'm into voodoo, tarot cards and ouija boards
lightin' candles campin' out at haunted beach resorts
i write the dark shit, and rap about perverted violence
ghost stories of people murdered on deserted islands
dressed in jean shorts, high tops and tube socks (ugh)
holdin' a rifle, with a life full of drama like 2pac's
jumpin' off rooftops drunk after i do shots
landin' in someone's backyard gettin' chewed up by two rotts
i got a new watch and two rings with huge rocks
this rap shit got cash comin' out the blue like nude cops
i used to sell pizzas, now i got twelve visas
so tell jesus that i'ma quit sinnin' when hell freezes


that's why my brain is out of order
that's probably why my nights are gettin' colder and my days seem shorter
but as the world turns and i keep growin' older
i'll be livin' this hip-hop till hell freezes over
bitch, till hell freezes over
i'll be livin' this hip-hop till hell freezes over
and as the world turns and i keep growin' older
i'll be livin' this hip-hop till hell freezes (till hell freezes over)


yo, i used to be too heavy in that cruisin' gratiot crap
i think i fucked my head up listenin' to acid rap
i go to parties bumpin' nasty nas's new song
and smoke pot till i get high and stare at shit for too long
like this weed is laced, ain't it? it tastes tainted
the whole place fainted, i woke up with my face painted (what!)
spaced out like sci-fi tv, "fuck icp, buy my cd!" (yeah)
is what i'm screamin' while i'm handin' out promo tapes of my debut (ugh)
tellin' bitches, "let me eat your pussy while i shave you!"
ain't no shame in my game (uh-uh), i turn the party out
makin' everybody shout for the rapper with potty mouth


that's why my brain is out of order
that's probably why my nights are gettin' colder and my days seem shorter
but as the world turns and i keep growin' older
i'll be livin' this hip-hop till hell freezes over (yeah)
bitch, till hell freezes over
i'll be livin' this hip-hop till hell freezes over
and as the world turns and i keep growin' older
i'll be livin' this hip-hop till hell freezes over
