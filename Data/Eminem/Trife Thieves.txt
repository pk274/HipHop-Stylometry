i'll shove a gun in ya grill, greasy and heated
smothered in hot mustard, so when i feed it to you it's easy to eat it (eat this)
you need to be immediately treated
while you breathin' and you'll be leavin' the receivin' room this evenin' with jesus
you hate on us and we'll be waitin' on eight corners
swarmin' ya hood with a thousand angry skateboarders (c'mon)
i hop in a jeep, slam on the gas and charge you
and bombard you in the car that your mom bought you
fuck around and get choked and found in a moat
floatin' around drowned, face down in a boat (damn)
i'll pile five dudes in a pinto and pull up
to the 7 mile drive-through at mcdonald's and pile-drive you
i got the power to snatch a motherfucker out of his car
when he rides by me at ninety miles an hour
this place is my house, i might as well erase my face
with white out, 'cause y'all can't see me like mase's eyebrows
