the story i'm about to tell is a true story
and my family knows it's a true story
that's why they might not wanna listen


i never asked to be born, so don't blame me for the crap i did
you're the one who made the choice to have me
i'm sorry for the trouble i've caused my ratty mom and daddy
if they spent a bit more time with me, they'd've noticed
they was raising 
it's time for mom to get a brand new man
but pops, mama said (uh) he'll support us better than you can (ha!)
she don't like him, but she says we'll have to supplement
'cause we don't got no money and now the landlord wants to up the rent (huh)
so he takes care but he told me to get my hair cut if i don't 
now i'm flown right back to the motherfucking terrordome
and puberty's got my voice deeper than down to a baritone
now i'm fitting dad's shoes, but right when i hit the door
the son of a bitches recognize a lad who's nothin' but bad news, ha
mama wept crocodile tears of joy
while i step, papa smiled "here's our boy!"
fuck the jivin', you don't care how i've been
i'm almost big enough for driving, i'm 13 and 5'10"
and i'm growing up at a fast rate, i just discovered i'm heterosexual
so i went around grabbing the butts of my female classmates
i get suspension, plus immoderate punishment
we would've still
