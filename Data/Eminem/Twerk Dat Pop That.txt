i’m in vip with no id with a pint of beam
lightin' cheeba, wylin’ the fuck out like bieber at nineteen
or ice-t in the 90s
frightening in some nikes slut, nice d’s
there a slight breeze? don’t like me? well then bite me
there might be a better chance of flight 370 turning up than us, bitch (highly unlikely)
little dyke think ‘cause i’m libra - you're pisces, and you’re feisty
that you're like me and you might find that we’re like minded
we ain’t nothing alike diva, you like sleeves
i'm a wife beater you white tease
bet you like skiing though right skeez?
the way you’re balancing yourself on the poles
why don’t you grab this one and do the right thing like spike lee?
and look out like you’re sightseeing and invite me in the back and bite me in the (god damn)
shake that ass and titties cassidy felt that
dick so fat it could practically snap her chastity belt strap
standing all the way back where my hotels at
she actually fell back and landed in someone else lap
and laughed cuz she thought she sat on pharrell’s hat
(twerk dat, pop that)
