yeah
sometimes i wonder, really, what did my closed head injury do?
i'm literally missin' a screw, but it seems like my memory's too vivid to forget the shit i've been through (yeah)
so as my residuals grew, i remembered those kids who were cruel
same individuals at elizabeth little and essentially used them as the fuel
who would've knew what a pencil could do though, so mentally screwed
they said, "marshall, you're either gonna wind up dead or in the penitentiary
'cause eventually you'll end up clenchin' a tool
and come back vengefully to shoot them bullies who clowned you in elementary school"
yeah, my head, something's wrong with it (yeah)
but that makes me me, i'm different (yup)
that lyrical phenom misfit
since i was a bleach blond, you hear the beat on this
which makes me only think of demonic shit (what?)
i was knockin' at death's door (yep), i fuckin' ding-dong ditched it (haha, yeah)
yeah, and i don't do that sing-song bitch shit (yeah)
and i don't use auto-tune, all i do is spit, and this shit just bothers you
call it quits, bitch, impossible
my pen just popped your thought balloon
you dipshits know how i'ma do it
send the motherfucking beat to the trauma-unit
yeah, shady records, look at all these squad killers we brought with us
juggernauts and godzillas, you don't rock with us, you're off of your rockers
bitch, back's to the wall as it always is
why i'm not talkin' about wallets and knots
when i say that the wall it is not against
it's more like the cross (cross), look at how far this is past you
regardless, you want me to reach a fuckin' bar that does not exist
no pun intended, but grip, hold on to this moment
'cause soon as you reach the top, they're gonna want you to fall from it (yeah)
so you better grab your seatbelt like i did mine, and fasten yours
like a motherfucking plane-crash passenger
'cause one day, you'll be crashing back to earth
and if you don't ever stop to smell the roses
i do know one thing, that's for sure
you don't get your flowers 'til you're pushin' up daisies (no)
and that's about all your ashes earn
