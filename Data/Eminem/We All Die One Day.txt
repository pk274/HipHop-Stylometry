'cause we gon' bring it to anybody who want it
you want it, you gon' get it
name 'em we gon' hit 'em chew 'em up and spit 'em out
too much venom and if you roll with 'em
we gon' fuck you up with 'em
i got too much momentum moving in my direction to lose
my shoes will explode as soon as you go to step in them, (boom)
you know how we do it when we do
how we do it when we come through
g-unit, d-1-2 and obie we all move like assassins
ski mask and gloves consider this as a warning
disaster comes faster than you can react to it, just ask muggs
but we are fizz-ast, fuck your little bitch ass up
we are not killers, my vato will have you shot, though
dragged through the barrio and fucked like kim osorio's
little sorry ho ass, go ask b-real
we burn source covers like fucking cypress hill (break it down!)
did in the '90s, when you was in diapers still
shady records, you better believe the hype is real
this is no joke, i don't smoke
but i toke enough secondhand to make my fucking p.o. choke (yeah!)
i'm an og, you're fucking with a g.i. joe
bia bia, mira mio la vida loc'
i'm a psycho, mariah ain't got shit on me
when i retire i'll be spitting baby food on people
at san ysidro ranch huddled up next to her
with hello kitty slippers on, humping her legs
you ever had your cap peeled back or your shit pushed in?
i put my blade in you like a fucking pin cushion
slice your ear clear off, smirnoff and hen, dog
i'll show you how to kill a fucking man like sen dog
(bring it, bring it, bring it back!)
nobody told you that i'm loco, Ã©se?
i lack every sane chemical in my membrane
i'm slim sha-d and the 'd' is for deez nuts
and you can get each one for free so feast up (uh-huh!)
i'll pee in a cup for three months
i'm having an e party for easter please come
'cause we gon'
