we just came to party
we ain't come in here to start shit with nobody
girl, we just wanna see you work that, work that body
with your man lookin' like he could murk somebody

he done tripped into this cup and spilled it on me
now he’s starting to talk shit to swift and naunie
he’s about to get the shit kicked in, stomped out of him
