my smith and wessy got you layin' in some alley messy
got your family lookin' for your ass on sally jessy
we squash beef in the mo', when you ain't breathin' no more
leavin' your skull split like steven seagal
let the cat out, flat out, detroit's a madhouse
so i don't get offended when i hear my city badmouthed
we quick to pull the gat out and set it
and leave you with more shit missin' than a lil' kim radio edit
stick up kids be tryin' to live paid
you get your crib sprayed with twenty-seven bullets in your rib cage
get the gauge, cock it back, empty your pockets, jack
or i'ma send you flyin' like a rocketpack
murder you for a bag of chips and a chocolate snack
break into your crib, steal your shit and lock it back
ten-year-old kids be standin' on the block with gats
just for livin' nowadays'll get you flocked with bats
where i'm from, you know what i'm sayin'?
that's some old detroit shit
y'all wouldn't know about that shit, though
'less you come to my city, you know what i'm sayin'?
see where we live
'cause we shine
