welcome to d-block, city of broke down dreams
where things ain't always peachy keen as they seem
city of dope dealers, killers, pimps, pushers
panhandlers, hustlers and doped out fiends
the sun don't shine here, in this part of town
but we all got a town that's similar to this too
they say every city's got a ghetto, every ghetto's got a hood
take a good look around you 'cause there's a d-block near you

welcome to d-block, the mighty, mighty d-block
the place in new york city where diddy won't even walk
its d-block, the part of yonkers i wouldn't be caught
without two pistols on me that'll be cocked in each pocket
d-block don't even stop to talk, you just keep walking
stick up kids every block who watch for every opportunity
as soon as you leave out that jewelry shop
and you won't even notice your mind will be so
preoccupied with that new watch you just copped
you won't even see that ride pulling up alongside you
you'll be shot 'fore you even realize you were spied on for three blocks
d-block the place where o.g.'s get knocked, locked up
get out, come home for a week and get re-knocked
you won't even see cops, hip-hop police don't even stop
on d-block, where everybody wants to be 'pac
and you can get popped over the new g-unit reeboks
