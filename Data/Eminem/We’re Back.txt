nothin' can stop and nothin' can change it
you better just make new livin' arrangements
if you think you the top and king of the castle
you about to be thrown off the throne and ripped a new asshole
all i hear is i'm best at this and i'm best at that
but i don't hear my name, no, ne'er brought up in rap
and i don't usually trip or dare get caught up in that
but when they say, "one of the best", i'm nowhere thought of as that
not even the same league as jay-z, nas, pac
biggie, or maybe they'll name me somewhere down at the bottom
right after az, or say "he
ripped that biggie verse, or that jay-z"
"yo, his verses were crazy, on that 'renegade', b!
but i ain't never bought no whole cd of shady
and all i hear is pop tunes come on the radi-
-o, and they play 'em twenty times in a row daily"
and that very well maybe the same reason they don't say me
when they speak on hip-hop legends, which has amazed me
'cause i thought the formula was to hit mainstream
and make it big-b-big-big-baby-ba ba-baby


hahahaha-hahaha! *pbbbbbbt* (what?)
