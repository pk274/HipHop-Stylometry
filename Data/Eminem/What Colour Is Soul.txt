shit, there ain't idiots bad as the fattest skinniest
sick with a little rapper to never battle, little, piddle or paddle the prettiest
dumb fuck, lookin' for the hats or suck a numb
or jackin' jeans keep your hangin' nuts tucked
and i'm about to take my look up it, up in a book
plus i'm almost on the top of the booty pull that coppin' a district shit
see you're just barkin' up the wrong tree
'cause i got diarrhea, myamia, i uh be a fuckin' honkey
so bad on the mic gotta make ya titterid kid retell what the fuck i'm saying
he just talk, but never the type babbadababa dangididangdang they think they shits so poppa hipty
i'd imagine if i were to put up a zipper to the mic i'd be able to do a lip-sync
because i rap in this muthafucker there's gotta be a certain rhyme this microphone stick, what the fuck i'll hoist it around inside my home
and the dj better stick up like a rocket
'cause he could scratch on a fucked up a pool table with 27 pockets
buttafingaz scratches like a girly fight
but if our color matters, take no less than pearly whites
but iâ€™m hardcore like rocks in a tomato
gettin' skinned like i was boxing a potato
i wouldn't suck on the mic if it was shaped like a nipple
i done made lots'a money so i'm good if i make like a nickel
but i'm out cold like a snowstorm
so i got nuts so fat, it'll keep my toes warm
(hit)
