if i were to die, murdered in cold blood tomorrow
would you feel sorrow, show love, or would it matter?
could never be the lead-off batter
if there ain't shit for me to feed off, i'm see-saw battlin'
but there's way too much at stake for me to be fake
there's too much on my plate
i done came way too far in this game to turn and walk away
and not say what i got to say
what the fuck you take me for, a joke? you smokin' crack?
'fore i do that, i'd beg mariah to take me back
i'll get up 'fore i get down, run myself in the ground
'fore i put some wack shit out
i'm tryna smack this one out the park, five-thousand mark
y'all steady tryna drown a shark
ain't gon' do nothin' but piss me off
lid to the can of whip-ass, just twist me off
see me leap out, pull a piece out
fuck shootin', i'm just tryna knock his teeth out
fuck with me now, bitch, let's see you freestyle
talk is cheap
motherfucker, if you really feelin' froggish, leap
"yo, slim, you gon' let him get away with that?
he tried to play you, you can't let him escape with that"
man, i hate this crap
this ain't rap, this is crazy, the way we act
when we confuse hip-hop with real life when the music stops
