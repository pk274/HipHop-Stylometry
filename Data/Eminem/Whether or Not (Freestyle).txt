we interrupt your little world of perfectness
to bring you the shit to murder conservatives with
to curse and diss, with verses so merciless
these words can just fuck up your high worse than this
{police sirens}
i've killed for less, and dumped bodies in the motherfuckin' wilderness
i'm a wildebeest, and i've concealed a piece even after i was busted by warren police
you think just because i got caught by these cops once
i'm not gonna carry shotguns to blow your wigs back like hamburgers without any top buns
so many damn murders i can't even count one
two black guns, i don't know maybe they're magnums
i don't know what the fuck they're called, i just grab them
12-gauge dumps in a drug-fueled rage, fuck age, still goin' through my "fuck-you" stage
i'm a 27-year-old eleven-year-old, i'mma never grow up, bitch, i ain't gon' ever get old
i'll be sitting here with a cane and a beard
still insane and as weird as the day i came in here, brain in my rear, yeah
so until i'm wrinkled as robert van winkle, i'mma drop a damn single every goddamn week, people
it's d12, june 19th, so do like me, and go buy three, with no id
