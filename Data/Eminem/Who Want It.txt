yeah, we back baby!
(yea, let's go!)
i told y'all we was comin' back
(we done time!)
detroit
what, bitch?
it's trick-trick!
(yeah!)
and motherfuckin' slim shady! (hahahahahaaa!)
(what?)
gettin' back, yo!
get your motherfuckin' hands up!


ooh, wow, look at the bitches up in this club
man i'm gettin' me some digits 'fore i leave up out this mug
and it's like boom pow, wham, bam, thank you ma'am
i ain't kissin' you on the lips but i'll be glad to shake your hand
now let's get blew out, let's start some shit tonight
just let me pick the chick that i'ma leave here with tonight 'fore we get to fightin'
and threw out, this music makes me rowdy
how they gonna play that new trick-trick and expect no one to get their shit split?
it's just too wild, and one more shot of hpnotiq
and i am not in control of my body, i go robotic
and blow a fuse out, homies is like, "you're startin' to stagger"
and i'm like, "nah that's just my swagger" and i'm dancin' with this fat girl
and gettin' loose now, i don't wanna fight, i feel like partyin'
'til this idiot dumps his bacardi on my cardigan
and knocks my screws out, it never fails, i know i'm goin' to jail
i might as well take the laces out my shoes now
