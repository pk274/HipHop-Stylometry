my words are weapons
i use 'em to crush my opponents
my words are weapons
i never show no emotion
my words are weapons
i use 'em to kill whoever's steppin' to me
my words are like weaponry on a record
my words are weapons
i use 'em to crush my opponents
these words are weapons
i never show no emotion
my words are weapons
i use 'em to kill whoever's steppin' to me
my words are like weaponry on a record


the rage i release on a page
is like a demon unleashin' a caged
lunatic as soon as i hit the stage
my mind is like a fuckin' stick of dynamite
once i get behind the mic
it's like the wick is lit, you bitches die tonight
my 9 is like a guidin' light at night: shinin' bright
my fuckin' grip is tighter than my wife's vagina (psych!)
these cock-suckin' cops got my smith-n-wesson
i guess it's time to pick a different weapon
man, the shit's depressin'
but swift is gettin' me a new one for a christmas present
come on, slim, let's go and teach this fuckin' bitch a lesson!
they managed to confiscate the pistol that i brandish
but my plan is to use this bullshit to my advantage
shady, stay creative, baby
hold your head up, don't you let up
one bit on these motherfuckin' suckers
you're a soldier, get up!
stand up for what you believe in, long as you breathin'
they jealous of you, man, that's the only reason they beefin'
