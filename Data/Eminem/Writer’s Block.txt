i can’t, i can’t think of nothin'
i’m stumped, here we go!
on your feet! stand up! everybody hands up!
uh, man, i don't know man
every time i go to think of something played out to say
you already said it


'cause sometimes i feel like it's so hard for me
to come up with shit to say, ayy
i'm at a loss for words, 'cause y'all already said it all
i think i'm runnin' outta clichés
i'm gettin' writers block, psyche!
