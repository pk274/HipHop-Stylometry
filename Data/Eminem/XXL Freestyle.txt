hand me an eighth, beam me up and land me in space
i'mma' sit on top of the world and spit on brandy and ma$e
i'm more than ill
scarier than a white person trapped in a room with lauryn hill
human horror film
but with a lot funnier plot, and people that feel me
cause i'mma' still be the madd rapper
whether i got money or not
as long as i'm on pills, and i got plenty of pot
i'll be in a canoe paddlin', makin' fun of your yacht
but i would like an award
for the best rapper to get one mic in the source
and a wardrobe i can afford
otherwise i might just end up back striking at ford
and you wonder what the hell i need more vicodin for?
everybody's pissin' me off; even the no limit tank
looks like a middle finger sideways flippin' me off
no shit i'm a great danger to my health
why else would i kill you then jump in a grave and bury myself?


ight, yo
where the fuck y'all at, nigga?
