when me and fif' got together to do this music
the more we became enveloped
we just developed a fellowship through it
it's no pretend shit, it's friendship, mi nemesis es su nemesis
same for him, it's just media, see to them it's just images
but this shit is no gimmicks, this is blood in and blood out
when it's beef you just gotta know when to butt in and butt out
if there's a problem we solve it, if we don't resolve it
it usually just evolves into one big brawl
and we all get involved in it
and we should all get a merit, this much beef we inherit
and wear it like a badge of honor, pass it around and share it
and let it go to whoever's holdin'
the most current beef on their shoulders
and their soldiers got their backs 'til it's over
but tonight, we ain't come in here to beef with nobody
we came to party: banks, ca$his, and mr. ferrari
so it's shady, aftermizath, back in that ass, you izzask?
come izzon, what kinda fizzuckin' quizzestion is that?


who run it? you know, you actin' like you don't know
i tear the club up fo' sho'
this flow is gon' bring mo' dough
yeah, you know, but you actin' like you don't know
who run it? i said, you know but you actin' like you don't know
i tear the club up fo' sho'
this flow is gon' bring mo' dough
yeah, you know, but you actin' like you don't know
