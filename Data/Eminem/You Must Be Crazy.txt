i'm keeping it raw
illegal like malik and jamal
cause i don't believe in the law
like i'm steven seagal
flipping off the police while i'm leaping the wall
take some tylenol then fall asleep in the mall
got your little son, you'll be receiving a call
you're lucky this little punk's still breathing at all
fuck the world, this is how i get even at y'all
popped sick and rolled up, and leave in the vault
i'll hit you in the mouth and stick your teeth in your jaw
you won't be able to eat shit, not even a malt
it's lethal assault
it's giving you a reason to stall
cocking this deuce deuce and i'm squeezing it off
at the first burp and a fart
a sniffle, a sneeze, and a cough
get your arm chewed off
like you was teasing a dog
i'm cold enough and hot enough to freeze and then thaw
i kicked my girl out in ten degrees in a bra
you faggots turn yellow like the trees in the fall
i'm shitting on rappers
"where's shady?"
he's in the stall
all that's left of your niece is a piece of her doll
and all that's left of her puppy is a leash and a paw
motherfucker
