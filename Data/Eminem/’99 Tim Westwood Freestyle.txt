blastin' off (aw yeah!)
yo, i'm sayin' though
you understand what's going on right now, london?
one two, one two, one two (yeah)
one two, one two, one two (one two)
y'all done started something that you can't undo (what?)
yo, yo (a one-one-one two)


i'm up in the spot with tim westwood
you wanna step to this? you better use your best foot
flawless freestyles i drop right off the top (yeah)
take a bottle of beer and bite off the top (yeah)
right of the block, straight to your neighborhood (what?)
the flavor's good in london and i'ma stay for good (ha!)
yo, check it out, it's slim shady
i rip the radio right off of the s baby (yeah)
y'all can't see me 'cause y'all don't wanna even be it
y'all don't understand these freestyles when i mc it (yeah)
original bad boy on the case, cover your face
came in the place, blowed and sprayed puffy with mace (what)
i lace the weed with insect repellent, better check to smell it
eminem starts with e, better check to spell it
with a capital, somebody grab me a snapple
i got an aspirin capsule trapped on my adam's apple
somebody dropped me on my head and i'm for sure
that my mother did it, but the bitch won't admit it was her
i slit her stomach open with a scalpel when she was 6 months
and said i'm ready now bitch, ain't you feelin' these kicks, cunt?
the world ain't ready for me yet, i can tell
i'll probably have a cell next to the furnace in hell
i'm sicker than sperm cells with syphilis germs
and i'm hotter than my dick is, when i piss and it burns (yeah)
i kick you in the tummy until you're sick to your stomach
and vomit so much blood that your clothes stick to you from it
hit you in the head with a brick 'til you plummet
if y'all don't like me, you can suck my dick 'til you numb it (what?)
and all the gibberish you was spittin', you need to kill it
'cause your style is like dyin' in my sleep, i don't feel it (yeah)
and any mc that try to step to this i'll throw you right off of the roof
ayo, bust it, proof!


hey listen
one of a kind and i come with the time
havin' fun with the rhyme until i'm done with your mind
listen, now every mc got a story
well, mine is me and my story hasn't involved me before me
i'm sorry too when my style to be proved
ayo since big daddy kane fell off they don't know how to be smooth
yo, i seen a fat rodent walk in with paul rosen
with a gat in holdin', talkin' 'bout he deshaun holton
it's the same thing, we bust when it come through
with tim westwood, your best foot forward
can't do that, here it is, put your good foot
we mack y'all, like y'all was some hoes on wood wood
no time for that, flatbacks when you rap, counterattack
with a battle axe, you collapse from them whack raps
you try to spit to me, i make you all know i'm a genius
if i hear hyenas
come back holdin' myâ€•yo, no need to cuss, bust (penis!)
yo we can't say that keep it the cleanest, the meanest
slim shady, next single was "my fault"
y'all caught outlined in chalk, incredible as the hulk
while i settle for swart, it's the p-r-letter o
sex is hetero, cash more checks than federal, you better know
how you feel about they got a dope cheddar flow
and my man dee teezy, straight from stress magazine
bag a scene, we drag your queen
like she's a man dressed up, how you feel you get pressed up
left up, it's time for that p-r-o-o, you get f'd up
yeah it's time for that mind combat
next up my man slim shade when we rhyme at


last night i od'd on rush, mushrooms and dust
and got rushed to the hospital to get my system flushed (what)
shucks, i'm an alcoholic and that's all i can say
i've called in to work 'cause all i do is frolic and play
i swallow grenades and take about a bottle a day
of tylenol 3 and talk about how violent i'll be (yeah)
give me 11 excedrin and my head'll spin
medicine'll get me revvin' like a 747 jet engine (woo)
scratched my balls 'til i shred the skin
doctor check this rash, look how red it's been
it's probably aids, forget it then (ha ha)
i'll strike a still pose and hit you with some ill flows
that don't even make sense like dykes usin' dildos
so reach in your bill folds for 10 duckets
and pick up the slim shady stuff that's on rawkus (yeah)
somethin' somethin' somethin' somethin', i can't read it (i got your back)
my daughter scribbled over that rhyme, i couldn't read it (i got your back)


aight, aight
yo, yo yo (yeah)
one more time i come back
slingin' the wack, yo
i'm the illest rapper to hold a cordless, patrollin' corners
lookin' for hookers to punch in the mouth for a roll of quarters (woo)
i'm meaner in action than roscoe beatin' james todd senior
and smackin' his back with vacuum cleaner attachments
i grew up in the wild hood, as a hazardous youth
with a messed up childhood, that i use as an excuse
and ain't nothin' changed, i kept the same mind state
since the third time that i failed 9th grade
you'll probably think that i'm a negative person, don't be so sure of it
i don't promote violence, i just encourage it (yeah)
i laugh at the sight of death as i fall down a cement flight of steps
and land inside a bed of spider webs
so throw caution to the wind, you and a friend
can jump off of a bridge and if you live, do it again
pfft, why not? blow your brain out, i'm blowin' mine out
forget it, you only live once you might as well die now


smokin' herb and still we spit
on this microphone, they say i'm allowed to say, "shit"
so i'ma say it as much as i can
'cause it don't matter 'cause i'm the man
with a frickin' beer in my hand
i said, "frick" 'cause i was respectin' tim westwood
y'all wanna step to this, yo i come from the best hood
detroit, the motown, where it goes down
kick the flow sound, rappers they know now
but kick a pro now


and 3 plus, y'all wanna be us
but none of y'all can see us (what)
even if y'all had some new bifocals, i try locals
so y'all die roiled locals 'cause i smoked you (yeah)
plus i provoke you and then i bust
freestyles y'all can't trust, i'm like canibus (yeah)
i bust, can i bust? no, you can't
well, yes i can 'cause i'm slim shady and i'm the man


well, i'ma check then with dirty needles
it's two of us but we're not the beatles
'cause there was three of them, and i am seein' them
but y'all ain't seein' em even if i was drivin' in the bm in the pm
with the top up and the top down, don't matter 'cause i rock now
yo, y'all can hear the glock sound, 2pac now
yo, that's what i am when i bust, this lyrical image
y'all can't just betray the scrimmage
that i be killin' when i be bustin' and i'm crushin'
any mc leave 'em with no freakin' discussion


weed lacer, ninety-seven burgundy blazer
wanted for burglary, had to ditch the mercury tracer
i'm on some loc' shit, some fed up with this bein' broke shit (yeah)
i'm not to joke with, yo, i don't sell crack, i smoke it


hand me an .8, beam me up and land me in space
i'ma sit on top of the world and spit on brandy and ma$e
i'm more than ill, scarier than a white person
trapped in a room with lauryn hill, human horror film
but with a lot funnier plot, and people that feel me
'cause i'ma still be madd rapper, whether i got money or not
as long as i'm on pills, and i got plenty of pot
i'll be in a canoe paddlin', makin' fun of your yacht
but i would like an award
for the best rapper to get one mic in the source
and a wardrobe i can afford
otherwise i might just end up back-strikin' a ford
and you wonder what the hell i need more vicodin for
everybody's pissin' me off; even the no limit tank
looks like a middle finger sideways flippin' me off
no duh i'm a great danger to my health
why else would i kill you then jump in the grave and bury myself?
you can hate me now


flows are hmm delly-lah like arabian! (*proof mimicking arabian speech*)
ayo, ayo
we don't wanna hear that best white rapper
we be talkin' 'bout best rapper
forget all that, you know what i'm sayin' ?
no doubt, no doubt, never
blastin' off
explosions left and right (left and right)
