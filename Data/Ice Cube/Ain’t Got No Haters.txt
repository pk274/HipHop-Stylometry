sorry, y'all, i ain't got no haters
everybody love black ass darth vader
you and your woman love to see me comin'
come through bumpin', little kids runnin'
chasin' me down like the ice cream truck
these police, they never light me up
i'm that nigga, baby, hype me up
fuckin' up at work, they never write me up
they always hold me down and raise me up
and all these women wanna glaze me up
never turnt down, i'm turnt up
you heard me, bitch, i said, "i'm turnt up"
always on ten, always too loud
always too hard for this boujee ass crowd
even these haters, they love my style
so, i don't know what you talkin' about


sorry, y'all, i ain't got no haters
all i got is motherfuckin' players
we get money in motherfuckin' layers
sorry, y'all, i ain't got no haters
sorry, y'all, i ain't got no haters

jackpot, think i'm in the crack spot? you a crackpot
i'm a slip knot and i'ma get hot
and i'ma stay hot so take a backseat, nigga, maybach
boy, do what i say, nigga, robot
you kinda hit and miss, i'm the sure shot
never sold out, niggas bought out
you won't survive the fallout when i go all out
michael ball out but never touch no balls
i ain't a athlete, i can't take no loss
all i know is champagne in my eyes
all this hate is what i don't recognize
all i know is that l-o-v-e
they beg me to drink a forty of o-e
low key, bump like a oldie
niggas treat me better than kobe
