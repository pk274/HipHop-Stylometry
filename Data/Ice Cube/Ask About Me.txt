check my blood pressure
they think they fresher than the don
prescription pills to keep me calm
nigga, i'm da bomb!
in the black testerosa
sippin' on mimosa
i plead no sir
i'm in the west wing at the nikko
give me cinco kilos from puerto rico
when i okay it
so much cheese, you got to weigh it
never thought these niggas was the feds
"freeze" was the sound
i started lettin' off rounds
lay the whole fuckin' room down
i don't wanna see your honor
ratha eat piranha from benihana
smokin' marijuana in my sauna
i done had it with these addicts and faggots
they done ratted causin' static
bring me my a-u-t-o-matic
oh niggas wanna se how we ride
bitch, you know the muthafuckin' side
world muthafuckin' wide


make yo' hustle official
and them niggas that's wit' you
gotta push tha issue
on the fools that dis you
whether pump or pistol
when it's up in yo' gristle
hand yo' mama a tissue
if i decide to kiss you


can you dig her?
it's the bigger, seven-figure, super nigga
wit' the triggas at yo' dome
we like to roam
through yo' muthafuckin' home like a comb
and find the money that's gone
and we'll take you, shake you
break you, make you take two
to your own with the chrome
nigga shoot!
execute, they try to electrocute
i got too much loot
ya say i'm on yo' hit list
you niggas miss
tryin' to turn my muthafuckin' cheese into swiss
rappers make bucks and i can hear it
hard to fear it
'cuz i know you grew up on my lyrics
it's the boss player
never lost hair over assholes
blast holes in you muthafuckin' tadpoles
like a bullfrog
nigga i'm a bullhog
guppies get worked like puppies by the bulldog
where millions never gave a fuck about sicilians
or killas on t.v. can see
we got the real ones
so check yo' muthafuckin cd-rom
and your world wide web, dot com
it's the don mega!


make yo' hustle official
and them niggas that's wit' you
gotta push tha issue
on the fools that dis you
whether pump or pistol
when it's up in yo' gristle
hand yo' mama a tissue
if i decide to kiss you
