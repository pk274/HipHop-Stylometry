i'm a blackboy and always gettin' underestimated
but when i move next door, i know you hate it
you had my whole family investigated
and when they didn't find no crack, you said i ate it
uh-uh, a motherfucker just elevated
over ghetto life that was designated
you see this blackboy, you know heaven made it
i don't want to go if i got to integrate it
little colored boy, be happy you made it
just take what you got and stop complainin'
ok, weather man will stop the rainin'
on my people head, and start explainin'
what your people said, believe in the bible
but you still act barbaric and psycho
my name is ice cube, bitch, it ain't michael
i'll never bleach my own skin just to be like you
