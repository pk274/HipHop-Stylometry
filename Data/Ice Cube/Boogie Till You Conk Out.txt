to all the ladies, to all the ladies
from the 80's, up in vegas
to all the ladies from 90's
you can find me wherever i be
i'm still gonna flow 2010
still gotta about two thousand to spend
haters in the place can't erase my grin
stuck on my face when i'm with my friends
when i bust a rap to a dj quik beat
we get green just like bill bixby
turn into a beast and you a beauty
know i'm a player, will you recruit me?
i got game, and you got to tailgate
let's have a party, girl why the hell wait
let's have a ball, get her up from the table
if she don't wanna dance find one that say...
