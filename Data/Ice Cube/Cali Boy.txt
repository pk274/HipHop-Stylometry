i stay green like that green
purple like that purple
before i start rappin' mc's look like urkel
with funny-ass haircuts and tight-ass clothes
no 64's, the game was exposed
i had to come through like darth vader wit' activator, in all black, a nigga act like the raiders
now you know why i rap like blow fly
cuz' i'm a c-a-l-i b-o-y
so fly, i do this shit for life
don't lie, a nigga is a soldier
i told ya, this right hand will fold ya
this california cobra ain't never ever sober
no testarossa, west coastra nostra
black and brown stay down like we suppose to
it's the governor, laugh now cry later, if i ran bitch i can be schwarzenegger
(ice cube)
