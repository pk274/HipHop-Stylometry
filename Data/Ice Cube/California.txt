we from the east side
oakland, california, that's how we ride (oh, god)
we don't know you, nigga, where you from?
you lookin' over here, but y'all don't want none
we make the homicide rate go up every year (oh, god)
if you a bad motherfucker, you can make it here
and we ain't throwin' no signs (oh, god), just a clip and a nine
one bullet to the head, put some shit on your mind
get busy, california grizzly
i'm rollin' hundreds, who rollin' with me?
yellow's the color of sun rays
harley-davidsons on sundays
so don't hate, i'm from the golden state
do a half-pike off the golden gate
will i live or die? ain't no tellin'
'fore i hit the water, you know what i'm yellin'
