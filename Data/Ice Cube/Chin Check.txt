i'm a nigga wit an attitude thanks to y'all
and i don't give a fuck i keep it gangsta, y'all
i'ma ride for my side in the cpt
god bless the memory of eazy-e
if it wasn't for me, where the fuck you'd be?
rapping like the treacherous three, you fucking cowards
i done seen dre rocking parties for hours
and i done seen ren fucking bitches from howard
and i done seen snoop give away a eddie bauer
so fuck jerry heller and the white superpowers
