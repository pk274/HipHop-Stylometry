oakland raiders, just win, baby
we are the oakland raiders, just win, baby
don't need no invitation
we are that raider nation
we rock that black and silver
we make 'em shake and shiver
we make 'em reconsider
and we still committed
so if you want a piece of this, you can come and get it


touchdown, touchdown
let's throw a bomb on first down
let's throw a bomb on every down
first we score, then we clown
having fun, look around
nobody loud as a raider crowd
nobody proud as a raider crowd
nfl, how you like me now?
we gon' do this oakland style
nothing but action, i'm bo jackson
hit the hole, run you over
goal line, jumpin' over
going crazy, lose your soul
lose your mind, in a black hole
here's the goal: superbowl
and everybody here get the gold
