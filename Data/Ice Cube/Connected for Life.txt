twenty-inchers roll, go and get these hoes
picky hoes wanna roll with my niggaroles
but be a freak about it, and i'ma see about it
speak about it, no, bitch, i'ma be about it
who want some of this? west runnin’ this
mack 10 with the playboy bunny bitch
she's a dummy bitch with a money pit
you broke-ass niggas can't even stomach this


to all the bitches that think they bootylicious
i think they nutritious, i think they do dishes
i'm makin’ three wishes, or takin' they pictures
and spendin' they riches and fuckin' they bitches
egomaniac, little homies call me brainiac
ice cube's an asshole and it ain't an act
so take a hit of that, and remember that
where my motherfuckin’ niggas and my bitches at?
