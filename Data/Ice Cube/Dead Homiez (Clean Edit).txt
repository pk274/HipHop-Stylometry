up early in the morning, dressed in black
don't ask why, 'cause i'm down in a suit and tie
they killed a homie that i went to school with (damn)
i tell you life ain't nothin' to fool with
i still hear the screams of his mother
while my man laid dead in the gutter
and it's getting to my temple
why is that the only time black folks get to ride in a limo?
it makes me so mad i wanna get scandalous (yeah)
and go handle it
but no, i pay my respects and i'm through
hug my crew (what up, loc?), and maybe shed a tear or two
and i wanna get blitz
grab my forty ounce and then i reminisce
about a brother who had to be the one and only
so i dedicate this to my dead homiez


another homie got murdered on a shakedown (damn)
and his mother is at the funeral, havin' a nervous breakdown
two shots hit him in the face when they blasted
a framed picture, and a closed casket
a single file line about fifty cars long
all drivin' slow with they lights on
he got a lot of flowers and a big wreath
what good is that when you're six feet deep?
i look at the drama, and gotta think to myself
and thank god for my health
'cause nobody really ever know
when it's gonna be they family on the front row
so i take everything slow, go with the flow
and keep my mouth shut if i don't know (word!)
'cause that's what pops told me
but i wish he could have said it...to my dead homiez


yo, i remember we painted our names on the wall for fun
now it's "rest in peace" after every one (damn)
except me, but i ain't the one to front
seems like i'm viewin' a body after every month
plus, i knew him when he was yay big
pour my beer on the curb before i take a swig
but somethin' ain't right
when there's a tragedy, that's the only time that the family's tight
lovin' each other in a caring mood
there's lots of people and lots of food
they say "be strong" and you're tryin'
how strong can you be when you see your pops cryin'?
so that's why ice cube's dressed up
because the city is so damn messed up
and everybody is so phony
take a little time...to think about your dead homiez


this is dedicated to all my muthaf---in' homiez
