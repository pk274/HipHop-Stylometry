ain't no half-steppin'
when you tryna make a good impression
do your very best is the lesson
unless you all salad, no dressin'
i don't like shit half-done
from a job to a piece of filet mignon
you got to give a full effort
and pray to the shepherd you don't get shotgun peppered
keep your work and your play separate
you know you got a record and your past is kinda checkered
you gotta work double as hard to get half as far, as black as we are
i'm black as the tar, but i'm a star
i'm down as fuck and up to par (yeah)
i might cuss, yell or vent
but you know ice cube give a thousand percent
