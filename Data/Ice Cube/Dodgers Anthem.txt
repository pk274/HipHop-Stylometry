la dodgers, other say doodgers
win the world series, baby show your hooters!
this is for y’all that think we caught the vapors
no i’ve been down since fernando valenzuela
it's the young hog, yasiel puig
come to the plate, give the city what it need
tryin’ to make a scene at chavez ravine
one big swing to bring la the ring
bleed dodger blue, tommy lasorda
i think i saw an old man walking on water
hey y’all i’m on crenshaw with clayton kershaw
he got the cy young, who wanna playball
it got tragic, i called up magic
and everybody know that magic flip the cabbage
pop bubbly with vin scully so lovely, to win in 2013
