everybody, check your fuckin' cd-rom
triple-w dot com, it's the don
make it happen, super nigga, that's right
with a group of niggas (westside), we tight
universal, not commercial, no rehearsal
gotta search you, her, too, before we hurt you
i don't give a fuck where you grew, nigga
none of you niggas true to the w, nigga


goddammit, niggas take my planet for granted
you got to hand it, westside living's enchanted
so when you see ice cube and allfrumtha i
say your prayers 'cause you all finna die
it's the ghetto ayatollah, let me hold a motorola
i get an order, niggas killin' like he ebola
i'm solar, lookin' for you westside bar codes
or i'm sendin' niggas dumpin' by the car loads
