damn, i'm broke
my feet hurt
inside the mind of a car jacker
and that bitch is slipping
it makes me wanna creep
damn, it makes me wanna creep
i got something for your mind, your body and your soul
i got something for your mind, your body and your soul


damn, i'm such a g it's pathetic
here comes the big-headed
nigga that's dipping
sipping on courvoisier
goddamn i must have to floss today
now pimping ain't easy but it's necessary
so i'm chasing bitches like tom chased jerry
i'll put the pedal to the floor
in my two-tone ford explorer
you know how it's done
sounds bumping
ain't that something
jumped on the 110
she's flying in the blazer
like go speed racer
but i ain't gonna chase her
like racer x
but i won't flex
til it's time to have sex
so when you wanna get together
cause you know a nigga like me
is down for whatever
damn, and i'm down for whatever
damn


when i was little i didn't wanna be like mike
i wanted to be like ike, cause
papa was a rollin' stone in the sixties
and he liked green just like bill bixby
told me that my best friend was a ten and a twenty
pockets never skinny
played let's get it on in the living room
and when he got drunk, you'd better give him room
cause he'll turn the party out saying
"this is my muthafuckin house!"
and y'all gots to go through the door
and if you can't find the door
he'll help you with the four-four
talking much shit on the grass
and straight down to blast
i'm still in my pjs;
he's in a turtleneck sweater
and we down for whatever
and i'm down
solid pro is down for whatever
the don jagwarr is down for whatever
and it don't seem to stop


now, i don't talk a lot of shit
but when it's time to get busy with these hoes, let's go
cause i'd rather see a skinhead dead
then my niggas wearing blue or red
cause i got the gift
to hit these hoes swift
and i'm smelling like a fifth of something
yeah, that's right
i'm standing in the store
koreans act so nice
cause i got potentials to blow up a winchells
donut
and you know what
i'm cool like dat like digable planets
but don't take a nigga for granted
cause whether it's a verdict or the l.a. four
you just don't know
that this rapping-ass nigga will change with the weather
and be down for whatever
and i'm down


creep
and i'm down for whatever
bump it in your jeep
ice cube - d'voidofpop
and i will never dance for you trick-ass niggas
it makes me wanna creep
it makes me wanna creep
