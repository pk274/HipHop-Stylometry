yo, comin' at you with another funky st. ides commercial
ice cube and i got my gat
and it's still a man's world


sixteen men dead on a mothership
'cause they said that only a brother could sip
up st. ides malt liquor...
wait, wait, wait, yo-yo, i think your head's gettin' bigger
'cause i see you comin'
st. ides is strong enough for a man, and not for a woman
back up off my tip, to me, you're just shootin' your lip
ain't nothin' wrong with a woman taking a sip
haha, don't get me wrong, the drink is real strong
but it's cool and mellow when you're groovin' with your fellows
so ladies, while you're out there chillin' with your man
while he pop the 40, put a glass in your hand
slide me mine 'cause st. ides is right on time, yeah, haha


i told you it wouldn't be nothin' without a woman's touch, hahaha
or a big butt, haha
