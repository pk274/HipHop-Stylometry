come and hear the voice of the man they call the trojan horse
ride on the outside, with inner force
throw you off course, of course, you missed the runway
we mash, like the first kickoff, on a sunday
collisions, divisions of niggas, down to listen
and when we on the mission, call your mortician
join the party, i can provide the army
first we flank 'em then we spank 'em.. i outrank 'em
you can call me citizen kane for my reign
ten years straight, one of the ten great
mr. media, look inside your encyclopedia
2002, see ice cube
fuck a five-star, i'm a live star
what you got to die for? who you wanna ride for?
fuck dying! (fuck dying!)

don mega
don mega


it's the suspect king of the roughnecks, bonafide
worldwide, your highness, the finest
big as china, nigga rhymer, chart climber
quick to send a first-timer back to his aunt jemimah
physi-cal, nigga roll with the winners
after these dinners, go out and represent us
we got antennas, scanners and satellites
to see if you battle right, we got to bite
hold on tight, shake and pump venom
some haters don't learn till you leave lead in 'em
see the dead in 'em, rigor mortis spread in 'em
keep your mouth shut, motherfuckin' mouth slug
see these crossed legs, quick to cross feds
foe to mighty one, it's the mighty son
fuck dying, yeah
