consider this an invitation, to my gangsta nation


what the fuck is ice cube talkin' about?
that's how you get these nuts parked in you mouth
westside ride bitch, the same old shit
i don't conversate with pussy, i ain't gon get
i don't holla at these hoes that sing like ashanti
body like beyonce, face like andre (uhh)
bitch you kinda strangé
but i'm rich so my entré
got to be bombay


one thing i do know, i ain't the uno
big puno, rap sumo, on pruno (you know)
i'd like to thank the congregation
and my affiliation to the gangsta nation
i'm hard on them, yeah, i'm ruthless
you like a stick, pussy, nigga, you're useless
you know the side bitch, better get up on it
cause it must be a single with nate dogg singin' on it
