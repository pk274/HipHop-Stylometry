i'm gettin' dizzy as the world keeps spinnin' like a frisbee
gangstas and girls make the world twirl
no hesitation i can run a nation from incarceration
30 years is what i'm facin'
but give me 7 seas and 11 g's
i make enough cheese to bring wall street to its knees
nigga please i got enough guns
to fill the empire state building full of 1's
go to school is what you tell us
but niggas in school is scared of the goodfellas
we got the yayo you can just say no
but nobody makes a fuckin' move until i say so
that's how it is and that's how it's gonna be
kids when you grow up who the fuck you wanna be?
like me ya black superhero
got enough zeros to hire bob shapiro
ya honor i'mma have to get rid of ya
because it ain't no trivia about my flat in west bolivia!
i blew the jury a kiss they rather dismiss
than swim with the big fish
you fuckin' guppies!!!!!!!!
