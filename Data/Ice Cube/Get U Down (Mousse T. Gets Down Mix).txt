why the black and the brown got to fight in the pen?
the black and the brown, they squabbin' again
the motherfuckin' sheriff is laughin' again
that shit stink, keep your ass out the wind
see, the black and the brown, we can share the same land
when i was a slave, where the fuck did i ran?
california, man, it was full of mexicans
this is they shit, nigga, can't say shit
just, kick back and enjoy the sunshine
live your life, stay away from one-time
get you money, mayne, find the lunch line
this ain't a joke, nigga, where's the punchline?
the ghetto is a trap homie, take the cheese
soon as you do it, here come the police
invented and designed for us to fail
homie, don't you end up dead or in jail
