mama, can i go outside?
niggas havin' fun on that slip 'n slide (ghetto)
doin' acrobatics on the dirty mattress
i'm in the bathroom playin' with matches
auntie catch us, that's an ass-whoopin'
grandmama call her a fast woman (ghetto)
tappin' on that window pane
homegirl down the street give me brains
daddy come home with the doberman gang
out the back door, holdin' my chain (ghetto)
jumped off the roof, hit the pigeon coop
got another triple-double shootin' some hoop
ghetto motherfucker spittin' the truth
don't need a loop, don't need a booth (ghetto)
just beat on the table, lyrics are fatal
don't need a deal, don't need a label, hello
nigga ghetto, it's falsetto, yeah
'bout as black as a tea kettle (ghetto)
down to clap metal if you're yellow
tear it up, foot on the gas pedal
