(who the fuck is that?) it's ice cube, motherfucka
(he's a maniac) no i'm a fool, motherfucka
old school motherfucka, blow through a motherfucka
what you heard about a nigga so true, motherfucka
see i'm ugly and prettay, i'm polished and grittay
shoot better than that nigga that tried to kill 50
see, niggas get shittay when i come to their cittay
when i hit the spot that bitch they like â€” she comin' with me
'cause i got an ego big as t.o
but i'm not an eagle; bitch, i roll a regal
'cause gangstas don't dance, we boogie
i told you motherfuckas, kobe didn't take that pussy
get money, get paid, you can beat that shit
even if the d.a. is a piece'a shit
colorado got bravado, but eat that shit
another white bitch lyin' on the black dick
i keep it flippin' like flapjacks, pimpin' like black 'lacs
give niggas flashbacks, they sweaty as ass cracks
when i hit the tarmac, it feel like a carjack
niggas get out, and vanish like star trek
so fuckin' incredible, i'm so fuckin' credible
no matter what happen, i'll never turn federal
and that's my report comin' straight from cali
ice cube is the shit on this motherfuckin' grand finale
