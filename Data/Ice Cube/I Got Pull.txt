mount westmore is in the house, baby (yay-yay)
and we want y'all to know that we got pull (ayo, 40)
i mean that real pull
you know, the plug, the connect, baby


ice cube ain't a savage
boy, i'm a god, this black magic
you a facade, i'm back at it
you a mirage, i'm lookin' right at it
blap-blap-blat it, opps get splattered
must've didn't know that my life mattered
rap addict, nope, i ain't tatted
i don't advertise, i just mobilize
i help niggas realize
who they really are, make 'em feel high
i'm on my way to the bay
with bow-wow-wow yippee-yo yippee-yay, hey
$hort dog is on the hog
and none of us really give a fuck about the law
we'd rather give it to you raw
and if you don't like it, we'll give it to your jaw
