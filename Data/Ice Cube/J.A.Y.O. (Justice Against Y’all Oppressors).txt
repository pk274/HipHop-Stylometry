uh, uh, uh, uh
ice cube forever, bigger and deffer
fuck the oppressor
possessor of a mini 14 behind my dresser
faze one, blaze one, the representation of my nation
it's jay one on the spray gun springing leaks
in your physique, got nines on you as we speak
laughin' loud as we eat
you fucking geek in a wire
test the fire attire
that ass, go through the broken glass
niggas mash and ask, i'm the last emporer
the temperature, heated, remain undefeated
we waited, we greeted by the motherfuckin' law
in the south they say "get out the fuckin' car"
it's raw, e-40's lyrics fuckin' caviar
i believe these dirty pigs know who we are
if they pull somethin' start dumpin'
don't say nothin'
and if they show it on real t.v., my niggas love it
