the west coast warlord
the grand wizard
ice cube
motherfucking head so big
they call him jack 'n the box


(hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey)
(tha bizness)
yeah, yeah
i'm a superhero, like lou ferrigno
made bob de niro, look like a zero
shine the spotlight, this is my night
get your cameras ready, let it rain confetti
i'm a champion, i do what can't be done
in the real league nerd not the fantasy one
throw your hands up, you can cheer for your boy
when i hit the stage get a ear full of noise
when i bring the noise from here to illinois
motherfuckers love when i do what it does
a all-star, superstar entertainer
world-class, first ballot hall of famer
some rappers claim that they got a heart full of anger
how when your lyrics were written by a stranger?
fool, i'm the greatest, you just the latest
i'm loved by your grandmama, and your babies


see my head is so big they call me jack 'n the box
you can't impress me, so fuck what you got
i say my head is so big they call me jack 'n the box
don't talk about money 'cause i'm stacking a lot


shine that light on me, put that light on me
'cause i was sent to the world, by g-o-d
shine that light on me, put that light on me
'cause i was sent to the world, by g-o-d


(hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey)


i was a born loser, i was a born sinner
now i am a winner, in the convention center
i got to take a bow, 'cause i still wonder how
the system didn't get me when i was a juvenile (just think)
just think if i had got locked up
no "boyz n tha hood" thanks to america
no eazy, n.w.a, no "friday"
don't let ya motherfucking talent go to waste
don't catch a case 'cause these people got a place
to throw your life away and take you right out the waste
throw your hands up, you got to man up
i had to show the world, what i was made of
what you say blood, i was a slave cuz
now i'm vip, up in vegas
i'm up in nike town, so how you like me now
see the whole industry had to bite my style


see my head is so big they call me jack 'n the box
i knew we would win, so i'm bragging a lot
i say my head is so big they call me jack 'n the box
my shit is so dope, it's like crack in the pot


shine that light on me, put that light on me
'cause i was sent to the world, by g-o-d
shine that light on me, put that light on me
'cause i was sent to the world, by g-o-d


now mama don't be mad, i got to show my ass
and thank these motherfuckers for my past
i got to let them know i never break like glass (never)
what you looking at is top notch world-class
now mama don't be mad, i got to show my ass
and thank these motherfuckers for my past
i got to let them know i never break like glass (never)
what you looking at is top notch world-class


see my head is so big they call me jack 'n the box
you can't impress me, so fuck what you got
i say my head is so big they call me jack 'n the box
