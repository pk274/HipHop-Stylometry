gimme that brew, fool, it's a full-time jack move
st. ides malt liquor make the black move
and i'd tell any tom, dick and hank
who bought 8 ball, "you got ganked"
go with the black, not the copper
'cause the s-t crooked i is so proper
with the l-e-n-c-h m-o-b
plus a tall can and a 40
and here's how we'll greet ya
pass you a brew first time we meet ya
you'll feel dumb 'cause you didn't know
ice cube don't drink that other beer no mo'
drink some and you won't change back
you'll say, "i ain't never drunk a beer like that"
off the end of the bottle, you choke
short dog's in the house â€” "yo, pass the dro!"
and if you wanna come up
pull to the store, get out and then run up
go to the counter with your five
and buy a 40 of the st. ides
