just wakin' up in the morning, gotta thank god
i don't know, but today seems kinda odd
no barking from the dog, no smog
and momma cooked a breakfast with no hog
i got my grub on but didn't pig out
finally got a call from a girl i wanna dig out
hooked it up for later as i hit the door
thinkin', "will i live another twenty-four?"

i gotta go 'cause i got me a drop-top
and if i hit the switch, i can make the ass drop
had to stop at a red light
lookin' in my mirror and not a jacker in sight
and everything is alright

i got a beep from kim, and she can do itall night
called up the homies and i'm askin' y'all
"which park are y'all playin' basketball?"

get me on the court and i'm trouble
last week, messed around and got a triple-double
freakin' brothers every way, like mj
i can't believe today was a good day


i can't believe today was a good day

a good day
a good day
a good day
i can't believe today was a good day

a good day
a good day
a good day


drove to the pad and hit the showers
didn't even get no static from the cowards
'cause just yesterday them fools tried to blast me
saw the police and they rolled right past me
no flexin', didn't even look in a brother’s direction
as i ran the intersection
went to short dog's house, they was watchin' yo! mtv raps
what's the haps on the craps?
shake 'em up, shake 'em up, shake 'em up, shake 'em
roll 'em in a circle of homies
and watch me break 'em with the 7, 7-11, 7-11
7, even back door little joe
i picked up the cash flow
then we played bones, and i'm yellin': "domino!"
plus nobody i know got killed in south central la
today was a good day


a good day
a good day
a good day
i can't believe today was a good day

a good day
a good day
a good day

left my homie’s house paid
picked up a girl been tryna dig since the 12th grade

it's ironic, i had the brew, she had the chronic
the lakers beat the supersonics

i felt on the big fat fanny
pulled out the jammy and killed the punani

and my jimmy runs deep, so deep
so deep put her butt to sleep
woke her up around one
she didn't hesitate to call ice cube the top gun
drove her to the pad and i'm coastin'
took another sip of the potion, hit the three-wheel motion

i was glad everything had worked out
dropped her ass off and then chirped out
today was like one of those fly dreams
didn't even see a berry flashin' those high beams

no helicopter lookin' for a murder
two in the morning got the fatburger
even saw the lights of the goodyear blimp
and it read "ice cube's a pimp" (yeah)
drunk as hell, but no throwin' up
halfway home and my pager still blowin' up
today i didn't even have to use my ak
i gotta say, it was a good day


i can’t believe was a good day
