we run a-town, we run la (show em')
now get down on your motherfuckin' belly
before this ak make you do a ballet
it's the nut cracker, i'm the linebacker
three motherfuckers, hard as concrete
y'all motherfuckers soft as gandhi
pull that thing out, now you a zombie
all damn quick you know where i be
west side rolling, all day, everyday
got your bitch open, you're fucking with heavyweights
lightweights stay on myspace
and stay the fuck outta my face (you know!)
ghostwriters i'm on ya'
from atlanta, georgia to california
this shit can't go no longer
and when i catch ya, i'ma dome ya
