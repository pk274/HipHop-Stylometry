come hit the town, drop down nigga
l-a-x, top down nigga
i'm scoopin' you up, ya rollin' or what?
i know what ya came for, i'm rollin' it up
snoop dogg nigga, y'all hold up
never thought ice cube would show up
but i'm in the studio gettin' fucked up
with a beat from battlecat, a nigga lucked up
i got my hustle down, look and learn
see how a hot nigga, cook and burn
a nigga earn like david stern
mixed with big worm when he off that sherm
now - bust a u-turn, come by your hood
for motherfuckers that think i went hollywood
pick a coast, it got to be the west
i live out there, from the w.s. nigga


fell asleep on the plane, and so did he
woke up chillin' in the lbc
i grew up in the nhc
but that ain't what i turned out to be
understand me that i'm still a g
who ain't never spent a day in the penitentiary
now i'm rappin' with snoop d-o double-g
and got the whole fuckin' world nigga lovin' me
yep yep, they love him to death
cause he walk under water, without gettin' wet
roll through the neighborhood without gettin' checked
so gone and so blown, are we there yet?
you wonder why i got the s on my chest
cause i'm a motherfuckin' vet from the wild wild west
i used to sing "bennie and the jets"
nigga so boss now i sip henny on my jets
from the east back to the west
