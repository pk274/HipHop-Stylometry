what up youngin? i see you gunnin'
got 'em runnin', nephew, don't give a fuck about a curfew
he'll murk you and hurt you
'cause to him, you know, life is not a virtue
talk fast as he walk past
roll his eyes, don't give a fuck about your advice
what you want? 'cause he gotta go
bring your ass over here, nigga, and listen to the o
i'm just tryin' to lace you
so they won't come investigate you
but if i can't make a breakthrough
i'll come to your funeral and try to awake you
