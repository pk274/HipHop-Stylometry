here comes the nigga with the ruff, the terror
the paranoid, gots to get the boy
get your steel 'cause i feel like a headbanger
yeah i got a gang of shits, styles guns
my uzi weighs a motherfucking ton
bucking down one, bucking down two
bucking down your crew, motherfuck you
pigs wear blue, i wear black, nothing but black
'cause goddamn it's a brand new payback
fuck pat sajak, never did nothing for a nigga
on the trigger, the zigga, the zag, the nickel, the bag
the nigga, the sag, the forty-four mag got you running like a fag
so, keep your motherfucking jokes
'cause i'm that nigga with a fresh pair of locs
no yokes but smokes
crackers and them dirty mackers friends aren't jackers
get yah for your drawers, young niggas out to kill for the cause


now they're after me, why? 'cause a nigga's black
spittin' facts and ain't afraid to pull a trigger back
let 'em come step to a real motherfucker
(boom boom) mama ain't raised no suckers
dan quayle, don't you know you need your ass kicked?
where was you when there was niggas in the caskets?
motherfucker rednecks all the same
fear a real nigga if he ain't balled and chained
that's why we burn shit and wreck
'cause the punk police ain't learned shit yet
you mutha-fuckas gonna pay the price
can't make a black life, don't take a black life
it's on, the next real nigga fall dead
dread, jheri curl, process, or bald head
be prepared for the smoke to bust
(what niggas need to do is start loc'in up)
united we stand, divided we fall
they can shoot one nigga, but they can't take us all
let's get along with the mexicans
and we can all have peace on the sets again
imagine that if it took place, ha (ha haaaa)
keeping the smiles off they white face
i ain't racist but let's trade places
trace the hate 'n then face it
one nigga teach two niggas
three teach four niggas and them niggas teach more niggas
and when we blast that'll be the biggest blast you've heard
and them is my last wordz
