we dream gangsta shit
supreme gangsta shit
we dream gangsta shit


the mega don, uh-huh, the episode
scrillions is what a nigga fold
we meant it, rollin’ in tinted, the authentic
ghetto scented, we invented, highly recommended
go independent, and defend it
ain’t scared to throw up my dub and represent it (westside)
it’s beretta and mister mo’ cheddar
let ice cube rhyme last, niggas know better
see me in this godfather, you better tuck your tail
fuck a bitch dreams, niggas waiting too in hell
take a photo, niggas know, though
ice cube went from soul-glo to a fuckin’ mogul
bet your hoe know we’s in town, fresh off con-air
gave a concierge cab fare, pullin’ hair, slappin’ titties
giving her shitties to new jack cities
delectable, rich and pretty
