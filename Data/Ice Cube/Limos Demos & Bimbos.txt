(hey did you hear that?)
yeah just get the fuckin door *car door opens and closes*


hit the sunroof, and let's contemplate the freaks we can run through
got the chauffer pullin over
snatch one inside, she wanna ride with this mission
close the partition, he like to listen
all fuckin, no kissin, just smokin and drinkin
super vets in a super stretch lincoln
thinkin bout the good ol' days of hip hop
in its purest form before the eye of the storm
i could give a fuck about you hatin, on my way
to the colliseum with seventeen-five waitin
they scream for the limousine, it's all clean
tinted, your shit is rented, you know we spend it
while you worry bout the five mics, i'm in the limelight
wit movies comin out, yo' time is runnin out
i just finished doin "live at the apollo"
indication from my driver damn we're bein followed


the alley was pitch black, i'm in the back of this black lac
these fuckers pull up in a ac
they don't understand the impact
two thousand dollar three-piece suit, can you spend that?
they call me the don mega (don mega) *motorcycle speeding past*
cos i'm down to play a double-header in stormy weather
superstar, goddamn them niggas got me
stop the car and blast the paparazzi *gun shots, motorcycle*
