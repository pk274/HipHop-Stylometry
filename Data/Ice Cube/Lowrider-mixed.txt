raspberry 64 bring your cherry in
we could make a sunday, come home monday
i'm sittin' on the one-way, up on the boulevard
act hard put ya' thoughts on the dashboard
'cause if i come through the 'hood with the little homie
nobody better fuck with the little homie
i hope compton unite, south central unite
i hope my chrome, and dance with the moon light
