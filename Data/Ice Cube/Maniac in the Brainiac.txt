in every game, we gotta have the brains and the muscle
the game and the hustle
to be real on these streets
so here you have it, the brainiac (ice cube)
with the maniac (mack 10)
yay-y-yay
yay-y-yay


while y'all niggas think about the pink
i think about which titanic i'ma sink
the iceberg with the nice words
i slice verbs and predicates, ghetto etiquette
y'all better get, this don mega shit
the braniac, the theory be conspiracy
keep my eye on the birdie, but never get my hands dirty
verbally call the maniac and his attack dogs
signing contracts with automatic jack clause


brainiac with maniac mack 10
you do the drivin', while i do the jackin'
brainiac with maniac mack 10
my nigga, if you plot it, best believe i got it
(ladeedah, ladeedah, ladeedah, ladeedah)
and it's on
(ladeedah, ladeedah, ladeedah, ladeedah)
feel the chrome


you in the stargate, trying to escape, it's not an option
got torture techniques for them lies, don't ever vie
just put the car in drive, we can go ride, get this money
determined as the energized bunny, make a left
underground parking, guns start sparkin'
atf enemies all around start chargin'
tryin' to fuck up my new suit and my weekend
ask me what you want, you bitch, i ain't speakin'


brainiac with maniac mack 10
you do the drivin', while i do the jackin'
brainiac with maniac mack 10
hey cube, if you plot it, best believe i got it
(ladeedah, ladeedah, ladeedah, ladeedah)
and it's on
(ladeedah, ladeedah, ladeedah, ladeedah)
feel the chrome


what's the plan? everything thought out
everything bought out, like bill gates
my niggas love steel weights
i'm still great after twelve muthafuckin' years
i'll serve your ass after twelve muthafuckin' beers
i act kind to my peers and everybody that listen
they know when the brainiac's missin'
the big fish, hanging with the chicken hawk
got all the haters, claimin' that they wanna talk


brainiac with maniac mack 10
you do the drivin', while i do the jackin'
brainiac with maniac mack 10
if you plot it, best believe i got it
(ladeedah, ladeedah, ladeedah, ladeedah)
and it's on
(ladeedah, ladeedah, ladeedah, ladeedah)
keep taking 'til it's gone
(ladeedah, ladeedah, ladeedah, ladeedah)
and it's on
(ladeedah, ladeedah, ladeedah, ladeedah)
feel the wrath of the chrome
