i mash like potatoes, but i'm macaroni
remember when i used to eat fried bologna
a san francisco treat, rice-a-roni
pimp shit, goldie vers' pretty tony
i used to sleep on the couch like that nigga jj
learned my hip-hop from 1580 kday
once, twice, three times a lady
i did a movie with smokey and one with day-day
i used to watch m*a*s*h while i did my homework
now i gotta mash 'cause i got my own work
never get too big for your britches
concentrate on your riches, not on your bitches
sid vicious, yeah, i get malicious
scarface, no more doin' dishes
so if you see me, put these up (these up)
i beat you down, i don't ease up (ease up)
