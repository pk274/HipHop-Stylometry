gangsta, gangsta, tell me how you done it?
take it worldwide, but keep it one-hundred
straight runnin', america's most wanted (who?)
y'all can pump your brakes, i'ma gun it
might wreck, yeah, i cause damage
niggas on my shit like a fuckin' chicken sandwich
fightin' in the drive-thru
from here to the bayu, crippin' to pyru
i'll rather have some barbecue
and talk about the tendencies of our real enemies
we gotta figure it out
while some motherfuckers want to nigga it out
i keep ten toes down and they grip the ground
head too big, to fit the crown
the fat lady sing, that's all she wrote
i got to be the greatest if i ain't the g.o.a.t., nigga
