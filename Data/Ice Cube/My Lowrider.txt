rasberry 64 bring your cherry
and we could make a sunday, come home monday
i'm sittin on the one-way, up on the boulevard
act hard, put ya thoughts on the dashboard
cause if i come through the hood with the little homie
nobody better fuck with the little homie
i hope compton unite, south central unit
i hope my chrome, and dance with the moon light
