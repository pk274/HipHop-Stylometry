homie, what the fuck you doin' in my kitchen?
you know i got the system, facial recognition
i got your ass on camera
and you ain't lookin' nothin' like santa (goddamn ya)
i'ma send your ass to the slammer
i'ma be there when the judge drop the hammer
yеah, punk bitch, you better put it back
let 'еm know we got cameras on this cul-de-sac
i woulda cut off your eyelids
you lucky they caught your ass 'fore i did
i tell your ass that i'm pretty violent
when i catch a porch pirate tryna be quiet
i sneak up real silent
caught you on the ring, turn you into a meme
yeah, i saw your ass on the 'gram
i was goin' ham, did you see that body slam?
