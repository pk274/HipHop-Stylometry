willie d


warriors, come out and play with yo gay ass vest
you can't shoot 'em up with the wild west
and i hold a pistola, brown as coca cola
coming from the shooters with the 1, 2, bang, ping
make your ears ring (with the supernatural thing)
it's like i got a 12 gauge when i'm walking
shut the fuck up when grown folks is talking
cause i don't play with kids, i shut eyelids
forever and a day, nigga what you say?
bailing down a street in my chuck taylors off-brand
niggas mad dumb but they can't fade us (never)
wishin they could be like me and willie d
not just a punk ass trick silly gee
you better take that little shit to your mama
(westside rolling) fool with the drama

it don't stop, uh, yeah
you better play witcha mama
