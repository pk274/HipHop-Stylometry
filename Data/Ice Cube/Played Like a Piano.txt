do-rae-me, but i don't sing, mothafucker
i kick shit with the king, mothafucker
ice cube will clock the cash, rock the mass
and if you run up, i'll sock your ass
and watch that eye get swollen
'cause i'm playin' punk niggas like beethoven
so bust a cap, or swing and die
fuck yul brynner, it's still the king and i
'cause where i'm from, the sun don't shine
so one-time hope i only bust one rhyme
but i bust one mo' for the suckers
last year i was ruthless, now i'm lynchin' mothafuckers
and you'll see in a tree, mc's and crews
now they're lookin' for me, king tee, and pooh
now every nigga that crossed me's soprano
'cause i played their ass like a fuckin' piano
