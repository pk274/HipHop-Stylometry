everybody in here know what the fuck it is
i'm a gangsta, nigga, and i put that on my kids
i do a movie, homie, do it for some bratty kids
ain't go no problem with blowin' off their daddy wig
the first rapper to flick it and make it stick (make it stick)
now i'm an actor - yeah right - ain't that a bitch?
believe that shit like it's all an act, trick
you get your ass kicked quicker than a crack bitch
it's automatic even though i'm diplomatic (what's up?)
i ain't tatted but you'll still get your brain splattered
same niggas that's mad i never been to juvy
be like, "yo cube, nigga, put me in a movie"


see, i'ma ball, i might outlive 'em all
how the fuck you gon' run before you crawl? (how?)
i done seen 'em fly, i done seen 'em fall
i done seen 'em get shot comin' out the mall
i done seen 'em blow up like kanye west
and fall out the sky faster than a jumbo jet
crash and burn - rappers, are you humbled yet?
surreal life - muthafucka, are you on it yet?
ice cube is always in his prime (fa sho)
do he sleep? 'cause he always on the grind
i got a lifetime of icing and gravy
please don't hate me 'cause i sleep like a baby


everybody know that i grew up in 1-11
i ain't a crip but still i am an urban legend
in the hood, i used to count on aggression
nowadays, a nigga countin' all his blessings
smith and wesson'll send your ass straight to heaven
if you think a nigga turned into a reverend
i'm a deacon, bitch, just like deacon jones
come around the corner, break all your freakin' bones
heard a voice in my head when i was on the corner (ice cube)
do for self, nigga, fuck the state of california
'cause they'll bury you alive in concrete and steel (for real)
this bullshit is a trap, i'm just being real
