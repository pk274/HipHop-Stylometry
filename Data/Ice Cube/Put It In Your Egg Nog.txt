ayo, yo, yo
crack the top on the verse with no rehearsal
and here's a brand new st. ides commercial
from the i to the c to the e
to the c to the u to the b to the e, and that's me
and i'm talking about the st. ides malt liquor
it'll probably make ya faint
and you'll paint the town red
after you take a 40 dog to the head
me and the lench mob crew like to gang up
on a quart, 'cause it'll keep your yang up
and then it relax me
everybody want some so i gotta get a taxi
so i won't get a dui is the reason
can't go to jail this holiday season


all i want for christmas is my st. ides brew
all i want for christmas is my st. ides brew
all i want for christmas is my st. ides brew
yo pooh (what up?), i'm through
and put it in your egg nog
