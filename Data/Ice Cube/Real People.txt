come with it
(the only race on the planet is the human one)
real talk
(spread love)


we used to fight and fuss, we used to yell and cuss
we used to cock and bust now look at us
we done turned to ashes and dust to dust
i shoulda turned to cuz and returned the love
i shoulda passed the bud to all the bloods
and leave them slugs with them pigs in the mud
who the fuck turned 2pac into a thug?
all i used to get was a pound and a hug
i remember when we used to hate them drugs
now we can't rap without being fucked up
high in the club but you sound like a drunk
hard in the street but a jailhouse punk
me and that nigga, yeah, we used to bring the funk
now we got love and respect like a monk
understand that we got a lot in common
homie, you in the same boat that i'm in


i'm callin' all the real people (real people)
let 'em know that the change gon' come
tell me where the real people? (real people)
it's time to wake up and stand as one
callin' all the real people (real people)
you still got our faith, nah, we ain't done
tell me where the real people (out there)
the real people (out there)
