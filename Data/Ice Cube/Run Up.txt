security pat-downs
i'm a star, motherfucker, i been put the gat down
i been put' the mac down
but check the people that i'm with
'cause they'll lay you flat down
and they'll do it right now
yeah, you scared of the phone numbers that a nigga might dial
club-hop, car shows, picnics
big cars, big jewels, big dicks
rush doors, or gotta hop the fence
clothing stores, gotta blow my rent
gotta show my ass, then go repent
gotta call in sick, and tell 'em where i went
(buck 'em, buck 'em, buck 'em)
don't want no problems, y'all
fuck around, i'll pull out the problem solved
and watch egos dissolve
nine times out of ten, you hoes involved
