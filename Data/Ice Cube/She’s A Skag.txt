well i was at this party, feeling kind of horny
so i went to the bar, ordered coke and bacardi, yes
i was chillin' like an ordinary dude
smellin' real good, could see the attitude
and then i saw a freak that i think i'd admire
i strolled on over, and sat down beside her
i said "i'm ice cube, from the stereo crew"
she looked at her friend, then they both said "who?"
ice cube, to rock the joint
conceded mc, but that's beside the point
and don't turn your back baby, just give me a chance
i only walked over to you to ask for a dance
to dance yes baby, it's you i select
to get you on the floor is the main object
but you a stuck up flict, i tried to hit
comin' in dead last at a beauty pageant


she's a skag (scallywag) when she really needs a bag
walk around town lookin' like a sea hag
but i talked to her, i must've been mad
but every other girl look just as bad


fellas out there you better beware
skags are lurkin' everywhere
they're every topic, as quick as a rocket
but most of the time you find them in your pocket
when you're poor and broke, they won't talk to ya
when your income is sufficient, they wish they knew ya
you can spot her from a mile, they're always on the prowl
runnin' that drag with a kool-aid smile
and if you haven't heard the latest, her drag is the greatest
out of all the crooked people, she try to be the straightest
but there's one mistake, you can not make
don't forget the smile on her face is fake
so leave it alone, we advise
we hope you all out there realize
if a girl's like this, don't boast, don't brag
'cause you've got a girl that we call a skag
