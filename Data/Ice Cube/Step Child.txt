once we get on top, i'm fuckin' you over
and that's on jehovah (on god)
yep, i'm treatin' you colder
and fryin' yo' ass, and turnin' you over
see, i am a soldier
no mercy from me (no), this verse is for free
'cause, i am the man
i'm shakin' your hand and takin' your land (my lord)
with the help from the god
with me and my rod, let's end this facade (blow it up)
your world is corrupt
motherfucker, your time is up
