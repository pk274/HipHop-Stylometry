straight outta compton, it's a crazy brotha named ice cube
from the stupid-dope gang wit a attitude
when i'm called off, i gotta sawed-off
kick knowledge and bodies are hauled off
you too boy if you get with me
the police are gonna have to come and get me
off yo back, that's how i'm going out
for the sucka dumb brothas that's showing out
some start to mumble, they wanna rumble
mix em and cook em in a pot like gumbo
going off on everybody like that
with bass that's droppin' in your face
so give it up smooth
ain't no telling when i'm down for a jack move
here's a murder rap to keep you dancing
with a crime record like charles manson
yo dre, what's the sound of my tool?
now you know that i'm about to act a fool
me you can go toe to toe, no maybe
i'm knocking suckas out the box, daily
yo weekly, monthly and yearly
until the whole damn world see clearly
that i'm down with the capital c-p-t
boy, you can't step to me
so when i'm in your neighborhood, you better duck down
cause ice cube will damn sure buck 'em down
as i leave, believe i'm stomping
but when i come back boy, i'm coming straight outta compton
