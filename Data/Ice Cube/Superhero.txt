if you lookin' at your man, and he look like a scarecrow
(you need a) superhero, superhero
he actin' all tough like robert de niro?
(you need a) superhero, superhero
add it all up, he still equal to zero
(you need a) superhero, superhero
i'm comin' to arrest you, i'm comin' to the rescue
(you need a) superhero, superhero


it's a bird, it's a plane, nigga stronger than a train
that bitch bruce wayne better stay in his lane
boy, i spit flame like a dragon
watch how they actin', when they rеlease the krakеn
you know, save everything but a hoe
yo momma won't let go off the jiggalo
she call me a marvel, you a d.c. comic
yup, straight-up retardo
i started off with too much cargo
dropped the avengers, picked up my ninjas
knocked the door off the hinges
fuck the cowboys, down with the indians
blacker than a panther
if this was wakanda, i'll spit the anthem
i only got a villain as a friend
you know his name bitch, mc ren, let's go


if you lookin' at your man, and he look like a scarecrow
(you need a) superhero, superhero
he actin' all tough like robert de niro?
(you need a) superhero, superhero
add it all up, he still equal to zero
(you need a) superhero, superhero
i'm comin' to arrest you, i'm comin' to the rescue
