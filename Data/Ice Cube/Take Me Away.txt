hahaha, today was a good day
know what?, sometimes i just get on my knees
you know what i mean?
and pray to the man with the master plan
to swoop on down (swoop on down)
on that mothership, scoop a nigga up...


lord have mercy, my people so thirsty
come feed 'em, either jesus or muhammad
all we get is vomit, come like a comet
put it in my brain lord, put it in my stomach
only you can run it, i'ma learn from it
do what i gotta do, try not to plummet
america eats its youth like reptiles
don't worry bout tomorrow, let's get this right now
they want to run us in the ground
educate yourself before they dumb you down
get your money boy, the legal way
beat 'em with they own bullshit if you may
now rich white men they got the world fucked up
why should i give a fuck about a styrofoam cup?
environmental scene, i'll keep it clean
but if i go green, you know what i mean, bitch


ice cube for president
let's just do it for the hell of it
see how i'd run the government - make money irrelevant
i might tell a chick, it's illegal to be celibate
secret service don't know where the hell i went
sorry y'all, i had to fuck a superdelegate
dream ticket, ice cube and obama
american dream, ice cube and yo' mama
the terminator, are you sarah connor?
arnold schwarzenegger, can kill who he wanna?
in california, they strap you to a gurney
and murder yo' ass, in front of your attorney
do you really wanna take this journey?
ain't scared of none of y'all motherfuckers like bernie
mac (step back) step back, i got the mac-11
unlike obama, i'mma have to back my reverand


now the lord is my shepherd, my flow is respected
worldwide, from the west i got to rep it
so please check it, cause my style is infected
with the virus, ice cube's the osiris
i bail through, they wanna put me up in bellevue
cause my point of view is not red, white and blue
it's black and blue residue
i know what crack can do, to a whole fuckin' avenue
speak on it and they'll get mad at you
you think i do this bullshit for your gratitude?
i'm a nigga with a attitude
i'mma do what i gotta do just to change my latitude
pimp the system, rollin' with my diamonds glistenin'
and niggas listenin', from your local prison
i'm a prism, your only vision is a rainbow
in the sky when i spit the ism, come on


damn, it feels good to be independent
