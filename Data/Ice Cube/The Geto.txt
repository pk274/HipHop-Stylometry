i got to give it up to my ghetto niggas, and that ghetto bitch
looking for them ghetto licks, getting ghetto rich
knowing that the scheme in the book flip the game
quick to get my telephone turned on in my mama's name
this ghetto slang is some shit that can beat college
you ain't fucking with this hustler with street knowledge
9 to 5, still flipping 20's on the side, drop it by the fence
making dollars out of fifteen cents
got the big body benz with the wheels on it
a cell phone with no bills on it
ghetto ass, got to feel on it, still want it
baby, kneel on it, and i can put the kill on it
you got this rap nigga lying like a singer
put your baby to sleep, and turn off your ringer
you can catch me on van wick looking sick in a six
with somethin' swiss on my wrist, now picture this
you better blow, 'cause too many niggas up at mr. jackson's do'
y'all niggas got to go
the ghetto
