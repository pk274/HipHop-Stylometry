picture a nigga that's raw
amplify his ass and what you see is what's saw
motherfuckers i slaughter, blow 'em out the water
word to me, fuck the father
my medley is deadly as a pin in a hand grenade
5 seconds before you get played
you can't throw me, i guess you'll blow up
ever see a sucker scattered? it'd make you throw up
then i take advantage, you can't manage
to get up, all you can do is sit up, i get lit up
hit up, ice cube tear shit up like a dude you can bet on
collide like a head on
collision, stutter stepping is an incision
of a nigga saying exactly what i vision
because i'm gone, you think i left you all
but i stay in yo' ass like cholesterol
when i blast, i'm solid as alcatraz
and if you escape, you better swim fast
'cause i'll catch ya, physically and mentally
and the capital punishment's the penalty
sit in the electric chair, grab a hold
pull the switch, your body twitch, your eyes explode out your skull
'cause being dull on a flow is a n-o
niggas didn't know that i can go
off and show off to throw off the law
turn, take ten spaces then draw
what's left is a motherfucker dead in the alley
ice cube is the shit on the grand finale
