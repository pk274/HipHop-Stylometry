i thought i saw a pussy...uh, cat, that is
k-dee, baby


i always swung around, never hung around a group of zeroes
nicest when i flow, like a mold, like a superhero
so up, up and away, i sway with the coolest
you ask, "who this?" - well, it's the newest
kid on the set, i bet i got the formula
i'll swarm on ya, i'll put somethin' warm in ya
undercover, now i'm the brotha who
can get the job done, it's k-dee to the rescue
i'm the man, you wouldn't understand
with a style so different, it'll leave you wonderin'
i wake up, cake up, shake 'em like dice
cook 'em like minute rice, so now i'm in it twice
a week, a freak is all i need
weed and some drank, all it takes for me to spank (what?)
that ass, at last, k-dee is top notch, so
in '94, i'm the one you got to watch for
i keep a low profile with that slow flow style
i'll make your ho go wild (that's right)
on the prowl, foul with the lingo
don't sweat the technique because i came just to mingle


i thought i saw a puddycat, caught her peekin'
oh, where she at? i must be tweakin'
i never knew when i grew up it was real
i had no ideal, i just blew up
the spot, a knot in my pocket
i shoot like a rocket
with the loot, you got a boot, then let me knock it (that's right)
'cause i don't see nothin' wrong, with a little bump and grind (bitch)
yeah, you know there's something i
been wantin' to show ya, know ya been peepin' out my program
it's simple, with the tempo of a slow jam
but far from r&b, 'cause if it's starring me
the one and only, gigolos get lonely
too, i thought you knew, i make it smooth like c.l
peep it, but just keep it on the dl
i got it under control, we could roll to my hideout
so i can turn it inside-out (hahaha)
always and forever (yeah), never frontin'
('cause we down for whatever, punk)
whatever you wanna do, let's get to it
you know how we do it


ah yeah, baby
and i thought i saw a pussycat
i thought i saw a pussycat
i thought i saw a pussycat
there it is
i thought i saw a pussycat
(thought i saw a pussycat)
(thought i saw a pussycat)
yeah, somethin' smell fishy, baby
(thought i saw a pussycat)
(thought i saw a pussycat)


you got the right one, baby (uh-huh)
k-dee is the one who made the
hoes say, "hey", each and every day
of the week/weak at the knees
i make it, might take it to another level
crew and let 'em handle theirs like players, do
comin' from the west so i suggest you just rest that body
i heard that you're naughty by nature
please, i ain't tryna date ya
so back the fuck up, i know that you want this
you on my jock 'cause of the way that i flaunt this (that's right)
smoothness, i proved this on the last song that i cut
when my nigga tried to make it ruff (who, me?)
i make 'em see stars, they go twinkle twinkle
i can't be your lover if your pussy's wrinkled (haha)
wink your eye, why, try to play me out
i thought i saw a pussycat


ah yeah, baby
i thought i saw a pussycat
i smell somethin' fishy
(thought i saw a pussycat)
ah yeah
i thought i saw a pussycat
twinkle twinkle
(thought i saw pussycat)

here, kitty kitty, titty titty

(k-dee is the mack; k-dee is the mack)
here, kitty kitty, gettin' live in the city
i'm lookin' for somethin' to smell
