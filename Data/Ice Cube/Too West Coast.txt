my ego, is big as heathrow
yep, this elite flow, easy as a free throw
yes this negro, is rather lethal
you about as lethal, as a mojito
be my amigo, eat my burrito
you a fuckin' seagull, up in fred segal
i'm up in a regal, still in my pea coat
murder's what she wrote, this is mo' evil
this is less than zero, don't be a hero
nigga i'm a pharaoh, with double barrels
goose bumps, hair rose, when i shoot these arrows
at your camaros, rollin' down melrose
still down with elcos 'til the fuckin cell close
nigga don't test me, you're gonna fail those
they should arrest me, blow like dizzy gillespie
i don't aim where yo' vest be (bang)


motherfuckers tell me - i'm too west coast
they act like they scared of me - i'm too west coast
motherfuckers tell me - i'm too west coast
they act like they scared of me - i'm too west coast
motherfuckers tell me - i'm too west coast
they act like they scared of me - i'm too west coast
motherfuckers tell me - i'm too west coast
they act like they scared of me - i'm too west coast
