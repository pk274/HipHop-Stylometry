we don't want no 8-ball
do you like 8-ball? (oh no)
yo, we don't want no 8-ball
do you like 8-ball? (oh no)
bank it in the side pocket


what is this? some old bullshit (ayo, ayo)
took a sip and had to spit 'cause i ain't
with that beer called the o.e
'cause i'm o.g. ice cube, down with the s-t-i
you looked and it was gone
grab me a 40 just to get my buzz on
'cause i needed just a little more kick
hooked like a fish after just one sip (yo)
put it to my lips and ripped the top off
8-ball done dropped off 'cause st. ides hopped off (what?)
and my hood won't be the same
after ice cube take a st. ides to the brain (yo)
and loc up, matter of fact, you know what?
let's bail to the store - you're broke, what?
dig deep into your dickies
grab somethin', yo, and please stop frontin'
or i might have to go solo
and if you ask for some, i'ma throw a bolo (bank)
and get real fly, and when i die
bury me with my st. ides (yeah)
