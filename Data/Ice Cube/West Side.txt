hello
the motherfuckin' world is a ghetto
full of magazines, full clips, and heavy metal
when the smoke settle
i'm just lookin' for a big yellow
in six inch stilettos
dr. dre, hello, perculatin', keep 'em waitin'
while you sittin' here hatin', yo' bitch is hyperventilatin'
hopin' that we penetratin', you gets naythin'
'cause i never been to satan for hardcore administratin'
gangbang affiliatin', mc ren'll have you
wildin' off a zone and a whole half a gallon
(get to dialing) 9-1-1 emergency
(and you can tell 'em) it's my son, he's hurtin' me
(and he's a felon) on parole for robbery
ain't no coppin' a plea, ain't no stoppin' a g
i'm in the 6, you got to hop in the 3, company monopoly
you handle shit sloppily, i drop a ki properly
they call me the don dada
pop a collar, drop a dollar, if you hear me you can holla
even rottweilers follow the impala
wanna talk about this concrete? nigga, i'm a scholar
the incredible, heterosexual, credible
beg a ho, let it go, dick ain't edible
nigga ain't federal, i plan shit
while you, hand picked motherfuckers, givin' up transcripts

6:34

did i fall off? got you in your room
rippin' every "chronic" poster on your wall off
just 'cause i put away the sawed off
now i got you sittin' back with a smirk
listening with your arms crossed
questioning dre's credibility (what?)
wondering if it's still in me to produce hits
y'all be killin' me
as if i need to make mo', i got a mansion
and six cars that are paid fo', suck my dick! (hello)
we came a long way from not givin' a fuck
sellin' tapes out of a trunk to movin' this far up
now we got the whole world starstruck
made a million-plus and still don't give a motherfuck
motherfucker, i'm dre! i don't need your respect
i don't need to make another album, bitch, i don't gotta do shit
i do it because i want to, not to stay in the game
fuck the fame, i'm still stayin' the same, lil' bitch! (hello)

7:36

villain blows up yo' spot
take yo' notebook, yo' bitch and yo' glock
this motherfucker thought the coochie had a padlock
you slapped her ass, that's alarmin'
'cause she want my worm like carmen
we chin check niggas, them thin check niggas
run trains on gold diggers, beware these fo' niggas
scarin' motherfuckers like stephen king flicks
makin' niggas clear the room like a dyke fleein' dick
makin 2nd ii none shit, nigga like quik
so when i bomb first, nigga, who you rollin' with?
fuck that ice on your wrist, fuck yo' fine ass bitch
'cause you could lose it in a tussle, nigga, watch me hustle
watch niggas kiss my ass without flexin' a muscle
bitches, all in the back, they knees waitin' to buckle
same time, same channel, don't change the dial
niggas 4 life, fuckin' your wife, these niggas wild (hello)
