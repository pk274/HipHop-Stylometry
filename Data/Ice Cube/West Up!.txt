now i got ta show you how the west coast rocks
no razor blades in my mouth, just a glock
and i'm hittin you up, with that w-s
the sun rises in the east, but it sets in the west
no gold teeth, you gets a wreath
so hand me the goodies, stockin mask, no hoodies
christmas day, i'm in a tre
while some of you niggas got the robe reindeer and a sleigh
we don't call it five-oh, we call it one time
it's my life my life my life my life, in the sunshine!
one nine weighs a ton
how the fuck you think that the west was won?
now shit can be squashed over a forty ounce of backwash
no jokes, the land of locs and hundred spokes
in the east, we can be brothers
but when you come to l.a., watch your motherfuckin colors
west up! nigga
