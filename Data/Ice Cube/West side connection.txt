it's the don daddy with the villain, who you killing
oh we hate them, come verbatim with this cap peeling
top billin, make a million
paparazzi, chase us through the tunnel in the maserati
now they got me on hard copy didn't have to shoot versace
yet you still wanna watch me
motherfuckers wait they whole fuckin life and aday
hopin' that we can reunite n.w.a
all purpose, try to serve us, gettin' nervous, more murders
shit can just turn into the circus
standin over the carcass
you look like the kind of nigga that'd press charges
we the largest, we the biggest, we the niggas, with the attitudes
we longitude, you latitude, have some gratitude
to the niggas that started this shit
been around forever bitch, we smart at this shit
