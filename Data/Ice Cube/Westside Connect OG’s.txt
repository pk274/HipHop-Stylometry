we breakin' niggas down to nubs, slap 'em with the dub
make 'em cover up, bustas get no love
quick, bink, pass me the paddle
niggas wanna battle, they don't know i strike like a rattle
connection niggas on the spin, once again
you hear the siren, you can't comprehend
i got my strap in the waistband
and if you fuck with the set, i got to blow up your place, man
keep my fingers on the trigger
representin' the hood and dyin' for my niggas
we the best on the planet
and fuck every politician in the world tryin' to ban it
back to work, nigga, it's the boss with the nina ross
only got eight fuckin' bars to come off
goddizzang, niggas wanna kiss the rizzang of the kizzang
dub-s-c gizzang
bing bing bizzang, get like seven on the dice
you might catch us slippin' once, never catch us slippin' twice
y'all niggas gon' be moppin' our floors
you call it hip-hop, we call it star wars
