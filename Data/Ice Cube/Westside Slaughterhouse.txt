westside!


well, it's the dawg! breathin' out the smog
i'm a hog of this gangsta shit! don of the clique!
all you suckas wanna diss the pacific
but you busta niggas never get specific
used to love h.e.r., mad ‘cause we fucked a
pussy-whipped bitch with no common sense!
hip-hop started in the west!
ice cube bailin' through the east without a vest


(oh-i, oh-i...) do a walk by, and watch everybody die!
niggas into gangs, thangs and narcotics
freak bitches, riches and hydraulics
pull heat! knock you off your feet!
clear the whole block, both sides of the street!
even crips and bloods hear my thuds
fee-fie-foe-fum! ay, nigga, where you from?! (westside!)


westside’s on the map!
(niggas rappin’ since the ‘70s and still never went gold!)


when i say gitchy-gitchy! niggas get bitchy-bitchy
‘cause they heard of the natural born murderer
i'm like frankenstein, it's spankin' time
layin' in the sunshine with only one 9
so who wants to bust with the never-rust?
doin' platinum plus every time i cuss
so fuck the whole world, black! (fuck ‘em!)
niggas better hope i don't grow my jheri-curl back


fuck one love! it's the bloody glove, killin' honkey hoes
leavin' blood stains on broncos
in a hertz rental, i drive on the 405 — is he dead or alive?
mutha-fuck court! took another snort
jumpin' over chairs as i run through the airport
so i can catch a flight away from the drama
number 32, chillin' in the bahamas


westside’s on the map!
