tadow, how you like me now, i'm in the mix?
it's 1986 and i got the fix with the chicken and a quota
got the baking soda, let the water boil, workers all loyal
dropped out the twelfth
cuz my wealth is shorter than a midget on his knees
now i slang keys
infest my hood with crack, cuz i'm the mack
take a nation of millions to hold me back
too big for my britches, and i got bitches
now i'm hittin' switches, niggas want my riches
used to get 18 when my g was alive, now a key is 13-5
'89s the number, another summer
police ain't get no dumber
streets dried up, used to think it would last
but being a king-pin is a thing of the past
they tried to blast me for sellin' a boulder
now i got my ass in minnesota
got my own crew, it's on brand new
damn, what can i do?


tadow
(now it was on from dusk to dawn
and everything jumped)
what the fuck can i do?
tadow
(now it was on from dusk to dawn
and everything jumped)


already done stack me half a mill ticket
bought a house next to prince, so now i can kick it
now i got ends, wavin' to my friends, rollin' in my benz
goin' to see the twins, play at the dome
police are tappin' my mobile phone
i'm almost home
gettin' excited, indicted
spent a grip and a year tryin' to fight it
lawyer got paid, plea, no contest
and everything i own got repossessed
now take a look at the dust
and i'm happy cuz i only got 36 months
never picked up a book
but my arms are 16 inches, niggas look
can't wait for '92 so i can get with my crew
and see, what can i do?

(now it was on from dusk to dawn

fucked up in the pen, now it's ninety-fo'
back in la, and i'm bailin' in the dough
everybody, now i gotta start from scratch
so where to work at, and niggas smirk at
me say ain't nuttin' poppin from here to the lb
what you tell me?
no it ain't crack, and everybody's jackin' for a coupe
cuz, they sent in the troops
even though i got muscle, that ain't my hustle
takin' niggas' shit in a tussle
no skills to pay the bills
takin' 'bout education to battle inflation
no college degree, just a dumb ass g
(yeah, you, nigga), who me?
i got a baby on the way, damn it's a mess
"have you ever been convicted of a felony?" yes
took some advice from my uncle fester
all dressed up in polyester
welcome to mcdonald's, may i please help you?
shit, what can i do?
