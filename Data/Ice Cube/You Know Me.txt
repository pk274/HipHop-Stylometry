now i'm an old nigga on the porch, way to big
it's a shame how this nigga influenced them kids
got 'em out there hustlin' and doin' the shit
and he don't do shit but sit and scratch on his dick
and it's not good that the hood is under a spell
it's a wonder why this nigga ain't under the jail
why they treat this motherfucka like the wizard of oz
cause i know what's happening like re-run and rogg
i'm a captain, yep the head nigga in charge
pull air force one, up out the garage
i'm the grand puba, uou part of my lodge
you mortals better pay, respect to the gods
you can cuss more, i'm mount rushmore
now you can sell more, you still al gore
nigga i'm the president, you just a resident
in my gangsta world, and you late with the fucking rent


i roll my good up, in my khakies (pay the cut, nigga)
throw my hood up, keep it og
you know it mayne, i got the hood with me
i got the hood with me
but these bitches get this money
got my thang out, keep it on me, you know it mayne
i got the hood with me, i got the hood with me
