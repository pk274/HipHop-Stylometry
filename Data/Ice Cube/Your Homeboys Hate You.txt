your homeboys hate you, i'mma violate you
give you that motherfucking broken bottle facial
this ain’t racial, your new name is rachel
got niggas in the pen, that might wanna date you
i underrate you, then annihilate you, like that fuckin' therapist that said i had a breakthrough
this is what i live for, this is called survival
all my rivals are dead on arrival


this is a revival, better bring your bible
these lyrics are something, you might wanna die for
i'm not libel, nigga i’m the dope
nope, that's a typo, nigga i'm the pope
west coast cycle, on a motorcycle
dressed like michael, it ain't halloween
my city is so mean, i'm idi amin
i'm the baker's man, got the cake, got the cream
the undertaker man, from laygaland
the world is my toy, like legoland
the old man in the van looking for his puppy
do you wanna help me, you tinder young guppie?
the big fish gotta eat, don't interrupt me
the ones who got away, are oh so lucky
the only thing found most of the time is a huffy
you pretty young thing, it’s about to get ugly
