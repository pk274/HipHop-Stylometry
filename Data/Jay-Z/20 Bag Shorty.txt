no more reasonable doubt, i've proven to be the illest mc
something's wrong with ya motor skills 'cause y'all ain't movin' me
i'm who you see musically when you want it done hot
comparin' you to me is a lesson in futility, stop!
i paint pictures beautifully but niggas is near sighted
don't worry about plagiarism, it'll take 'em years to bite it
but ya greatest fear is i don't write it
it just appears out of nowhere
like the information obtained by a psychic
like it or not i pay dues and expect to be paid back
why the fuck should i freestyle i'm gettin' paid to rap
i slay the track laid back, almost 'til it's a sin
tell ya god somebody's doin' a good job impersonatin' him
jay-hova, spittin' game from the range rover
what the fuck is y'all doin' in the third lane? get over
slow ya rota, i got it sewed up like a tailor
relatively easy like jerry heller
cream is cherry vanilla got chicks in the telly
belly up, soundin' like mahalia tryin' to tell y'all
y'all know the style, burn the town down
and change the locale, i'm doin the same shit 'cept its legit
it's jigga
