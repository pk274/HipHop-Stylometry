ugh
it's just different
i know it feels different
ugh


i only love her if her eyes brown
play this shit while you play around with my crown
king h-o, y'all should know by now
but if you don't know, ugh
millions on the wall in all my rooms
niggas couldn't fuck with my daughter's room
niggas couldn't walk in my daughter's socks
banksy, bitches, basquiat
i ran through that buck fifty live nation fronted me
they workin' on another deal, they talkin' two-hundred-fifty!
i'm holdin' out for three
two-seventy-five and i just might agree
ex-d-boy, used to park my beamer
now look at me, i can park in my own arena
i only love her if her weave new
i'm still a hood nigga, what you want me to do?
been hoppin' out the bm with your bm
taking her places that you can't go with your per diem
screamin' "carpe diem!" until i'm a dead poet
robin williams shit, i deserve a golden globe, bitch!
i'll take a ace in the meanwhile
you ain't gotta keep this, khaled, it's just a freestyle
fuck rap money, i've made more off grapes
fuck show money, i spent that on drapes
close the curtains, fuckboy, out my face
i whip the coke, let the lawyer beat the case
murder was the case that they gave me
i killed the herm√®s store, somebody save me
stuntin' to the max like, wavy!
oh, shit!
oh, stuntin' to the max, i'm so wavy
used to shop at tj maxx back in '83
i don't even know if it was open then
i ain't know oprah then
had the xl 80 bike, loud motor, they be like, "damn!"
when i'm comin' through, rrraaanngg
had the grill in '88, y'all niggas is late
you got all that, right?
ugh! i love this shit like my own daughter
spray these niggas, baby, just like daddy taught ya
