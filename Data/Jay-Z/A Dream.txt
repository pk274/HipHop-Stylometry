ohh, ooh, ohh
uh, uh, uh
it—it—it was all a dream
last night i had a dream
thoughts was racing through my head (it was all a dream)
felt so real to me (it was all)
this is what was said (all-all-all-all-a-all a dream)


"had a dream," i said, "'bout who?" he said
"'bout b.i.g.," i said, "that's big," he said
"dig what he said", "proceed," he said
"indeed," i said, so, breathe i did
"don't repeat what i say," i said, he said nothing
he agreed with his head, he just nodded like this
what i believe to be a yes, i repeated what was said
"it came to me like a whisper last evening," i said
"what's the deal, playboy?" was the greeting he said
first thing i wanted to know was the reason he was dead
"mo' money mo' problems,'" better believe it," he said
"careful what you wish for, you might receive it," he said
"i see," i said, "jealousy" i said
"got the whole industry mad at me," i said
then b.i. said, "hov, remind yourself:
nobody built like you, you designed yourself!"
"i agree," i said, "my one of a kind self"
getting stoned every day like jesus did
"what he said," i said, "has been said before"
"just keep doin your thing," he said; "say no more"
