we're the ones with the flame (yeah)
we're the fire that remains (turn rell up a lil' bit)
we're controllin' the game from now on (ugh)


geah! (hooo!)
it's the world-renowned internationally connected (yeah, yeah)
locally accepted, roc-a-fella records
don't get it confused (oh-oh, yeah)
doing what we do, b. sig. (it's the roc, baby)
rell, peedi crakk (it's the roc, baby)
free, young h-o, bleek (you understand, oh, oh)
and introducin'


call me p.c.!
tempers spilling, i peel, look how i'm killin' the wheel
the fitted tilt to the left, the shirt blend with the sweats
your girls skirts and veils, she undressing
don't stare, take a picture, nigga, packin' the bills


i'm the one! young h-o, a game of none
what you think i do to the brain of that dame you brung?
listen, hon! twist up one, this is armi—sip some
it's only 40 proof, it feel like 151 when i'm done!
make a run with the roc, rock air force 1's
rock a bun, hide shit in her hair when i come—
through customs, cops can't bust him
it's hov, the hustler; i'm having one hell of a run!
and you like it
all them haters talkin' shit, we don't like it
