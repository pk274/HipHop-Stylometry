let me get 'em, b, yeah
hundred million crib, three million watch, all facts
no cap; false nigga, you not a boss, you got a boss
niggas getting jerked, that shit hurts, i take it personally
niggas rather work for the man than to work with me
just so they can pretend they on my level, that shit is irkin' to me
pride always goeth before the fall, almost certainly
it's disturbing what i gross (what i gross!)
survey says you not even close (not even close)
everybody's bosses 'til it's time to pay for the office
'til them invoices separate the men, from the boys
over here we measure success by how many people successful next to you
here we say you broke if everybody is broke except for you
boss!
