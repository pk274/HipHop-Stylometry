how b.i.g. and un trust you in the studio with me
don't they know i'm tryin' to sex you continuously,
pull a high power coupe, make you jump ship
leave who you wit', run with the roc-a-fella crew
trick ya for the cheese, tear your boom up
spread a ill rumor, make you flip on lil' cease
twist you backwards, get the dough from your platinum hits
rock lil' kim hats and shit
i gets down and dirty for the dough
i got love and b.i.g. know it
he must got the studio bugged
probably, as we speak he's on his way up the street
with the m.a.f.i.a. thugs and all types of heat
but i ain't tryin' to beef, i'm just tryin' to eat
horizontally, the way i hold my iron, sweet
and, no, my niggas, but i like the sound
lil' kim and jigga, it sound like figures
