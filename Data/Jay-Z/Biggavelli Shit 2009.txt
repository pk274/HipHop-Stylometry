i'm from the streets where the hood could swallow 'em and
bullets'd follow 'em and
there's so much coke that you could run the slalom
and cops comb the shit top to bottom
and say that we are prone to violence, but it's home sweet home
where personalities clash and chrome meets chrome
the coke prices up and down like it's wall street, holmes
but this is worse than the dow jones, your brains are now blown
all over that brown brougham, one slip, you are now gone
welcome to hell, where you are welcome to sell
but when them shells come, you better return 'em
all scars, we earn 'em
all cars, we learn 'em like the back of our hand
we watch for cops hoppin' out the back of vans
wear a g on my chest, i don't need dapper dan
this ain't a sewn outfit, holmes, holmes is about it
was clappin' them flamers before i became famous
for playin' me, y'all shall forever remain nameless

i like six fours and thick hoes just look at the way she walks my shit grows
life is a bitch you know how the shit goes
