if you're havin' girl problems, i feel bad for you, son
i got 99 problems, but a bitch ain't one
i've got the rap patrol on the gat patrol
foes that wanna make sure my casket's closed (that bitch)
rap critics that say he's money, cash, hoes
(if it is tell her ease back)
i'm from the hood, stupid! what type of facts are those?
(she's a tramp and everybody sees that)
