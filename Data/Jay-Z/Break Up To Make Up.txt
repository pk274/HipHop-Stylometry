you and me, havin' sex
after an argument, that shit's the best
you and me, havin' sex, yeahh
after an argument, that shit's the best
(think about it while the streets you roam
it's dom p and army in the fridge when you get home)


i storm in, she storm out
it's like the war of the roses goin' on in my house
it's a little separation but i know how to fix the situation
mami just sufferin' from love deprivation
so i gotta give her thug reparations
put it in the life until love leg is shakin'
slow and passionate, 'til we forget what happens
then we laughin' and we back friends


you and me, havin' sex
after an argument, that shit's the best
you and me, havin' sex, yeahh
after an argument, that shit's the best
(think about it while the streets you roam
it's dom p and army in the fridge when you get home)


girlfriend didn't believe me when i said i'd be back in a little
'cause i had the crisp tee on with the crease in the middle
plus a fresh cut and the freezin' icicles
on my wrist, on my hand, that's when shit hit the fan
said, "you never spend time with me, what's up with that?"
translated it means  (hit it harder from the back)
yeah, she hid my car keys
and forced me to fall asleep to her heartbeat


sex so intense, all that's on my mind
it ain't feel this good since the very first time
i'm pullin' her close, she's pullin' away
i'm tryin' to kiss her mouth but she keeps turnin'' her face
cute sex game like our very first date
we ain't know each other well enough, we had to wait
but oh! i know just where your hot spot at
you can not deny that, so do not try that
i do not buy that..
