mannerisms of a young bobby deniro, spent spanish wisdoms
in a whip with dinero, crime organized like the pharoahe
i cream, i diamond gleam
high post like hakeem, got a lot of things to drop
brooklyn to queens, i gotta keep my steam
niggas wanna try to hem my long jeans
uptown fiend for jay-z to appear on the scene
in the meanwhile, here's something dope for y'all to lean
liaison for days on end
money make the world go around so i made some to spend
can i live, did dough with my nigs, dividends flow
like the mississippi riv', looking jig
can't do for dolo, had to turn away when tony killed manolo
that's real, mixed feelings like a mulatto
thug thought he was o.g. bobby johnson
i played him like benny blanco, mano a mano
you ain't ready, i fondle trigger straight up, shoot my guns
horizontal, get your weight up, i am
two point two pounds
you're barely a hundred and twenty five grams
wouldn't expect y'all to understand this money
do the knowledge, due to few dollars, i'm due to demolish
crews brooklyn through hollis to a hood near you, what the fuck?
