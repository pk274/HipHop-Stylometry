nickels and dimes, kilos and nines
can't stop the flow when all we know is crime


i got the formula to success: get yourself
a kilo from bobbito, then get yourself a couple of peoples
and we can make this work, never let them niggas try to jerk
if they do, put them in the dirt then murk
now, get your property some place, the howard d's
get yourself a couple of shorties that shoot a glock with ease
and let's start clocking g's, never let bobbito sell you flour
take a freeze, now it's time to flip 'em like micky d's
take your baking soda and your triple beam
not too much soda, gotta keep it potent enough to cripple fiends
and keep 'em running, coming back; keep your gun in lap
in case these niggas try to steal your crack, there'll be none of that
just lock it down like comstock nothing better ahk
don't ever sell a tray on my block you'll need the doc-
-tor, move fast to have a empty case
when you start seeing dough get that fire proof sentry safe

hustling 101 welcome to the class
you'll learn the art of dealing history and making broken english your math
i can't teach you how to stash, see myself i hold cash
every dollar like its my last, 'cause it might be
i stay away from hoochies that love gucci's and louis
vuitton - the don, before i spend: do me
before the sun rose we was out chasing dollars
with a couple of o's that follow downing bottles of ros√©, kid
and now we're celebrating living life 'cause hell can wait
first it was capsules, now its fish scales and selling weight
what about rapping, rappers always be asking
but while you was on promo tour i was at home laughing
stashing, staying in fashion, putting cash in
the fireproof sentry safe, kid we die for loot

slacking in the game, kid make it happen
cop some cracks and put yourself back on the map and
once your clientele's grooving without you nothing's moving
you got that shit they want, need, gotta have when they're using
this shit is deeper than the streets, we're working for the government
before they try to larry davis me we're going public
can't see my future from the street so i live for now
gotta get legit before they hear my name too much downtown
tryna be up out this shit soon as i start packing
every time i try to leave this game it pull me back in
a magnet to selling small white fragments
thick bags of it 'cause i never had shit
i gotta get mine regardless even if it means
putting my ass on the line like a trapeze artist
i gotta blow, watch for the smoke
that's all i know so that's all i wrote
out
