yeah, check
jigga murder tracks, let the rap flow kill ya
rock platinum jewelry, young ladies think it's silver
need a fix? hit me on the hip, but don't get berzerk and get whipped
put my buisness in the street like work
i rock rocky ices, duck po-lices
through your town run up and down like poppy prices
and through somethin', let me know - you wanna do somethin'?
i'll meet you by your building in a brand new somethin'
that's not a thing, i just copped a range
the 4-dot-6 with the hot wood grain
drop the front like hydaulics, got her hypnotic
like the dearly departed mr. christopher wallace
jigga got it if you need it (uh-huh)
willin' to give it if you willin' to live it, lovin' killin' the digits
it's the rap black sheep along with the blackstreet
we drop it monday and go platinum that week
