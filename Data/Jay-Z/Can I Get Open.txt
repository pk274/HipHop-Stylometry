yo t, can i get open? (you know it)
hey ski, can i get open? (you know it)
hey ya'll, can i get open? (you know it!!)
(you want a fly style jay's about to show it)


well, cause can i? is never a question of how but
when i rip it, will i quit it, forget it
still i'm always on point whenever i hit it
biting's forbidden, don't do what ya gonna... too late, y'all did it
i'm shredding the track, i'm burning you back-back, like back-draft
brothers who running the crack down i stutter, that-that nigga's fast
i pick up the pieces, i straighten it out like pete rock
or c is, or creases, it's your choice, jesus--christ
i'm nice like that, you freaking gay right
i flow like water, so put your finger in a dyke
i slam, i got original flavor, pick up the jam
i killed chico, and now it's just me- the man
go get your gun i go all out with a can
brothers is having a hard time with who i am
j kicking it, a ripping it, way past y
i'm so crraazzyy (ahhhhh)

jay-z: did i get open? (you know it)
tone hooker: hey ya'll did i get open? (you know it)
ski: hey ya'll did i get open? (you know it)
all: you know it, you know it, you know it
