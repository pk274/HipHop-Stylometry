compound, rocafella
and ne-yo is like young michael, i'm quincy ho
now hear the flow that broke the da vinci code
i'm psycho
everything i wrote go
together so nice
like a wedding, make you wanna throw rice
i'm schitzo
koo-koo clock don't tick so
write sometimes 'til the chicks noodles
i got screws loose
i pull words out the air like bluetooth
i'm a sandwich short of a picnic
ignorant thoughts come across you've sworn that i written this
but i didn't so maybe
it's good to be crazy
isn't it, baby?
