you in the presence of a king
scratch that, you in the presence of a god
put in the belly of the beast
i escaped, a nigga never had a job
scott boras, you over baby
robinson cano, you coming with me
these niggas like rotary phones
it's a new day, hit up kd
niggas always try to knock a nigga down
knock me to my knees about a million times
uncle said i'll never sell a million records
i sold a million records like a million times
these niggas shouldn't let me in
i ball so hard on espn
see my name come across on cnn
'bout 6 minutes, you gonna see it again
'bout 6 minutes, you gonna see me again


if fear is your only god
get y'all to fear me is my only job
crown, crown
crown, crown


bulletproof glass, glass roof like the pope
bulletproof love, niggas down since the yolk
bitch asked if i was god, fuck i'm supposed to say? no?
you already seen me turn a man to a g.o.a.t
you already know what i could do with the coke
dropped it in the water, made it disappear
i made it reappear, i had that bitch on a rope
i make my roof get ghost, bottom grill, i make my tooth get gold
all the shit i did, i wasn't supposed to live, hallelujah hov
wasn't for the 'caine wouldn't be able
wasn't for the bread, probably be dead
best friends become ya enemies, niggas' knives are double-edged
