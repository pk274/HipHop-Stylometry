the way i rock, no way you could stop
i stop, pop and drop when jay gets hot
when i'm in the zone, better hold ya own
'cause i like to break when i finish a poem
pound for p-p-pound the best around
no way you can get up when i get down
i shake, rattle and roll and wreck shit like none
and beat a nigga ass half silly on the one
fuckin' a! buckin' jay! ill with skill
so ladies, step up â€” i get around like a wheel
i'm never chokin' off chronic, skills are bionic
bitches are screamin' like onyx
respect that i peel a punk's cap back and sign it
creep through your block, fuck a glock, i step
through your neighborhood, armed with nothin' but a rep
i'm givin' these ladies somethin' they can feel 'cause i'm real
ya man get outta line, and it's kill-kill-kill-kill!
