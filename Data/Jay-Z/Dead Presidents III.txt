while others spit that wonderama shit
me and my conglomerate
same crime, bigger trial, your honor suck a dick
let me, live out my dreams until my heart give out
involved with cream, you know exactly what this is about
fuck y'all mean, handlin' since a teen
like lebron or sebastian, high school graduates
straight to the league, i ain't waitin' for my knee to blow
yesterday i was needin' this dough
get it? i was kneadin' this dough
long as your math is fast, if your readin' is slow
yo, my life ain't rosy but i roll with it
my mind was fine 'til the dough hit it
then told me that the mo' did it
and now it's kosher, shit is so hasidic
i blow a digit on the diamond at san trop√© visits
and won't miss it, so don't twist it
young is just as nice and more risks than '96, kid


d-p 3, yes!
washingtons go to wifey, you know how that go
jacksons go back then we cop us some mo'
the benjamins go in the stash box under the floor
i'm out for presidents to represent me, now you know
d-p 3, d-p 3


my boy sig said
he was on a tier where no tears can fall
'cause he was on the block where no squares get off
see in my inner circle, all we do is ball
'til we all got triangles on our wall
ain't just rapping for the platinum, y'all record
i recall, 'cause i've really been there before
never far behind, 'cause i think too forward
all about the grind like me so horny
warned you early on about my mindset
you thought it was an empty bomb threat
'til i flew into the building like 100 osamas
said to do a few millions
expose the world to a hustler's true feelings
i came into this game with nothing to prove
you'll never stop a nigga in that type of mood
so every move i make confuse the industry
i'm out for presidents to represent me
