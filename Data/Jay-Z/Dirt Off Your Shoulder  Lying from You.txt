if you feelin' like a pimp, nigga, go and brush your shoulders off (haha!)
ladies is pimps too, go and brush your shoulders off
niggas is crazy, baby, don't forget that boy told you
get that dirt off your shoulder (get, that)


i probably owe it to y'all, probably be locked by the force
tryin' to hustle some things that go with the porsche
feelin' no remorse, feelin' like my hand was forced
middle finger to the law, nigga, grippin' my balls
said the ladies, they love me (haha!)
from the bleachers they screamin'
all the ballers is bouncin', they like the way i be leanin'
all the rappers be hatin' off the track that i'm makin'
but all the hustlers, they love it, just to see one of us make it
came from the bottom of bottom, to the top of the pops
nigga, london, japan and i'm straight off the block
like a running back, get it? man, i'm straight off the block
i can run it back, nigga, 'cause i'm straight with the roc, c'mon


if you feelin' like a pimp, nigga, go and brush your shoulders off
ladies is pimps too, go and brush your shoulders off
niggas is crazy, baby, don't forget that boy told you
get that dirt off your shoulder
you gotta get that dirt off your shoulder
you gotta get that dirt off your shoulder
you gotta get that dirt off your shoulder
you gotta get that dirt off your shoulder


your homie hov' in position, in the kitchen with soda
i just whipped up a watch, tryin' to get me a rover
tryin' to stretch out the coca, like a wrestler, yessir
keep the heckler close, you know them smokers'll test ya
but, like, fifty-two cards went out, i'm through dealin'
now fifty-two bars come out, now you feel 'em
now fifty-two cars roll out, remove ceilin'
in case fifty-two broads come out, now you chillin'
with a boss, bitch, of course, s.c. on the sleeve
at the 40/40 club, espn on the screen
i paid a grip for the jeans, plus the slippers is clean
no chrome on the wheels, i'm a grown-up for real, chill


this isn't what i wanted to be
i never thought that what i said would have you running from me
like this, this isn't what i wanted to be
i never thought that what i said would have you running from me
like this, this isn't what i wanted to be
i never thought that what i said would have you running from me
like this, this isn't what i wanted to be (what i, to be)
i never thought that what i said would have you running from me (never, what i, would have, from me)
like this


you (no turning back now)
i wanna be pushed aside, so let me go
(nah, no turning back now)
let me take me back my life, i'd rather be all alone (uh, uh, yeah, uh!)
(no turning back now)
anywhere on my own, 'cause i can see (yeah, uh, yeah, yeah, yeah!)
(nah, no turning back now)
the very worst part of you, the very worst part of you (uh, yeah, uh, uh, uh!)
is me


biatch!
heh
