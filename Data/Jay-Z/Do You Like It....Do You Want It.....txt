picture me ballin' in the drop top, open skies
in somethin' foreign, soarin', 145
the god is callin' for my body, let my spirit fly
i want it all, uh, no lie
picture me pourin' poppin' somethin' imported
pedal floorin', clutch poppin', boppin' to lauryn
now picture me fallin'


picture me drivin' a course through your home, bustin' a "u"
screamin' at the top of my lungs "you fuckin' with who?"
picture me not bein' that hustler dude
picture the benz, a 5, and the drop not new
picture the watch ain't platinum, the rocks not blue
picture y'all niggas not knowin' how i do
picture me, better yet picture you
paintin' a better picture than the one that i drew


hold up, stop, wait, reverse the tape
how much money can one nigga make in one place?
how much dough could you hold in one safe?
how many hoes can a nigga really chase?


the sky's the limit, but i ain't done jumpin'
money is fast, but i ain't done runnin'
picture me drivin' some wack shit
picture me foldin' under pressure, picture that shit
