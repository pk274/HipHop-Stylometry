down under climax (bullz way, mista mister)
down under, huh, climax, huh, yeah


i keep my underwear up with a piecе of elastic
then hit you with a cinemast hit
my shinе lose your sight tryin to watch the watch
and my jeans will be off with the little skinnies
at least that's what it feels like when i pick you apart
you know you ghetto when you thinkin you a star
but you don't hear a word you see that slr
semi automatic no click click we don't feel you
i'm unusually loose in the movie role it true
get in where you fit in follow me ooh!
all the sudden magazines give me good reviews
the very spot you standin' in then is where i'll leave you
trials of a child everything truth
i'm in the studio everyday and i'm lettin 'em loose
the war to be a rap legend ha just begun
i'd rather die for a cause than to die just because
who else you gon' run with the truth is us
'cause we now the homeboy is in a safer and better place
we all trying to make it a better way
for i lack the company it needs to be entertained


i got a chemical romance two left feet (left feet)
but i jus' know that you meant me
and go for yours and say that you got it
i'm the truth tell it loud weed yellin': "aaah!!" (ah-haha)
found in the testaments resounding these sentiments (mmm)
'cause it's the funkadelic hit you with the irrelevant (huh)
the truth shall set you free just listen
i just snatched the jesus piece off some christians
'cause in just a little while i'll return to the dust (left in the dust)
the weapons will bust your best bet just step to the cut
the head rush will cause your cerebellum to bust
i'm a veteran with the mac-11, huh
i'm a veteran, oh
