uh, lies told to you, through youtubes and hulus
shows with no hues that look like you do
black twitter, what's that? when jack gets paid, do you?
for every one gucci, support two fubus
sippin' crip-a-cola consumer and a owner, uh
'til we all vertically integrated from the floor up
d'usse pourer, sip ace 'til i throw up
like gang signs 'cept i bang mines for both ya
serial entrepreneur, we on our own
stop sittin' around waitin' for folks to throw you a bone
if you can't buy the building at least stock the shelf (word)
then keep on stackin' 'til you stockin' for yourself, uh
see, everything you place after black
is too small a term to completely describe the act
black nation, black builder, black entrepreneur
you in the presence of black excellence and i'm on the board
lord lord, lord, lord, lord, lord
god, god, god, god, god
lord, yuh, god
