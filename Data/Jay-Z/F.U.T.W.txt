just let me be great
let me be great
i feel like mothafuckin' cassius clay right now
genius!
don't be good my nigga, be great
after that government cheese, we eating steak
after the projects, now we on estates
i'm from the bottom, i know you can relate

fuck up the world
just fuck up this world
fuck up the world


me and destiny got a date
martin had a dream, hov got a team
my chain already heavy, don't let me get a ring
parades down flatbush, confetti on my fur
turn right in rutland, niggas heavy on the curb
see most my niggas died early twenties or late teens
i'm just trying to come from under the thumb of this regime
1% of a billion more than niggas even seen
still they wanna act like it's an everyday thing, clean


fuck up this world
fuck up this world
fuck up this world
fuck up the, uhh


high yellow sky dweller and the rose gold
legend of the summer in the rose bowl
came through pasadena in the low-low
just to show respect to the cholos
feelin' like a stranger in my own land
got me feeling like brody in homeland
i just want a shot to show my genius
standing on the top hold my penis
america tried to emasculate the greats
murdered malcolm, gave cassius the shakes
wait, tell them rumble young man rumble
try to dim your lights tell you be humble
you know i'm gon' shine like a trillion watts
you know a nigga trill as michael jackson socks
sendin' light out to compton and the hundred blocks
lil bastard boy, basking on top


i fuck up this world
just fuck up this world
let's fuck up the world
fuck up the, uhh


sipping d'uss√© boy this ain't your daddy yak
he in a cadillac; me? i'm in the maybach
this ain't grey sweat suits and white tube socks
this is black leather pants and a pair of stance
socks is my synopsis is clear
got strip clubs feeling like oxford, i swear
teacher-teacher, i'm trying to unteach ya
all the shit they taught y'all, they got you all in the bleachers
when you front row at the knicks game, those the spike lees
you front row everywhere, you in the h.o.v.'s
jordan 1's and dungarees
and that's just the half of my warpath
make a million another million let my niggas make a million
'til we all check a billion, shit it's just the way i'm feeling
we have yet to see a ceiling, we just top what we top
cause the bars don't struggle when the struggle don't stop


just fuck up this world
