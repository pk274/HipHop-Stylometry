ha ha, ha ha
what.. '96 and forever
rok-a-blok, roc-a-fella
yeah, keep it realer than most
marcy, brooklyn... yeah

i keep it realer than most, i know you feeling it
cristal's on ice, i like to toast, i keep on spilling it
bone crushers i keep real close, i got the skill for this
on my back the flyest clothes, looking ill as shit
transactions illegitimate 'cause life is still a bitch
and then you die but for now, life, close your eyes and feel this dick
since diapers, had nothing to live for like them lifers but
making sure every nigga stay rich within my cipher
we paid the price to circle us, success, they turned my mic up
i'm 'bout to hit these niggas with some shit that'll light ya life up
if every nigga in your clique is rich, your clique is rugged
nobody will fall 'cause everyone will be each others crutches
i hope you fools choose to listen, i drop jewels, bust it
these are the rules i follow in my life, you gotta love it
jiggy-jigga looking gully in the joint
if y'all niggas ain't talking 'bout large money, what's the point?


even if it ain't sunny, hey, i ain't complaining
i'm in the rain doing a buck 40, hydroplaning, what, shorty?
(where you disappear to, son?) maintaining
putting myself in a position most of these rappers ain't in
i'm living, the ill streets' blues got you hunger pang-in'
nothing to gain and a whole lot to lose, you still singing, fool
i'm thorough, in every borough, my name be ringing
warming it up for the perfect time to hit your brain, and
ya feelin' it? to all the girls that bought a girdle to conceal my bricks
no doubt, they can vouch my life is real as shit
'95 south and papi on the hill and shit
and all the towns like cambridge that i killed with, shit
and all the thorough-ass niggas that i hustle with
throw your joints in the air one time and bust your shit
these fake rappers can't really know i'm loving it, you feeling it?


what, y'all ain't heard that nigga jay hot?
the cristals they keep me wet like baywatch
i keep it tight for all the nights my momma prayed i'd stop
said she had dreams that snipers hit me with a fatal shot
those nightmares, ma, those dreams that you say you've got
give me the chills but these mills, well, they make me hot
y'all don't feel me, enough to stop the illing right?
but at the same time these dimes keep me feeling tight
i'm so confused, okay i'm getting weeded now
i know i contradicted myself, look, i don't need that now
it's just once in a blue when there's nothing to do
and the tension gets too thick for my sober mind to cut through
i get to zoning: me and the chick on the island and then we're boning
i free my mind sometimes i hear myself moaning
take one more toke and i leave that weed alone, man
it got me going, shit
