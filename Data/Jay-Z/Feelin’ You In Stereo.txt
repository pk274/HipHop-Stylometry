everything ain't hardcore you know
i can't sing but my man
i'ma let my man smooth that thang out for you
you know, take the edge off, you know what i'm sayin'?


a melody is the chemistry, the way we click
it's like four part harmony and all that shit
your waistline is the bass line, i ride that shit
strung off your treble and i'm high as shit
we made love in the studio
when we got together over and over again like a loop (oh!)
damn i'm missin' you, it's hard to listen to
all these different dudes, huggin' and kissin' you, fuck!
