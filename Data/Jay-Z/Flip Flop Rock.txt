yeah
atlien style on y'all ass
do or die, aquemini
killer mike-roc-a-fella collaboration, holler (ugh, ugh, ugh, ugh)


when i'm in the mood, i rock the s. dot tennis shoes
as an interlude, i got the gucci flip-flops
and i fix it up like gin and juice when i'm in them interviews
dudes wanna know what he copped
and where you got that, and how could they buy that
"where the million-dollar watch at?" stop that
"why that? why this?" niggas wanna hijack the flyness
i'm on a whole 'nother plane (woo)
a whole different lane, a whole 'nother game that i'm playin' (ugh)
understand what i'm saying?
hov' and outkast, what you think about that?
really don't matter, though, what you niggas chatter, though
anybody get out of line, then you trust
that the mac'll go, "rrat" (rrat)
got you chilled for that alone
back on the shit, back on the strip
another hit, i'm not gon' miss
