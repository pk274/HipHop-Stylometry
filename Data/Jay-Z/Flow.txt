now, people have told me that in the business you've got the best flow. my problem is, i don't know what that means
ha, um, i say like...like, if you had-here-here's a melody

you got starch in your flow
i flow too many ways
got a arch in my flow
all songs are flow
rembrandt, rilke
i am art with the flow
even if i'm guilty
you gotta pardon the flow
niggas takin' me lightly
had to darken the flow
way i put it together
tear 'em apart with the flow
i'm too smart with the flow
you just started to flow
stop it youngin'
you 106 & park with the flow
