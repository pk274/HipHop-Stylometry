yeah, you know i'm full time trippin’

hov here to deliver you like moses, so it's
indisputable fact, we the chosen
throwin' roc nation brunches, that’s a feast for
non-believers, i created my own easter
evidence for your reverence
why would i not have a watch like a saudi prince?
it unfoils
the slave that shook hands and humbled the duke of oil
the spook that spoke sterling silver and pearls twirled, tumbled out my nappy coils
visions of sugar plums for all the boys and girls
why would i sell out? i'm already rich, don't make no sense
got more money than goodell, a whole nfl bench
did it one-handed like odell handcuffed to a jail
i would've stayed on the sidelines if they could've tackled the shit themselves
you backstabbers gon' turn me back to the old jay
he's not who you wanna see, he's not as sweet as the old ye
when i die, please don’t tweet about my death (death)
tryna get mentions, bringin’ attention to yourself (to ya)
please don't post some pic from in the club (club)

tryna get likes from my love
if you can’t go by the crib and give my mama a hug
