niggas couldn’t do nothing with me, they put the devil on me
i'd have preferred niggas to squeeze the metal on me
rumors of lucifer, i don’t know who to trust
whole world want my demise—turn the music up
hear me clearly: if y’all niggas fear me, just say y'all fear me
fuck all these fairytales
go to hell, this is god engineering
this is a hail mary pass, y’all interfering
he without sin shall cast the first stone
so y'all look in the mirror, double-check your appearance
bitch, i said i was amazing
not that i'm a mason
it’s amazing that i made it through the maze that i was in
lord forgive me, i never would've made it without sin
holy water, my face in the basin
diamonds in my rosary shows he forgave him
bitch, i'm red-hot
i'm on my third six, but a devil i'm not
my jesus-piece flooded
but thou shall not covet—keep your eyes off my cupboard
i'm a bad motherfucker, it's hov, just say you love it
