ho!
we got another one, phar-real!
dance
i call you "for real" (ooh) cause you the truth, haha
oh-woah
young, great hova (oh-oh)
uh (dance), yeah (ooh), let me talk to 'em
oh-woah
i'mma keep it real (oh-oh)


every time your name was brought up
i would act all nonchalant in front of an audience
like you was just another shorty i put the naughty on
but uh, truth be told
you threw me for a loop, this hov
i'm too old to be frontin' what i'm feelin', denzelin'
actin' like you ain't appealin' when you are
stuntin' like you ain't my only girl when you are
(i was just frontin')
i'm ready to stop when you are
