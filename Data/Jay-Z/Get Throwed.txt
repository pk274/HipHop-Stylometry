good weed, good drink, big money, mayne
(ayy!) (big money, mayne)
rollin' in somethin' foreign, on leather grippin' grain (we only ride the best) (yeeeah!)
i handle my business so i think i deserve to get throwed, throwed
(it's one and only big homie) (ayy)
(tried to told you i'm throwed) (ayy)
(ha) (yeeeah)


something foreign iâ€™m tourin' on foreign land
worldwide i'm known for the arm & ham-
-mer, per the streets, i'm a wanted man
(but the flow's like dope) so it's on again
started with the block, hit it brick by brick
then i charted with the roc nigga, hit by hit
i'm retarded with the glock nigga, clip by clip
the competition is none, they deceased to exist
let it breathe a little bit
he's off his rocker, he's a little schitz'
throwed like a football, hov used to cook raw
now i got the game sewn like granny's good shawl
sure, y'all niggas want war
y'all got it backwards, y'all should want raw
y'all should want more (and more, and more - uhh!)
