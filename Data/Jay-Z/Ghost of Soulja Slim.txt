next time they bring up the gods, you gon' respect us
that lil' vest ain't gonna do you, i shoot from neck up
i ain't even tryna hold ya, magnolia slim
i'm a soldier from that mode, i'm the ghost of him
from the era of police stretcher, no cameras catch it
drop you off in a rival hood, you rather be arrested
if you didn't have no straps, you couldn't wear your necklace
niggas hand around your throat, that's a choker reference
my ancestors took old food, made soul food
jim crow's a troll too, he stole the soul music
that's the blood that goes through me, so you assumin'
i could never sell my soul, they sold they soul to me
peaceful teaching of rumi, but don't confuse me
you mouth off for the cameras, i make a silent movie
now here's some jewelry
no civilization is conquered from the outside until it destroys itself from within
pen, put a pin in that, will come back when i fin
you can't talk like i talk 'cause you ain't been where i been, young


think of things i said that you hated then
empirical facts that can't be debated now
things you say today, i was sayin' then
tell us who your favorite now
