like to show out in public, throw tantrums on the floor
got to toss a couple dollars just to shut up her holla

baby girl so thorough, she been with me from the start
hid my drugs from the narcs, hid my guns by the parts
i got this model chick that don't cook or clean
but she dress her ass off and her walk is mean
only thing wrong with ma, she's always on the scene
goddamn, she's fine, but she parties all the time
i get frequent flier mileage from my stewardess chick
she look right in that tight blue dress, she's thick
she gives me extra pillows and seat-back love
so i had to introduce her to the mile high club
now that's young chick, stewardess, project, and model
that means i fly rough early, plus i know tae bo
that means i'm new-school, pop pills, and stay in beef
but i never have a problem with my first-class seat, i love

i got this african chick with eddie murphy on her skull
