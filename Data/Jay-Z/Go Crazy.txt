more than a hustler, i'm the definition of it
master chef, lord of the kitchen cupboard
more than a street legend, homie, it's hova
more than a relief pitcher, i'm the closer
the mariano of the mariott
if money talks, the whole world's 'bout to hear me out
see, i'm a hustler's hope, i'm not his pipe dreams
so when they speak of success, i'm what they might mean
attract money, my worst color is light green
my favorite hue is jay-z blue
don't follow me, young'un, follow my moves, i'm not a role model
my bad influence got the world drinking gold bottles
when puff was in that tub spilling mo'
i was at my video, cris' on the speedboat
in my lifetime, nigga, go through your research
st. thomas, my nigga, that was me first
chrome-shoe'd the gs, i came feet-first
in the game like a baby born to breech birth
i got the keys if you need work
i can kingpin you a line, a dime at a time
my niggas love it when i talk like this
my corporate people start bugging 'cause i talk like this
them corporate thugs is like "nah, hov', talk that shit
the dope boys go crazy when they hear that boy jay-z!"
see, i'ma '80s baby, mastered reaganomics
school of hard knocks, every day's college
you ain't did nothing i ain’t did, nigga, pay homage
or pay the doctor, - i spray llamas, still
the time'll reveal, you know i'm being honest
y'all ain’t pull my coat yet and i keep my shit in coat check
they say the truth shall come to the light
so everybody grab your shades, 'cause your boy that bright
goodnight!
