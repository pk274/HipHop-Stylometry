dot seventeen with the switch, it'll change you
mama always said you was an angel
papa got ghost but these doors, he never came through
he got ghost but those walls, he never came through
stain glass windows on the church, i hope they stain proof
'cause when the tides change, i'm tryna stain you (woo)
plottin' for revenge, dig your grave too
whatever you want engraved what your tombstone gon' say too
crosses on the head of an angel
sins of the father darken the doorstep, i became you
faithful to the end, woo, uh
bullets with your names drew, cock back, aim, shoot, bang
