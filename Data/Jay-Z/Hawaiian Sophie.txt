the luau was sharp, right jay? (on the strength money)
laughter good food and tons of honeys
eat and be merry, festive drums playing
a real cool atmosphere, you know what i'm saying?
tipped through the crowd, aloha aloha
mingled like a single, then yo i
stopped dead in my tracks, and my heart did freeze
eyes wide surprised to find sophie's
smiling at the jaz for some reason or other
clocking a brother, but standing with another
who just so happened to catch her expression
look in my direction as a sign of aggression
approaching me and yo i ain't lying
was this big coconut eating barefoot giant
face to face, i mean ,chest to face
my fist prepared to hook off in haste
then sophie sweeter than sugar a good looker
broke in between, before homeboy shook her
grabbed her took her away on the wild tip
on a macho trip, that ain't hip
look to my partner jay (yeah, i saw it)
shrugged his shoulders said (hey, i can't call it)
i said i think she should just up and go free
then i can be with a girl named sophie
