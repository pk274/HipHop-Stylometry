yeah
we're gonna do it like this
aight
let's go
jigga


boy, if i do
the things you want me to
uh-huh
the way i used to do
would you love me, baby
uh-huh
or leave me feeling used?
would you go and break my heart?


i'm all over ready
okay, cool, alright
she wanna shop with jay
play box with jay
she wanna pillow fight in the middle of the night
she wanna drive my benz with five of her friends
she wanna creep past the block, spying again
she wanna roll with jay, chase skeeos away
she wanna fight with lame chicks, blow my date
she wanna inspect the rest, kick me to the curb
if she find one strand of hair longer than hers
she want love in the jacuzzi, rub up in the movies
access to the old crib, keys to the newbie
she wanna answer the phone, tattoo her arm
that's when i gotta send her back to her moms
she calls me heartbreaker
when we apart, it makes her want a piece of paper
scribble down "i hate ya", but she knows she loves jay because
she loves everything jay say, jay does, and all


gimme your love
gimme your love
gimme your love
damn straight
gimme your love
that's a wrap
