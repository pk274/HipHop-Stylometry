arm, leg, leg, arm, head â€“ this is god body
knowledge, wisdom, freedom, understanding, we just want our equality
food, clothing, shelter, help a nigga find some peace
happiness for a gangsta, ain't no love in these streets
conspiracy theorist screaming illuminati
they can't believe this much skill is in the human body
he's 6'2", how the fuck he fit in a new bugatti?
aw, fuck it, you got me
question religion, question it all
question existence until them questions are solved
meanwhile this heretic, i be out in marrakesh
morocco smoking hashish with my fellowship
y'all dwell on devil shit, i'm in a diablo
yellow shit, color of jell-o shit
hello bitch, it's me again
fresh in my easter clothes feeling like jesus and


that's me in the corner, that's me in the spotlight
losing my religion, losing my religion


getting ghost in the ghost, can you see me? can you see me?
have mercy on a judas, angel wings on a 'ghini
i'm secular, tell the hecklers seckle down
y'all religion creates division like my maybach partition
and god is my chauffeur, boy they love hova
from the south side of chi to brooklyn where i growed up
i confess, god in the flesh
live among the serpents, turn arenas into churches
i'm like michael, recycle, these are not 16's
these are verses from the bible
tell that preacher he's a preacher, i'm a motherfuckin' prophet
smoke a tree of knowledge, drink from a gold chalice
you gotta love it, i arrive at the pearly gates
i had luggage, meaning i had baggage
niggas asking me questions, i don't answer to these busters
only god could judge us, motherfuckers, uh
