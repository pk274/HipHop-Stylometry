sky high with ty ty
g feezys with jay breezy
casa de campo with og
then i'm back home to my bey-bey
police escorts at the all star
and the super bowl, i don't need a horn
horn, beep beep, i'm too on
my niggas don't do traffic
how ironic, all we used to do is traffic
then it was drop me off at my girl's house
at one o'clock, pick me back up
you know she gon' try to train a nigga
before i step up in the club
would've drove my own v
she be tryna take a nigga's keys
she know them hoes be on a nigga
she ain't even tryin' let nigga leave
you just wanna be around them nasty bitches, she said
fuck them hoes, i'm just stuntin' with my niggas, he said
