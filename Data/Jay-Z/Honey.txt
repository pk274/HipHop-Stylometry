uhh.. uhh, it's the boy jay-z, and the boy r. kel
(it's, the best of both worlds)
the best of both worlds, (of both worlds) please believe it
brooklyn, chi-town, to all the beautiful ladies in the world (what)
it's dedicated to tt, my niece
everybody in the world, uhh, talk to 'em kel
(it's the best, of both worlds) that's right
tone, this is mean and vicious man, so mean and vicious
rockland, roc-a-fella (what?)
the best of both worlds (what?), come on


lord forgive me i'm ballin' out of control
got the spirit of a hustler pourin' out of my soul
mami i love you but ain't no stoppin' my stroll
if you wanna be down with me, you gotta rooolll
like a roll and if my side of the bed gets cold
you gotta know that i'm out chasin' doooough
i'm ain't stuntin' these hoes, stuntin' my growth
if i fuck 'em i'm fleein' them, i need somethin' to hold
then i'm home to you
i might roam like a cellular phone, but i never leave you alone, i
solemnly swear, i was married to the block before i met you
it's still a part of me there but i
solemnly swear, i try but it's in my blood
pumpin' yay, since i was yay high
i'm in love with the life
so accept me for the bastard that i am
you're still in love with me right?


baby girl had me off my grind, off my clock
i would often find i was off my block
couldn't keep her off my mind, my boys were shocked
they never thought that i'd pause or stop
was in my pores to push rock raw
take a lost rebound like bo outlaw, i'm so outlaw
got a hunger for this game, but keep that on the low
like a one against the grain, got the sun against my brain
a girl in my ear, i like her for her
i'm addicted to this shit, i like it like i like her
sometimes i can't figure it out
i'm in love with the life, but she's sticking it out
she know wanna hug kisses keep a nigga in the house
locked down while his niggas is out (out...)
