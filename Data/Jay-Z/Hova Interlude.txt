well, i'm the ghetto's answer to trump
i'm cancer to the hamptons
20 million a wop, ransackin' mansions
increase the noise pollution, as soon as i land in
don't even trust uppity white folks
keep the cannon tuck
niggas tryin' to lean on jay, shots gon' stand you up
glocks gon' pop, y'all not understandin' much
i hustle for the duckets
well, now i hustle for the rush, like fuck it baby
i just love it
chicks now say they like the way i thug it
since my album dropped, my stock grows like i went public
ladies i love y'all
but i love my freedom more
i love my niggas, love to see them ball
i love beans and bleek
them niggas like my peter and paul
my disciples, and that's right we comin' for the title...
do you believe? it's hova the god
