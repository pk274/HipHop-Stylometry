fuck y'all mad at me for?
y'all don't even know what i've been through
i played chicken with a mack truck
y'all motherfuckers woulda been moved
i swam waters with great whites
y'all motherfuckers woulda been chewed
i hustled with vultures late nights
y'all motherfuckers woulda been food
fuck wrong with these dudes? try to walk around in these shoes
see the shit i saw growing up
then maybe you could take a peek at these boos
niggas fantasize about the shit that i do daily
like these rappers rap about all the shit that i do really
i'm like, "really, half a billi,' nigga, really?" you got baby money
keep it real with niggas, niggas ain't got my lady money
watch the throne, don't step on our robe
bad enough we let you step on our globe
when my nephew died, daddy dead
nigga took the price on my uncle's head
nobody called the cops as my uncle bled
so i feel like i would like to know my uncle's bread
bow down, brother, pay homage
don't spill hate all on my garments
comme des gar√ßons, fuck yo' fresh
head shots, nigga, fuck your vest
fuck the pig, no pork on my fork
peace, god, 'cause you know a nigga just went


ham
hard as a motherfucker, let these niggas know who i am
yeah, i'm 'bout to go ham
hard as a motherfucker, let these niggas know who i am
yeah, i'm 'bout to go ham
