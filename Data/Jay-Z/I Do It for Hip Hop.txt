hip-hop, started out in the park
we used to do it to avoid the narcs
i used to do it so the homeboy clark
can get the fuck off my back while i knocked off these packs
i used to rap to impress my friends
to pass the time while i was gettin' it in
just so happens, i'm so illegal with the pen
they ain't want me doin' anything illegal again
i lost a lot of dogs to these streets
i got grammy awards on these beats
thank god for kool herc
without your shit i probably would've got murked
shout out to grandmaster flash and to caz
and even jaz bum-ass
hip-hop helped me wash my rocks
these other rappers couldn't wash my socks
that's why i took the number one slot
the realest shit in rap comes from my voice box
lord knows when i was on my clock
i prolly never woulda stopped, thank god for hip-hop


i don’t do for the cars and the fancy drops
uh, i do it for hip-hop
i do it for hip-hop
i do it for hip-hop
and i don’t do for the chains and the flashin’ rocks
come on, i do it for hip-hop
i do it for hip-hop
i do it for hip-hop
