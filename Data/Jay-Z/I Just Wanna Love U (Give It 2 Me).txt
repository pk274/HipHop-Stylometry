unstoppable (dynasty)
young hova


yeah, uhh, yeah

will i fuck 'em? will i diss 'em? that's what they be yellin'
i'm a pimp by blood, not relation
y'all be chasin', i replace them, huh?
drunk off cris', mami on e
can't keep her little model hands off me
both in the club, high, singing off key
"and i wish i never met her at all!"
it gets better, ordered another round
it's, about, to go, down
got six model chicks, six bottles of cris'
four belvederes, got weed everywhere
what do you say, me, you, and your chloe glasses (uh-huh)
go somewhere private where we can discuss fashion?
like, prada blouse, gucci bra (okay)
filth mart jeans, take that off


yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
yeah, save the narrative, you saving it for marriage
let's keep it real ma, you saving it for carats
you wanna see how far i'ma go
how much i'ma spend but you already know
zip, zero, stingy with dinero
might buy you cris', but that about it
might light your wrist, but that about it
fuck it, i might wife you and buy you nice whips
ma, but you really gotta ride nice dick
know how to work your hips and your head's priceless
profess you love to hov' and i'll never let you down
get you bling like the neptune sound
okay, hot hov', too hot to hold
ladies love me long time like 2pac's soul
only way to roll, jigga and two ladies
i'm too cold, motorola, two way page me (c'mon)


yeah, yeah, yeah
same song, i'm back, been around the world
ro-mancin' girls that dance with girls
from, club cheetah to club amnesia
the peanuts in l.a., bubblin' in dublin
can't deny me
why would you want to? you need me
why don't you try me?
baby, you want to, believe me (hov'!)


uh, that, that, that, that, uh, huh, uhh
