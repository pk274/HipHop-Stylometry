uhh, uhh
uhh, uhh, uhh, uhh, what
hah, what, how real is this?
uhh, uhh, how real is this?
what? uhh, what?
uhh


we push the hottest v's, peel fast
through the city, play monopoly with real cash
me and biggie and the models be shakin' they sadiddy ass
and prada be somethin' you cats got to see
and the watches be all types and shapes of stones
bein' broke is childish and i'm quite grown
run up in the club with the ice on, me and paisan
scope the spot out, see somethin' nice and i'm gone
you cats is home screamin' the fight's on
i'm in the fifteen hundred seats, watchin' tyson
same night, same fight
but one of us cats ain't playin' right, i let you tell it
people place yourselves in the shoes of two felons
and tell me you won't ball every chance you get
and any chance you hit, we live for the moment
makes sense, don't it? now make dollars
cats pop bottles, bone chicks that favor idalis
and rack up frequent flight mileage


miraculous, pockets stay full
niggas skip the bull 'cause we matadors
snatch the p89s that we pack in the drawers
and we clap the doors of your acuras
snap like, cameras on amateurs
make you all dance, hold a hammer to yours
jig and big rock ice, no cracks or flaws
everybody got a part to play, back to yours
run up in your crib now, crack your doors
watch the real players live, it's a habit to floss
play the charts like the beatles, y'all adapt you lost
and toast cristal on behalf of y'all
too bad for y'all
ain't too many as bad as yours truly
do we, we laugh at y'all
little bastards y'all
