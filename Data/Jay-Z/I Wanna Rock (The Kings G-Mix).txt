hold up, i wanna rock right now
my name is hov and i came to shake the town
yeah, your boy's internationally known
but i'm from the hood, got a pocket full of stones
i used to cop "rob base", turn it into "ez rock"
just to stay "doug e. fresh", all that shit to easy rock
used to "chef" raekwon, give fiends a "ghostface"
y'all know my "forte", i just might catch a dope case
i "mastered" the "p"
with connects in the midwest, so i'm "heavy" in the "d"
your boy still "snoop" around
since a pup, i been "kurupt" and i fuck with tha dogg pound
ugh! roc nation is the gang now
some dope lyrics is the only thing i slang now
i "get the job done", i put the "kane" down
it's no "biggie" - heh, i'm just a king now
