damn girl, you a wave
got these niggas next level hatin', matchmakin' from the grave, are y'all okay?
hmm, lovers don't finally meet, they been in each other all along
so way before you were born, and long after they're gone, this ain't no song (song)
hmm, life don't taste the same without you, tears in my champagne 'bout you
quit playin' girl, you know i'm crazy 'bout you
you know that week you ran back to your momma house, ask my friends, they can vouch (ooh)
slept on the couch, 'cause the bed ain't a bed without you
luther songs looped up in my head
love you for my life, and i put that on my dead
put that on my daddy's newport cigarettes
he blew cancer rings, i got toxic traits
look who coaxed the ghost out my body, got me straight
i don't want no smoke
baby girl, you fire
can't end up like my folks, nah
