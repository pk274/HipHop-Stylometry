come on... life... death...
here... gone... yo


if i should die, don't cry, my niggas
just ride, my niggas, bust bullets in the sky, my niggas
and when i'm gone don't mourn, my niggas
get on, my niggas
when it's real say word to shawn, my niggas
if i should die...


don't cry, my niggas, it's been one hell of a ride, my niggas
in the middle of the drought, i flipped pies, my niggas
i did joints with mary j. blige, my niggas
i've eluded the coppers, got booted with big poppa
skated through with the caesar picadas
at high school got head by the lockers
gassed the baddest girl in the class to show me her knockers
rocked jewels, dropped school, still didn't fail
rhymes still written well, hold court in the street
never sit in the cell for a second then i'm gettin' my bail
shoot it out with the bounty hunters
fuck sittin' in the county for summers if they should down me
everybody around us become one for that day
to live life get your shit right and play
don't get it twisted like braids, if i'm missed it's okay
but life's short, don't miss a day, uhh


if i should die, don't cry, my niggas
just ride, my niggas, bust bullets in the sky, my niggas
and when i'm gone don't mourn, my niggas
get on, my niggas
when it's real say word to shawn, my niggas
if i should die...


... don't cry, my niggas
just ride, my niggas, bust bullets in the sky, my niggas
and when i'm gone don't mourn, my niggas
get on, my niggas
when it's real say word to shawn, my niggas
if i should die...


i'd tell big they're still hearin' his songs
run into pac ask him where we went wrong
tell him life is miserable when ya dealin' in the physical form
is everything that's invisible gone?
i need to know, will i still feel pain or will it be ironic?
will i chill in the flames for all the ills of my brain?
can i re, veal the game to all the hustlers
trapped in the race and if so can i leave this place?
can i puff cigars and drink cristal?
if this is heaven to me is this considered heavenly?
can i still touch lives, answer their "whats and whys"
make sure everybody in my fam' clutch five?
if i should die... don't cry, my niggas
