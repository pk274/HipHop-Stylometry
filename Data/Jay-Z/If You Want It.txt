(jay-z: what the fuck)


roc-a-fella gang, suit up
stay fly from the boot up
like, computer
till you die get you're loot up
do what you like, it's still in me
when assets become liability's
back to dealing g's
but feeling these
to bomb like lebanese
forever cheese
i'm dead stain to blow and lit like gas lane(?)
vast game, live out my life like a movie
till the last rain, blasting the ooze, till i'm woozy
gordo at $12.99 a cd
jay-z & tone hooker is ???
blasting in the auto
the crystal got me thinking about more though
watch out girl, if i needed
i can't be stopped, won't be defeated
i come to take you're shit you gotta leave it
if i want it i got the guns for it player run it
ready to die, roc-a-fella style for a couple of hundreds
fowl, nothing less than six digits out my mouth (uh-huh)
if i ain't platinum soon then it's back down south (say what)
ill built like whatever y'all i'm back on the set
came to claim what i left because my name still rep
even though, player ain't been seen, been on the low
except on the screen (uh), tryna blow up my flow
it's an all out thing, no time to front
we make it happen, yeah we go it locked down
fuck y'all want






for all y'all laughing dudes
trying to knock this get money music


yeah, we talking 'bout
getting this cake and what not
but i'll tell you what
what ever heads you know, struggling
and ain't trying to get money
you keep them cats away from me
you understand, ha
