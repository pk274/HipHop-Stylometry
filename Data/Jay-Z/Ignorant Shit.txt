ugh, ugh, yessir!
just the sound of his voice is a hit, hehe
y'all niggas got me really confused out there
i make "big pimpin'" or "give it 2 me," one of those, y'all hail me as the greatest writer of the 21st century
i make some thought-provoking shit, y'all question whether he fallin' off
i'ma really confuse y'all on this one
follow!


when them tops come down, chicks' tops come down
like when them shots come out, make cops come around
when them blocks come out, i can wake up a small town
finish off the block, then i make my mall rounds
stares get exchanged, then the fifth come out
the tough guy disappear, then the bitch come out
"that's him!"—i'm usually what they whisper 'bout
either what chick he with, or his chip amount
'cause i been doin' this since chips was out
watchin' erik estrada, baggin' up at the ramada
table full of powder, a/c broke
'bout to take another shower on my 25th hour
spike lees everywhere, game or the flight
you might see me anywhere, a day in the life
only thing changed the tail number on the flight
i can touch down and take off the same night
i'm so bossy, bitch, get off me
trick, get off me, you can't get shit off me
i'm so flossy, no sixes on sprees
laid-back, maybachs, don't even talk to me


this is that ignorant shit you like
nigga, fuck, shit, ass, bitch, trick, plus ice, c'mon
i got that ignorant shit you love
nigga, fuck, shit, maricón, puta, and drugs, c'mon
i got that ignorant shit you need
nigga, fuck, shit, ass, bitch, trick, plus weed, c'mon
i'm only tryna give you what you want
nigga, fuck, shit, ass, bitch, you like it—don't front!


they're all actors
lookin' at themselves in the mirror backwards
can't even face themselves
don't fear no rappers, they're all weirdos, de niros in practice
so don't believe everything your earlobe captures
it's mostly backwards, unless it happens to be as accurate as me
and everything said in song, you happen to see
then, actually, believe half of what you see
none of what you hear, even if it's spat by me
and with that said, i will kill niggas dead
cut niggas short, give you wheels for legs
i'm a k-i-double-l-e-r, see y'all in hell
shoot niggas straight through the er, whoa!
this ain't b.r., no
it's s.c., ceo, the next lyor
no, the next leader of the whole free world
and the first thing i'ma do is free sigel—go!


i missed the part when it stopped bein' 'bout imus
what do my lyrics got to do with this shit?
scarface the movie did more than scarface the rapper to me
still that ain't to blame for all the shit that's happened to me
are you saying what i'm spittin'
is worse than these celebutantes showin' they kitten? you kiddin'?
let's stop the bullshittin'
'til we all without sin, let's quit the pulpittin'
scarface the movie did more than scarface the rapper to me
still that ain't to blame for all the shit that's happened to me
let's stop the bullshittin'
'til we all without sin, let's quit the pulpittin', c'mon


this is that ignorant shit you like
nigga, fuck, shit, ass, bitch, trick, plus ice, c'mon
i got that ignorant shit you love
nigga, fuck, shit, maricón, puta, and drugs, c'mon
i got that ignorant shit you need
