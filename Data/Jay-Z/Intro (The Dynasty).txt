the theme song to the sopranos
plays in the key of life on my mental piano
got a strange way of seeing life, like
i'm stevie wonder with beads under the do-rag
intuition is there, even when my vision's impaired, yeah
knowing i can go just switching a spare
on the highway of life, nigga, it's sharp in my sight, oh!
keen senses ever since i was a teen on the benches
every time somebody like ennis was mentioned
i would turn green—me, being in the trenches
him, living adventurous, not worrying about expenditures
i'm braving temperatures below zero, no hero
no father figure; you gotta pardon a nigga
but i'm starving, my niggas, and the weight loss in my figure
is starting to darken my heart, 'bout to get to my liver
watch it, my niggas; i'm trying to be calm but i'm gon' get richer
through any means with that thing that malcolm palmed in the picture
never read the qu'ran or islamic scriptures
only psalms i read was on the arms of my niggas
tattooed, so i carry on like i'm nonreligious
clap whoever stand between shawn and figures
niggas say it's the dawn, but i'm superstitious
shit is as dark as it's been, nothing has gone as you predicted
i move with biscuits, stop the heart of niggas acting too suspicious
this is food for thought—you do the dishes!
