uh, yo don't get mad at me
i don't love 'em, i fuck 'em
i don't chase 'em, i duck 'em
i replace 'em with another one
you had to see she keep calling me b.i.g
and my name is jay-z
she be all on my dick
gradually i'm taking over your bitch
coming over your shit
got my feet up on you sofa, man
i eat a hostess from her open hand
you coming home to dishes and empty soda cans
i got your bitch in my rover man
i never kiss her, i never hold her hand
in fact i diss her i'm a bolder man
i'ma pimp her, it's over man
(it's over man, it's over man...)


yo, yo, why you home alone, why she out with me?
room 112, hotel balcony
how she say jay you can call the house for me?
there's no respect at all
you betta check her dawg
she keep beggin' me to hit it raw
so she can have my kids and say it was yours
how foul is she? and you wifed her
shit, i put the rubber on tighter
sent her home, when she entered home
you hugged her up
what the fuck is up?
she got you whipped, got your kids
got your home, but that's not your bitch
you share that girl, don't let 'em hear that he'll hurl
it'll make 'em sick that his favorite chick
ain't saving it, unfaithful bitch


cool out homie
you betta keep her away from my balling clique
keep her out of nightclubs all in the mix
from hanging out with chicks who be swallowing dicks
from cats who order cris' play the floor with the knicks
it can only lead to something unfortunate
hot boy like jigga man scorch your bitch
play the four dot, jigga man go first
then we all rock 'til we all hot
you know the boy from the roc got them whores on lock
got the bitches in the smash
make them drawers drop fast
'cause we get more cash than the average nigga?
all them hoes like "damn, i gotta have this nigga"
'cause i'ma hot black, how in the hell can you stop that?
you would fuck mine
how the hell can you knock that?
i'm just playing the cards choosenly
jigga man, who you supposed to be?
