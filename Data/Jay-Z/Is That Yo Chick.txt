memph bleek do it again
jigga man, yeah
(yeah, yeah)
missy, sho' nuff


uh, yo don't get mad at me
i don't love 'em i fuck 'em
i don't chase 'em i duck 'em
i replace 'em with another one
you had to see she keep calling me big
(and another one!)
and my name is jay-z
she be all on my dick
gradually i'm taking over your bitch
coming over your shit
got my feet up on you sofas, man
i mean a hostess for my open hand
you coming home to dishes and empty soda cans
i got your bitch in my rover man
i never kiss her, i never hold her hand
in fact i diss her i'm a bolder man
i'mma pimp her, it's over man
when i twist her in the gold sedan
like i'm goldie man, you've been chosen man
jigga man, ice burg with the frozen hands
wedding bands don't make it rosey man
