fo' shizzle, my nizzle, used to dribble down in va
was herbing 'em in the home of the terrapins
got it dirt cheap for them
plus if they was short with cheese i would work with them
brought in weed, got rid of that dirt for them
wasn't-born-hustlers, i was birthing 'em
h to the izz-o, v to the izz-a
for sheezy, my neezy, keep my arms so breezy
can't leave rap alone, the game needs me
haters want me clapped in chrome, it ain't easy
cops want to knock me, d.a. wanna box me in
but somehow, i beat them charges like rocky
h to the izz-o, v to the izz-a
not guilty, he who does not feel me
is not real to me, therefore he doesn't exist
so poof! vamoose, son of a bitch

h to the izz-o, v to the izz-a
not guilty, y'all got to feel me
