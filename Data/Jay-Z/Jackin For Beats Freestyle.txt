woo
bring 'em out, bring 'em out, bring 'em out, bring 'em out
it's hard to yell when the bar-rels in your mouth
bring 'em out, bring 'em out
bring 'em out, bring 'em out
bring 'em ou—, bring 'em ou—
bring 'em out, bring 'em out


bring the choppers out
if i feel like it's a threat, it ain't shit to talk about
i don't lollygag, i let my money talk, it's bilingual
like a sensei, i feel like master roshi, i can teach you how to ball
shit, i guess i'm really more like a trainer
doggy time didn't last long, danny granger
wear it out the store, baby, you can keep the hanger
you can hit up danny if you tryna make a banger
call on tyrone, buffed up just like deebo
pull up to the function lookin' like i sold a kilo
somebody call disney 'cause my pockets stuffed with lilo
shittyboyz, i bet you cannot name a better trio
hold on, look
my money look like legos 'cause i stack it to the ceilin' (bring 'em out, bring 'em out)
you the realest niggas there if i ain't in the buildin' (bring 'em out, bring 'em out)
i be out here grindin' thinking 'bout my kids' children (bring 'em out, bring 'em out)
bitch, you ain't aaliyah thinkin' you one in a million (bring 'em out, bring 'em out)
