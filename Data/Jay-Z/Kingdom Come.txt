i don't know what life will be in h.i.p. h.o.p
without the boy h.o.v
not only n.y.c. i'm hip hop's savior
so after this flow you might owe me a favor
when kingdom come, you ready?
when kingdom come, i'm ready
when kingdom come i'm ready


now everywhere i go they like hov come back
up out the corner office out the cul-de-sac
where's iceberg slim he was the coldest cat
get your swag back daddy where your focus at
got to admit a little bit i was sick of rap
but despite that the boy is back
and i'm so evolved i'm so involved
i'm showing growth, i'm so in charge
i'm ceo and yeah glory to god
i'm so indebted, i should have been deaded
selling blow in the park, this i know in my heart
now i'm so enlightened i might glow in the dark
i been up in the office you might know him as clark
but, just when you thought the whole world fell apart
i, take off the blazer, loosen up the tie
step inside the booth, superman is alive


the king of new york, new york
not only n.y.c., i'm hip hop's savior
so after this flow you might owe me a favor
when kingdom come, you ready?
when kingdom come, uh huh
not only n.y.c., i'm hip hop's savior
so after this flow you might owe me a favor


i hear "hurry up hov'" when i'm out in the public
'cause niggas like: "but you love it; you be it, you're of it
you breathe it, we need it; bring it back to the hustlas"
had to dust off the hammer dance, can't touch this
c'mon playboys, bring the cars back out
'cause ya boy hov is back, you know them broads coming out
got 'em dancing on the banquette, like they from bankhead
fuck cristal, so they ask me what we drinkin'
i thought dude's remark was rude okay
so i moved on to dom, krug ros√©
and it's much bigger issues in the world, i know
but i first had to take care of the world i know
i'm from the bottom, so i still feel 'em from the bottom
underdog before my cape, still couldn't stop him
flash gordon when recording, spark the light in the dark
peter park', spider-man, all i do is climb the charts


the king of new york, new york
not only n.y.c., i'm hip hop's savior
so after this flow you might owe me a favor
when kingdom come, you ready?
when kingdom come, uh huh
not only n.y.c., i'm hip hop's savior

just when they thought it was all over
i put the whole world on my back and broad shoulders
the war-hova, but who you know took over tracks like that
guess what new york, new york - we back
and i ain't never been afraid of a drought
since i was six, seventeen been getting money down south
bout it, bout it, master p
ask the nigga pimp c, ask my homie bun b
i run the streets the streets don't run we
y'all run, we chill still waters run deep
i repeat, sing along with me
i run the streets, the streets don't run we
ladies saying "where you been superman?"
when niggas spending ten million in media on my hands
the bruce wayne of the game have no fear
when you need me just throw your roc signs in the air, yeah!
