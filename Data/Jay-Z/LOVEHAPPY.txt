happily in love, haters please forgive me
i let my wife write the will, i pray my children outlive me
i give my daughter my custom dresses, she gon' be litty
vintage pieces by the time she hit the city, yeah-ah
vintage frames, i see nobody fuckin' wit' him
pretty thug, out the third ward, hit me
sir acts just like his dad, shit is trippy (uh-huh)
twinning, blue and rumi, me and solo how fitting
(happy in love)
sitting, dock of the bay wit' a big yacht
sippin' yamazaki on the rocks
he went to jared, i went to jar out in paris
yeah, you fucked up the first stone, we had to get remarried
yo, chill man! we keepin' it real with these people, right?
lucky i ain't kill you when i met that b- (nah, aight, aight)
y'all know how i met her, we broke up and got back together
to get her back, i had to sweat her
y'all could make up with a bag, i had to change the weather (uhh)
move the whole family west, but it's whatever
in a glass house still throwing stones
hova, beysus, watch the thrones
(happy in love)


no more clubs and cali-curfews (one night)
just private affairs in a tighter circle
large format wines in small settings, woo
just hood ass niggas in designer suits (ooh)
follow my moves on a truth in ala√Øa boots, yeah, yeah
amelia earhart, flyer than who? (yeah, yeah)
fake news y'all choose, we no lie
no photoshop, just real life
(happy in love)
