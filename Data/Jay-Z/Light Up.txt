who would've thought i'd be caught in this life?
let's celebrate with a toast and get lost in tonight
and make it all light up
(ay guru tell, tell homegirl to open that ace right there...)
wait until the sun goes down
we gon' make this bitch light up
even when the sun goes down i'ma make it go


oww, hoes turn they heads like owls
i'm the man of the hour
triple entendre, don't even ask me how
con edison flow, i'm connected to a higher power
bright lights'll make your whole city light up
a trillion-watt light bulb when i'm in the night club
i just landed in that g450
caught the mayweather fight 'cause the satellite was crispy, uhh
y'all can miss me with the money talk
the smart money's on hov', fuck what the dummies talk, uhh
i don't do too much bloggin'
i just run the town, i don't do too much joggin'
mm, i ain't got a scar yet
'cause you fuckin' around with me and my dogs is far-fetched
drake, here's how they gon' come at you
with silly rap feuds, tryin' to distract you
in disguise, in the form of a favor
the barzini meeting, watch for the traitors, uhh
i done seen it all, done it all
that's why none of these dum-dums could done him off
the summer's ours, the winter too
top down in the winter, that's what winners do
and to these niggas i'm like windows 7
you let them tell it, they swear that they invented you
and since no good deed go unpunished
i'm not as cool with niggas as i once was
i once was cool as the fonz was
but these bright lights turned me to a monster
sorry, mama, i promised it wouldn't change me
but i would have went insane had i remained the same me
fuck niggas! bitches, too!
all i got is this money â€” this'll do
