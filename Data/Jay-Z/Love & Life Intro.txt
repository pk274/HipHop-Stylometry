who better to usher you back through the gutter
than america's number one hustler (it's young, fucka!)
don't call it a come back
unless there's some money attached to that
and you can call it whatever you like, in fact
it's something like a phenomenon
like i'm a young lebron, gettin' my high school games on
tv just for dunkin' on
whoever want it with shawn
we can get it jumpin' like donkey kong
we could get it thumpin' like bum-ba-bum
travel the way of the gun, come on, c-come on
no, i'm not only beggin' i'm eggin' you on
until you dead or gone that's the vendetta i'm on
this ain't no video game with wrestlers on it
the competitor on this is on some shit
honest, come through all black like a amish (woo!)
holsters under the armpit, the arm spit, ha
it's just that brooklyn don shit
along with the queen from yonkers
come on kiss the ring, 'fore i let miss mary sing
exposed to you her soul into everything, yeah
it's classic material
i see you bastards at the burial
jay go first and then mary go, round
i just ride, hold her down with the fifth by my side
me and miss blige
look up in the sky, it's a bird of that 'caine
and the hydro flow that i brought to the game
i could go mo' but i'ma let ma do her thang
brooklyn, we did it again
