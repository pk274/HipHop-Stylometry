niggas wanted to kill me and y'all still with 'em
nigga, y'all chill with 'em, and y'all wonder why we not friends?
best thing i can do is not build with you
when i could destroy you, that takes some fuckin' discipline
i could send a team to come drill you
i got a billion or two and i know where the fuck you live
niggas gotta chill with talking gangsta
you should just thank us, humble yourselves a little bit
this ain't the same shawn that you knew once
i don't shine shoes, uh, this ain't what you want, no
all that back and forth on the internet
nigga, we don't tennis that, y'all gotta do something, yeah
only thing we 'spect now is violence
anything besides this, we playing violins, uh
i'm public enemy
niggas wanted to kill me and y'all want me to be friendly
niggas want sympathy after they wanted to end me
be those closest to it be the very ones that envy
shout out to the family
i don't want no friends no more, not many understand me
everybody want something
you know the price of everything but the value of nothing
but everybody want something
you know the price of everything but the value of nothing
