lucifer-lucifer, son of the morning, i'm gonna chase you out of earth (kanyeezy, you did it again, you a genius, ****)

lord forgive him, he got them dark forces in him
but he also got a righteous cause for sinning
them-a-murder me, so i gotta murder them first
emergency, doctors performing procedures (lucifer-lucifer)
jesus, i ain't trying to be facetious, but
"vengeance is mine" sayeth the lord, you said it better than all
leave niggas on death's door, breathing on
respirators for killing my best boy, haters (lucifer-lucifer, son of the morning)
on permanent hiatus as i skate
in the maybach benz, flyer than sanaa lathan (lucifer-lucifer, son of the morning)
bumping "brown sugar" by d'angelo
in los angeles, like an evangelist (lucifer-lucifer)
i can introduce you to your maker
bring you closer to nature, ashes after they cremate you bastards
hope you been reading your psalms and chapters
paying your tithe, being good catholics, i'm coming
