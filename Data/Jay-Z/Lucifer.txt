kanyeezy you did it again, you a genius, nigga!


lucifer, son of the morning! i'm gonna chase you out of earth
(i'm from the murder capital, where we murder for capital)
lucifer, son of the morning! i'm gonna chase you out of earth
(so you need to change your attitude 'fore they asking what happened to you)


lord forgive him, he got them dark forces in him
but he also got a righteous cause for sinning
them-a-murder me, so i gotta murder them first
emergency, doctors performing procedures
jesus, i ain't trying to be facetious, but
"vengeance is mine" sayeth the lord, you said it better than all
leave niggas on death's door, breathing on
respirators for killing my best boy, haters
on permanent hiatus as i skate
in the maybach benz, flyer than sanaa lathan
pumping "brown sugar" by d'angelo
in los angeles, like an evangelist
i can introduce you to your maker
bring you closer to nature, ashes after they cremate you bastards
hope you been reading your psalms and chapters
paying your tithe, being good catholics, i'm coming


lucifer, lucifer, son of the morning! i'm gonna chase you out of earth
(i'm from the murder capital, where we murder for capital)
lucifer, lucifer, son of the morning! i'm gonna chase you out of earth
(so you need to change your attitude 'fore they asking what happened to you)


yes, this is holy war, i wet y'all all with the holy water
spray from the heckler-koch automatic
all the static, shall cease to exist
like a sabbatical, i throw couple at you, take six!
spread love, to all of my dead thugs
i pour out a little louis, 'till i head above
yessir, and when i perish, the meek shall inherit the earth
'til that time, it's on and popping, church
like don bishop, the fifth or palm cock either
lift up your soul or give you the holy ghost
please i leave you in somebody's cathedral for stunting like evel knievel
i'll let you see where that bright light leads you
the more you talk, the more you irking us
the more you gon' need memorial services
the black album, second verse, is like
devil's pie, save some dessert for us


man, i gotta get my soul right
i gotta get these devils out my life
these cowards gonna make a nigga ride
they won't be happy 'til somebody die
oh man, i gotta get my soul right
'fore i'm locked up for my whole life
every time it seems it's alright
somebody want they soul to rise
i chase you off of this earth
(let me get serious for y'all, one second)


i got dreams of holding a nine milla to bob's killer
asking him "why?" as my eyes fill up
these days i can't wake up with a dry pillow
gone but not forgotten, homes i still feel ya
so, curse the day that birthed the bastard
who caused your church mass, reverse the crash
reverse the blast then reverse the car
reverse the day and there you are, bobalob
lord forgive him, we all have sinned
but bob's a good dude, please let him in
and if you feel in my heart that i long for revenge
please blame it on the son of the morning, thanks again
