how you say my love in spanish? (mi amor)
(how you say my love in thug) can i hit it raw?
in the backseat of my jeep, or maybe on the floor
(easy papi) nah mami, teach me more
(tr'teme especial means treat me special)
i ain't got no time for that now, dame un beso
(wanna keep a good girl like i told you before)
(easy papi) yeah, teach me more


i like fast cars, i love faster chicks
you don't need a small waist, i take ass and tits
love chicks that deep throat, love bein left alone
on a sunday afternoon with the remote
love havin my cake plus eatin it too
shit, i got cake what the fuck i'm 'posed to do
like chicks to dress, but i love a good shoe
sophisticated mama with love for the hood too
love sexin girls on that boricua shit
love black girls that's when the levi's fit
chicks that play hard to get on that aaliyah shit
if at first i don't succeed, then believe i split
can you blame me? young buck, dirty-ass pops trained me
moms allowed it, daddy was about it (bout it)
game got inherited
mama said if you find love you better cherish it
teach me!
