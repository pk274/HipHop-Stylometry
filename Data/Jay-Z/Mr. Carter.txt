hey, mr. carter (young! i am him)
tell me, where have you been?
around the world now i'm back again
cause they've been asking, they've been searching
who's been askin' about me?
they've been wondering why (in case you wonderin')

i'm right here in my chair with my crown and my dear
queen b, as i share, mic time with my heir
young carter, go farther, go further, go harder
is that not why we came? and if not, then why bother?
show no mercy in murcielagos
i'm far from bein' the bastard that marcy had fathered
now my name's been mentioned with the martyrs
the biggies and the pacs and the marleys and the marcuses
garvey; got me a molotov-cocktail flow
even if you box well, can't stop the blows
kaboom! the roc boy in the room
the dope boy i just came off the spoon
also, i'm so fly i'm on auto-
pilot, while guys just stare at my wardrobe
i see euros, that's right: plural
i took so much change from this rap game, it's your go
(hey mr. carter) young!
