niggas is dead! dead, i tell you!
can't be serious
what you think's gon' happen with three of the illest niggas together in street music, and so forth, on one track, huh?
can't be serious
it's murda, nigga
huh? it's murda!


motherfuckers wanna kill me, but don't got the heart
to look me in the eyes with the nine and spark
'cause whether you're for or against this
when i spit with murderous intentions, everybody goes, everybody knows
the weapons i possess? they not for show
and you put dresses on your weapons when you walk out the door
see, once i flash, motherfuckers better do the one-shot dash or be one shot ass
j to the a-y to the—
drive by to your hood, screaming "bye-bye" to you
why would you fuck with me knowing i put you—
six feet deep and them niggas could die with you?
cock the hot pistol, then pop the hot pistol
and i promise you only one thing: i will not miss you
jay-hova, know the god that served ya
'cause dead or alive, when i arrive, it's murda!
