oh baby
hahahaha
turn the motherfuckin' music up


that's right, it's what i do!
c'mon, uh-huh
nah, you know i never let you down!
gyeah, gyeah, yuh


yo, first, i snatched the streets, then i snatched the charts
first, i had they ear, now i have they heart
rappers came and went, i've been here from the start
i seen them put it together, watched them take it apart
seen the rovers roll up with ribbons
i seen them re-po'd, re-sold, then re-driven
so when i reload, he holds number one position
when you hot, i'm hot
and when your feet cold, mines is sizzling
it's plain to see, niggas can't fuck with me
'cause i'ma be that nigga for life
this is not an image, this is god-given
this is hard-livin', mixed with cristal sippin'
it's the most consistent, hov
give you the most hits you can fit inside a whole disc and
nigga, i'm home on these charts, y'all niggas visitin'
it's hov tradition, jeff gordon of rap
i'm back to claim pole position, holla at ya boy


who else you know been hot this long?
(oh, yeah, we ain't finished)
started from nothing but he got this strong
(the roc is in the building)
built the roc from a pebble, peddled rock before i met you
pedaled bikes, got my nephews pedal bikes because they special (wooooo)
let you tell it, man, i'm falling
well, somebody must have caught him
'cause every fourth quarter, i like to mike jordan 'em
number one albums, what i got? like four of them
more of them on the way, the eighth wonder on the way
clear the way, i'm here to stay
y'all can save the chitter chat, this and that
dissin' jay, dissin' jay'll get you maced
when i start spitting them lyrics, niggas get very religious
six hail marys, 'please, father forgive us'
young, the archbishop, the pope john paul of y'all niggas
the way y'all all follow jigga
hov's a living legend and i'll tell you why
everybody wanna be hov and hov's still alive
