tears on the mausoleum floor
blood stains the colosseum doors
lies on the lips of a priest
thanksgiving disguised as a feast
rolling in the rolls-royce corniche
only the doctors got this, i'm hiding from police
cocaine seats
all white like i got the whole thing bleached
drug dealer chic
i'm wondering if a thug's prayers reach
is pius pious 'cause god loves pious?
socrates asked whose bias do y'all seek?
all for plato, screech
i'm out here balling, i know y'all hear my sneaks
jesus was a carpenter, yeezy laid beats
hova flow the holy ghost, get the hell up out your seats
preach
