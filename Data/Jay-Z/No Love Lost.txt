people know me on these streets and the towns i been through
lookin' at me, stay focused, i'm givin' 'em straight focus
surprise, what i do is already legalized
analyze how i floss across
of course there ain't no love lost


fo' sho', everything's for dough now
the flow, y'all gotta pay a little mo' now
it's platinum, nowadays we put the gold down
we stepped it up, y'all don't ever wanna showdown
get wetted up by the sleeve that leave the bezel out
y'all don't like it, sue me, i'll settled out
ghettoed out, in the vehicle bent
these days i mellowed out
see, success make a fella content
un huh, you know, this rap star, papi chulo
jay-z hugo, course playa, you lost playa
i know you rappers wanna see me fail
but quicker see a six-hundred s.l. b-12
live with it
y'all got dough to get get it, i got mine
your little bit of money couldn't stop mine
your block time too high, too many hands in your pie
seventy thirty, the n**** you work for, work for me
bottom line
