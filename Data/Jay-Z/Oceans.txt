(you see this motherfucking face)
blessings, blessings, yeah, i see..


dope boy still smelling like cocaina
white boat, white robe, can he be more cleaner?
the oil spill that bp ain't clean up
i'm anti-santa maria
only christopher we acknowledge is wallace
i don't even like washingtons in my pocket
black card go hard when i'm shopping
boat docked in front of herm√®s picking cotton
silk and fleeces, lay on my jesus
oh my god, i hope y'all don't get seasick
see me in shit you never saw
if it wasn't for these pictures they wouldn't see me at all
aww, whole world's in awe
i crash through glass ceilings, i break through closed doors
i'm on the ocean, i'm in heaven
yachting, ocean 11


me and ty ty is like pablo and popeye
winding dirt roads on mopeds spilling opus
welcome to the magnum opus, the magna carta
the best-selling author decoded
on the holiday playin' "strange fruit"
if i'ma make it to a billi, i can't take the same route
swoosh, that's the sound of the border
swoosh, and that's the sound of a baller
muhammad hovi my back against the rope
the black maybach, i'm back inside the boat
shepard fairey they finally gave me some hope
can't believe they got a nigga to vote
democrat? nope, i sold dope
in trouble waters i had to learn how to float
on the ocean, i'm in heaven
yachting, ocean 11
