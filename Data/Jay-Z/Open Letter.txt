i done turned havana to atlanta
guayabera shirts and bandanas
every time you think they got me i switch the planner
bulletproof this, radio scanners
(you got scanners, we got scanners)
balling 'til they ban us
you getting too much bread, they try to jam you
boy from the hood but got white house clearance
sorry y'all, i don't agree with y'all parents
politicians never did shit for me
except lie to me, distort history
wanna give me jail time and a fine
fine, let me commit a real crime
i might buy a kilo for chief keef
out of spite, i just might flood these streets
hear the freedom in my speech
got an onion from universal, read it and weep
would've brought the nets to brooklyn for free
except i made millions off it, you fuckin' dweeb
i still own the building, i'm still keeping my seat
y'all buy that bullshit, you'd better keep y'all receipt
obama said "chill, you gonna get me impeached"
but you don't need this shit anyway, chill with me on the beach


uh, y'all must want to start a revolution
you know whenever i'm threatened, i start shooting (bang!)
catch a body, head to houston
i'm in cuba, i love cubans
this communist talk is so confusing
when it's from china, the very mic that i'm using
idiot wind, the bob dylan of rap music
you're an idiot, baby, you should become a student
oh, you gonna learn today
where the fuck have you been
the world's under new management
the new role model, fuck this zoolander shit
