yeah, it's that knock right here
you fuck around not have the right speakers in your system
your shit be soundin' like this {*funny sounds*}
big thangs, thick chains, ain't shit changed
get brain in the four-dot-six range
shit mane, switch lanes
every town i hit, switch lames, bitch flip big 'caine


i givin' 'em whiplash when i'm whippin' the whip fast
which one? pick one nigga, i got a sick stash
continental t's, no tints like i got a thick stack
big cigar, old money, when i drop it it's so funny
six-four switches, slam doors on 6's
big trucks when i wanna fuck and it's time to get ass
i turn automobiles to hotels on wheels
i got money for a room, it's just the fact that i'm trill
bitches love when i cruise up the boulevard
they have contests to guess which car i'ma pull out the yard
they know i, come for dolo and pull off with a broad
spin away, spend a day tryin to pull menage
just mackin' this gorgeous; sunlight hit the ice it's flawless
run lights like i'm the king of new york, i'm lawless
bitches, they wanna hang like plaques in the office
'cause i push black porsches, benz's and jaguars-es
when the rag's off it, gat on my lap, i'm that cautious
never trust grimy-ass new yorkers
'specially when you're sittin on 20's they get nauseous
standin' in the azure with white air forces
