boy meets girl, girl perfect woman
girl get to bustin' before the cops come running
chuck the deuces, chugging d'uss√©, ugh
fuck what you say, boys in blue say


i'm an outlaw, got an outlaw chick
bumping 2pac, on my outlaw shit
matching tats, this ink don't come off
even if rings come off, if things ring off
my nails get dirty, my past ain't pretty
my lady is, my mercedes is
my baby momma harder than a lot of you niggas
keep it 100, hit the lottery niggas
you ain't about that life ain't gotta lie to me, nigga
you know it's till the death, i hope it's obvi to niggas
ugh
cross the line, speak about mine
i'ma wave this tec, i'm a geek about mine
touch a nigga where his rib at, i click clack
push your mothafuckin' wig back, i did that
i been wilding since a juvi, she was a good girl
'til she knew me, now she is in the drop bustin' uey's, screaming


deeper than words, beyond right
die for your love, beyond life
sweet as a jesus piece, beyond ice
blind me baby with your neon lights
ray bans on, police in sight
oh, what a beautiful death, let's both wear white
if you go to heaven and they bring me to hell
just sneak out and meet me, bring a box of l's
she fell in love with the bad guy, the bad guy
what you doing with them rap guys, them rap guys
they ain't see potential in me girl, but you see it
if it's me and you against the world, then so be it
