ohhhhhhhhhhh, i like the party life! (break out the red lights) (welcome to the party life)
the big city in bright light (welcome to the 70's)
the pretty girl dressed in the skintight (sweeeet)


ordered some patreezy, while talking to this breezy
brushing off my three-piece, i make this look too easy
so tall and lanky, my suit, it should thank me
i make it look good to be this hood, meyer lansky
mixed with lucky lefty, gangster effortlessly
papa was a rolling stone, it's in my an-ces-try
i'm in a whole 'nother league, niggas never catch me
and i sport fly shit, i should win the espy


i'm on the bra strap, she's on my dick
ain't nothing wrong with that, that's my biiitch!
i be the boss of that, i'm on her shit
so all you niggas fall back, i'll split ya wiiig
she's my little quarterback, ya dig
'cause i'm all that in the sack, yeah, ya dig
i spoiled her, foiled it if you faking jack
she's used to million dollar vacations
fuck y'all gon' do with that?


(is you rolling, rolling, rolling?)
yeah, baby, is you rolling?
head into the party life
you can stall out or ball out
(is you rolling, rolling, rolling?)
make a choice
(​​​​​​​​heading-heading to the party life)
it's so gangster, baby


sipping on my vino got me cooler than pacino
and de niro put together my real life is like casino
they should pay me for some b-roll
taking g-strolls through the ghee-tto
when rap-pap-pap-pid fire's just a necessary evil
hola ho-vi-to, cooler than ze-ro
be-low, fresh one blade, no chemo
art with no easel, please it's no equal
your boy's off the wall these other niggas is tito


step into my bedroom, i, call it the red room
'cau-cause it gets hot hot hot hot...
i trust you gon' like it ; see, why are we talking all this fly shit?
'cau-cau-cau-cau-cau-cause i'm the flyest
hovito, baby, no equal, baby
sold perico, beat the rico, now i'm leg-al ba-by
hovito, baby, no equal, baby
sold perico, beat the rico, now can we go crazy
