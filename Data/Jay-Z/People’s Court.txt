jigga, vol. 2 bitch
yeah
fuck judge wapner, it's jigga
ya heard?
y'all niggas in violation of the "player hating code"
session 1001


yo, i gives a fuck if you traum'd up, dom perignon'ed up
niggas from where want what?
one slip'll get your cherry bombed up, i got heavy arm
and my niggas homicide and deadly calm in the cut
b, test your dumb blonde luck, fuck with the wrong one
shawn gub harm one, two, fuck y'all wan' do?
bastards, niggas know i blast quick
as if y'all had to ask, shit, get your ass twist
it's the rap's el ni√±o, get your brain splitted (ugh)
and i don't like pussy well enough to hang with it
you ain't with it, same shidd-it
they can't fuck with the languaddage
soon as the slang's spitted, if you came you get it
plain as a game with them thangs with it
on co-sign and the whole nine
leave you where i find yo ass, lost with no sign (ugh)
you're so wrong, i'm the last nigga to roll on
got a vest on, went to folsom
when you guess wrong i'ma press one, motherfucker


fuck the judge, fuck the jury, when you're warring with me
it's people's court, we hold court in the street
i gives a fuck about the d.a
when you see jay, better crawl for your heat
it's people's court, we hold court in the street, ya heard me?
fuck the judge, fuck the jury, when you're warring with me
it's people's court, we hold court in the street
i gives a shit about the plaintiff
nigga, dangerous, watch your language with me
it's people's court, we hold court in the street


i give a shit if it's small claims, like stealing your bitch
or if it's supreme court,i lke stealing your bricks (haha)
look, my guns is all-range, more pain
indifferent to whether you're big money or small change
when i cock it, ballgame!
my pistals never miss-trial, here's the determent
with no chance of parole, bullets coming concurrent (boo-ka, boo-ka, boo-ka)
i'm like "why, nigga? try jigga" you must remember
it's like being on trial for your life with a public defender
let the jury fill the seats up, and start the court calendar off
with docket number 9mm, all rise, the honorable jay-z presides
instead of a mallet, i hold a tool, all objections over-ruled
save your opening arguments, hope you understanding
two guns, right over left, that's how i cross-examine
like tom cruise, pop 'em with the top gun, you lose
jigga's no lie, and y'all can't handle the truth


fuck the judge, fuck the jury, when you're warring with me
it's people's court, we hold court in the street
i gives a fuck about the d.a
when you see jay, better crawl for your heat
it's people's court, we hold court in the street, ya heard me?
fuck the judge, fuck the jury, when you're warring with me
it's people's court, we hold court in the street
i gives a shit about the plaintiff
nigga, dangerous, watch your language with me
it's people's court, we hold court in the street, g-g-g-g-g-geah!


no flow's sicker, no cell can hold jigga
since i dropped reasonable doubt, no coke can convict us
no contest in a rhyme-fest, i'm best
under oath raise my right hand, and i spit it (honest)
know your facts for real, 'fore y'all decide to act ill
when you blow trial ain't no coming back on the pill
it's murder one, bail set at a half a mil'
it's murder one, for you backwards motherfuckers: red-rum
commit hate crimes; fake rhymes, i hold in contempt
you get state time for faking like you greater than him
so cop a plea to lesser charges
pay your fine at the desk sergeant (ugh, uh-huh)
say you're sorry, then take your property
i be sho' defended, flow splendid, no co-defendant
while you niggas hold trial with no motions in it
three-time felon, third album, locking it down for the term
of lifetime, vol. 2, nigga, court is adjourned


fuck the judge, fuck the jury, when you're warring with me
it's people's court, we hold court in the street
i gives a fuck about the d.a
when you see jay, better crawl for your heat
it's people's court, we hold court in the street, ya heard me?
fuck the judge, fuck the jury, when you're warring with me
