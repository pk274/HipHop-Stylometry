jiggaman ya heard?
if you a playa, when you pull up to the curb
niggas chicks fly to the coupe when you pull up to them birds
why the fuck would you bring her
when the rocks on that man got his whole hand lookin like et's finger
if you a playa, keep your cars with the year (year)
your watch game tight (tight) your hustle over there (uh-huh)
your house outta sight, your enemies close
and your family tight and never try to make a ho your housewife
