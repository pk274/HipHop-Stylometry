we don't engage in war, we elope
orange juice style, beat niggas to a pulp
we broke, nigga you just told 3 jokes
me, biggs, and dame we get some things
see the six? dame's
me and biggs live in the range
mine's platinum, his champagne
niggas whisper 'cause they talk? they gets slain
y'all's was looking for me on the charts, the bricks came
left the same night in the morning, the chicks came
i just use rap to put shit in my name
the death's just a matter of time the hit's been arranged
contracts signed, the shits in your name
listen lame rap niggas, i'm the king
motherfuck the ring, mami kiss the chain
i don't got game to waste on y'all
i don't think with my dick or chase my balls
i'm a hustla, hit me with an eighth of raw
and when i get on top, i'ma blaze all y'all
keep 'em laced some more, i know you want some things
i drink a lot of water, mami come clean
chicks i pump her then dump her
cars we got 'em bumper to bumper
rap niggas, y'all days are numbered
nobody drop nothin' next summer, yeah

you about to witness a dynasty like no other
beanie sigel, the general
amil-lion, diana ross of the roc
memph bleek, young god
