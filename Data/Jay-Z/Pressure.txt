it's my life (my life)
everything i do i do for you (i do it all for you)
everything i say, you know it's the truth (i'll say it is the truth)
i'll take all the pressure off of you (take pressure off of you)
unh!
i'll take (young!) the pressure off of you
unh!


so the pen is mightier than the sword, my lord
my first picture was a line-up, now i'm on the forbes (unh)
and i still remain the artiste through thees all
if you force my hand, i'll be forced to draw (hahaha)
if the war calls for warhols
hope you got enough space on your hall's walls
i make niggas murals, then escape the bureau's investigation
out in europe on vacation
i'm back for these puppies with the pound, boy (rrrrra!)
here's a round, boy (rrrra! rrrra!), down, boy
sound boy, you don't wanna sound-clash; loud noise
leave niggas paranoid if not paralyzed
which means you can't walk in my shoes
too much green; you can't talk in my hue
extend the team, nigga, holla at lu'
1st and 15th, that's my cue
i'm through
