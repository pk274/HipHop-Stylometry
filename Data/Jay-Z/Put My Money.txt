naw, i don't fuck around, stay on my j.o.-
hov' been about that dough since i was a day old
oh, push perico if i need to for the root of evil
was born in the belly: that's the way the streets breed you
one life to live - notice you get no sequel
so i truly got to live this like my last movie
6 oohie, jewels dripping, big tooly
i ball for real: y'all niggas is sam bowie
and with the third pick, i made the earth sick
m.j., him jay, fade-away, perfect
i rhyme sicker than every rhyme-spitter
every crime-nigga that rhyme or touch a mic
because my mind's quicker
i'm a '88er, 9-6 to "reasonable doubt"
temper short; don't take much to squeeze you out
yeah you shining, but the only thing you're leaving out
you're a candle in the sun - that shit don't even out
