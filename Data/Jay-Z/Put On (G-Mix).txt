'ey guru, put a lil' t-pain on my shit too
clear my throat, know what i mean? uh
i put on... g-mix
i don't need no t-pain, i got this one
(oh you bout to put on hov?) yes


i put marcy on the map, i put brooklyn on my back
i put fab back on the charts, i put biggie in my raps
i put nas with def jam, i let diddy do my tracks
i put on for my city, that's a motherfucking fact
i put mike jack' on stage at summer jam, "billie jean"
i put prodigy in his place on that summer jam screen
i put preme in my truck told him leave them streets alone
i predicted jail would happen, shit, i tried to put him on
all these niggas taking credit for the work that i put in
if you really put me on, put yourself on then
i put miles on that hooptie, i put hours in that kitchen
put that on my "dear mama" this is fact not fiction
feds were trying to build a case, i was headed for conviction
til the greatest flow in the world put me on television
i put on for my city so when i'm dead and gone
i got one last wish: put my yankee hat on
