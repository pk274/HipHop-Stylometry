got the hottest chick in the game wearing my chain
that's right, hov!

check it out


real niggas respect it, fake niggas want beef
'cause they know that's the only way we ever gon' speak
we never gon' see eye to eye
your type of real, i don't recognize, it's all televised
mobsters opt to not get in beef
there's no business in it, it only brings police
wankstas want beef and they name in the street
most time end up with they brain where they feet should go
you should know if you gon' do somethin'
and you go to radio, we all know you frontin'
they shootin', nobody dyin'
somebody better put somebody body on somebody iron
sometime soon or somebody lyin'
i ain't buyin' that shit y'all shovelin'
i ain't duckin' for nothin', cousin
i'm too tall to act small, you liars


a'ight, that's enough, i'm done
