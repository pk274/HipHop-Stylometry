we don't complain that's just how it be
i shuffle back against the ropes like ali
i hustle through the alley, through the valley of death
and i never play fair in the eyes of the ref
fuck it, give me a tech and i'll come back right
can't throw us out the game, you ain't got enough strikes
come at me wrong i'll come at you the same
come at me sideways, i'll come blasting your brains
come at me indirect and i'll come back wit names
i'm hot like boiling water, i'll come back wit caine


we keep it raw & uncut for all the niggas and hoes
the first time you sniff it, it might hurt your nose
but only the strong survive and thats how life goes
thas just the life we chose
we keep it raw & uncut for all the niggas and hoes
and the first time you sniff it, it might hurt your nose
but only the strong survive and thats how life goes
but nigga this is the life you chose ya heard me


i use to catch that train and snatch that chain (uh-huh)
do anything for a game to catch some change
whether it was shooting the dice or clapping the gauge
i was a nigga wit a strong arm like satchel paige
i'm telling you dawg i'm the wrong one to fuck wit at all (that's right)
i'm the type that'll set a broad day in the mall
whether glocks or body shots, you taking a fall
fuck you cops, swats, feds and all
no no no homie i didn't say i could hit you wit 30 0's
what i said is i can supply you with 30 of those
and your thing thing homie, come holla at the kingpin
then dodge the rico, the carters is lethal
hang with psychotic people who life so fucked
niggas came up singing that god was evil
slang heroin to cats who like revolving the needle
and i blew to the point i bought cars for the p.o
what!
