real niggas do real things
hanging with the honeys is the song i sing
real niggas do real things
on the road to riches and diamond rings
real niggas do real things
bustin' my toast off the roof, drinkin' 90 proof 'til spring
real niggas do real things, check


we started out makin', small time bacon
two little niggas bakin', talkin' 'bout whippin' cakes
get clothin' and big cheddar, hopin it gets better
we had no knowledge of this shit we just was with whatever
in front of your building clockin', thought i was makin' a killin'
right in front of your children, eight-ball in my side pocket
they was corrupt too, disrespectin' the fiends i used to
look up to, take it or leave it, fuck you
in different parts of the planet, oakland to new york
i'm hollerin' lifetimes, he hollerin' life's too $hort
parallel lives and jew-els held high
the range or the rove, get exchanged, for your soul
you know how the game goes, slang to get cheese
and speak in chinese, everybody gains the same dough
get your shit scarred fuckin' with my sick squad
from marcy, to the bay y'all, we get large, bee-eeyee-otch


on the road to riches and diamond rings
real niggas do real things
hangin' with the honies is the song i sing
real niggas do real things
on the road to riches and diamond rings
real niggas do real things
bustin' my toast off the roof, drinkin' 90 proof 'til spring
real niggas do real things


on the road to riches and diamond rings
real niggas do real things
hangin' with the honies is the song i sing
real niggas do real things
on the road to riches and diamond rings
real niggas do real things
bustin' my toast off the roof, drinkin' 90 proof 'til spring
real niggas do real things


that's right, i been a hustler for a long time
always got the right beats, never sayin' wrong rhymes
i started off with nothin' ended up with everything
now we sip hennessy in first class on every plane
ask jay-z, he know what i'm sayin'
always see me at the bank and yes i'm goin' again
there ain't no dollar amount, that can make me happy
fine women, a big house, a truck and a caddy (that's right)


now peep, how sweet, niggas lives can get
put beef aside, the east and westside connect
$hort dawg, and jigga with the, fo'-fo' flow
i got love for y'all motherfuckers y'all just don't know
i know y'all got a thing for them rag six-fo's
i like the five speed drops pop the clutch then go
if you're ballin', keep ballin', if you jealous, stop
i want biggie to rest in peace, as well as 'pac
how real is that?


on the road to riches and diamond rings
real niggas do real things
hangin' with the honies is the song i sing
