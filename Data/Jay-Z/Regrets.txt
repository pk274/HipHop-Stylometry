stress...
sunshine, shade, geyeah


i sold it all, from crack to opium
in third person, i don't wanna see 'em
so i'm rehearsin' with my peoples how to g 'em
from a remote location in the bm
scopin' the whole situation, like, "damn!"
metamorphic, as the dope turns to cream
but one of these buyers got eyes like a korean
it's difficult to read 'em
the windows to his soul were half closed, i put the key in
pulled off slow, hopin' my people fleein'
chink tried to knock the only link that tied me in
coppers was watchin' us through nighttime binoculars
this time they got us on tape, exchangin' dope for dollars
make me wanna holler back at the crib in the sauna
prayin' my people bailed out like time warner
awaitin' a call, from his kin, not the coroner
phone in my hand, nervous confined to a corner
beads of sweat, second thoughts on my mind
how can i ease the stress and learn to live with these regrets?
(this time, stress, givin' this shit up, fuck)


this is the number one rule for your set

in order to survive, got to learn to live with regrets
if through our travels we get separated, never forget

as sure as this earth is turnin', souls burnin'
in search of higher learnin', turnin' in every direction, seekin' direction
my mom's cryin', because her insides are dyin'
her son tryin' her patience, keep her heart racin'
a million beats a minute, i know i push you to your limit
but it's this game love, i'm caught up all in it
they make it so you can't prevent it
never give it, you gotta take it, can't fake it, i keep it authentic
my hand got this pistol shakin'
'cause i sense danger like camp crystal lake and
don't wanna shoot him, but i got him trapped within this infrared dot
about to hot him and hit rock bottom
no answers to these trick questions, no time, shit's stressin'
my life found i got to live for the right now
time waits for no man, can't turn back the hands
once it's too late, got to learn to live with regrets


you used to hold me, told me that i was the best
anything in this world i want i could possess
all that made me want is all that i could get
in order to survive, got to learn to live with regrets
(when i was young) you used to hold me
told me i was the best
anything in this world i want i could possess
all that made me want is all that i could get
in order to survive, got to learn to live with regrets

i found myself reminiscin', remember this one?
when he was here he was crazy nice with his, son
i miss him, long as i'm livin' he's livin' through memories
he's there to kill all my suicidal tendencies
in heaven lookin' over me, or in hell keepin' it cozy
i'm comin', life on these streets ain't what it's supposed to be
remember newton, mutual friend? well, me and him feudin'
on your life i tried to talk to him
but you know niggas, think they guns can stop four niggas
frontin' like they're big willie but really owe niggas
hoe niggas, this year i'll show niggas â€” think i'm slippin'?
i'm about to send you a roommate, no bullshittin'
but my hustle's goin' too well to hit him
you was right, niggas want you to be miserable with them
anyway, i ain't tryin' to hear it, i think i'm touched
this whole verse i been talkin' to your spirit a little too much
