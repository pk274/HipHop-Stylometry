motherfuckers say that i'm foolish, i only talk about jewels (bling-bling)
do you fools listen to music or do you just skim through it?
see, i'm influenced by the ghetto you ruined
the same dude you gave nothin', i made somethin' doin'
what i do through and through and
i give you the news with a twist, it's just his ghetto point of view
the renegade, you been afraid i penetrate pop culture
bring 'em a lot closer to the block where they pop toasters
and they live with they moms, got dropped roadsters
from botched robberies, niggas crouched over
mami's knocked up 'cause she wasn't watched over
knocked down by some clown
when child support knocked, "no, he's not around"
now, how that sound to ya? jot it down
i bring you through the ghetto without ridin' 'round
hidin' down, duckin' strays from frustrated youths stuck in they ways
just read a magazine that fucked up my day
how you rate music that thugs with nothin' relate to it?
i help them see they way through it, not you
can't step in my pants, can't walk in my shoes
bet everything you worth, you'll lose your tie and your shirt

renegade, never been afraid to say
what's on my mind at any given time of day
'cause i'm a renegade
never been afraid to talk about anything
(anything?), anything (anything)
renegade, never been afraid to say
what's on my mind at any given time of day
'cause i'm a renegade
never been afraid to holler about anything
(anything?), anything (anything)


i had to hustle, my back to the wall, ashy knuckles
pockets filled with a lotta lint, not a cent
gotta vent, lotta innocent lives lost on the project bench
what you hollerin'? gotta pay rent, bring dollars in
by the bodega, iron under my coat, feelin' braver
durag wrappin' my waves up, pockets full of hope
do not step to me
i'm awkward, i box lefty
an orphan, my pops left me
and often my mama wasn't home
could not stress to me, i wasn't grown
'specially on nights i brought somethin' home to quiet the stomach rumblings
my demeanor thirty years my senior
my childhood didn't mean much, only raisin' green up
raisin' my fingers to critics, raisin' my head to the sky
big, i did it, multi before i die
no lie, just know i chose my own fate
i drove by the fork in the road and went straight
