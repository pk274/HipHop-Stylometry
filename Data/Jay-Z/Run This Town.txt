it's crazy how you can go from bein' joe blow
to everybody on your dick; no homo
i bought my whole family whips; no volvos
next time i’m in church: please, no photos
police escorts, everybody passports
this the life that everybody ask for
this the fast life, we are on a crash course
what you think i rap for, to push a fuckin' rav 4?
but i know that if i stay stunting
all these girls only gon' want one thing
i can spend my whole life good will hunting
only good gon' come is this good when i'm cumming
she got a ass that'll swallow up a g-string
and up top, ungh, two bee stings
and i'm beasting off the riesling
and my nigga just made it out the precinct
we give a damn about the drama that your dude bring
i'm just tryin' to change the color on your mood ring
reebok, baby, you need to try some new things
have you ever had shoes without shoe strings?
"what's that, ye?" "baby, these heels"
"is that a may— what?!" "baby, these wheels"
you trippin' when you ain't sippin', have a refill
you feelin' like you runnin', huh? now you know how we feel (what’s up?)
