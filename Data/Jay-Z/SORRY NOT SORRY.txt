nah, that's a triple b, can't forget 'bout the other bey (hey)
it's the white gloves for me
hater know not to touch me, i'm with the fuckery (fuck with me)
humbly (humbly), nah, respectfully
i'm a project baby, fuck y'all expect from me? (technically)
'merica's disrespect for me
you killed christ, you created religion, unexpectedly
circular ice on japanese whiskey, on my mezzanine
overlookin' the city of angels, the angel investor in things
unprecedented run (facts)
everybody's gettin' bands, we just dance to different drums (bram, bram, bram, bram, bram, bram)
i like who i've become
intermittent fasting, but these meals, i'm not missin' none (sorry)
