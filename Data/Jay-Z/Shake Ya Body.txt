we got honies everywhere
corks off the cris' poppin' everywhere
(woo!! woo!! woo!! woo!!)
partyin' hard like we just don't care (woo!! woo!!)
the best of both worlds, that shit ain't fair


this shit ain't fair
i, am, jay, hov'
mami shake ya body body, don't hurt nobody hottie
it's me in the god-body, r. kelly the john gotti
of r&b thug and me i would say i'm probably
the hardest rapper to ever cop on poppy and
put it in a song, ma how could you go wrong, huh? huh? huh?
worse than a armed robbery
know that i'm armed properly, whenever the arm's rocky
you can go on clockin' me, ain't nuttin' gon' stop me
high as allah i be, movin' in peace but i
move with the piece, so them, dudes in the streets
will never remove my piece, ha, ha, got me
niggas'll never get me, i never move sloppy
move with the glock-50, got some 2pac with me
let's not test my gangsta, just, raise your glasses
mami, shake ya asses, this is a thug classic
