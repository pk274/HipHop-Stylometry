it's young... uh, mack alone, i'm back in the zone
i'm out they way, still these rappers won't leave me alone
i can give a fuck what these rappers sayin' bout me
that just let's me know, they can't go a day without me
scared of me succeeding, that's the reason you doubt me
'cause if you ain't believe me, you wouldn't be thinkin' bout me
sorta how like you, never crossed my mind
until you crossed the line, stop...
then i gotta come across a rhyme
to let the world know you come across a mine
i do somersault with lines, when someone insults my grind
from marcy to party with the sultan of brunei
prude, am i, got a du-lema, i'm a dude from the hood
who loves jewels, who am i?
you where placed in the same shoes, size 10/5
with a sick view, of the place you grew, dude, can i
live, what i did, for this whole rap circus
i open up more doors for y'all fuckers than car service
ya'll nervous, i ain't back yet
i'm on extended vaca', i ain't unpack yet, stop worrying
