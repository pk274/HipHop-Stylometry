i got these niggas, breezy, don't worry about it
let that bitch breathe!

i used to give a fuck, now i give a fuck less
what do i think of success? it sucks, too much stress
i guess i blew up quick
'cause friends i grew up with
see me as a premie, but i'm not, and my nuts big
i don't know what the fuss is, my career is illustrious
my rep is impeccable; i'm not to be fucked with, with
shit, let that bitch breathe!
i'm way too important to be talking about extorting
asking me for a portion's like asking for a coffin
broad daylight i'll off your on-switch
you're not too bright, goodnight, long kiss
bye bye, my reply... "blah, blah"
blast burner, then pass burner to ty-ty
finish my breakfast, why?
i got an appetite for destruction and you're a small fry
now where was i?

i used to give a shit, now i don't give a shit more
truth be told i had more fun when i was piss-poor
i'm pissed off, and this what success is all about?
a bunch of niggas acting like bitches with big mouths
all this stress, all i got is this big house
couple of cars, i don't bring half of them shits out
all of this ace of spade i drink just to piss out
i mean, i like the taste, could've saved myself 6 hours
how many times can i go to mr. chow's, tao's, nobu?
hold up, let me move my bowels
i'll shit on y'all niggas, og, tell these boys
(y'all ain't got shit on my nigga, aoww!)
i got watches i ain't seen in months
apartment at the trump i only slept in once
niggas said hova was over, such dummies
even if i fell i'll land on a bunch of money
y'all ain't got nothing for me
