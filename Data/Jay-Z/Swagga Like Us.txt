(no one on the corner…) got a bop like this
can't wear skinny jeans, 'cause my knots don't fit
no one on the corner got a pocket like this
so i rock roc jeans, 'cause my knots so thick
you can learn how to dress just by checkin' my fresh
checkin' checkin' my fresh, checkin' checkin' my fresh
follow my steps is the road to success
where the niggas know you're thorough when the girls say yes
(yes…) but i can't teach you my swag
you can pay for school, but you can't buy class
school of hard knocks, i'm a grad
and that all-blue yankee is my graduation cap
it's hooooovaaaa
dippin' different rovers, whippin' with the soda
hooooovaaaa
did you even have any doubt? after doubt it was over
