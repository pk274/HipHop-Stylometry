if the emphasis on the compact disc is in the beat
then i'm gon' feature em and get rich
and let dre mix the shit, and drive off in the range ro'
'cause everywhere i go they love the "bling-bling" flow!
bang-bang, look at the way my chain glow
the ring on my fing' cost your man a lot of dough (oh)
the fuck am i bustin' my brain fo'?
it's just the way the game go and, oh, it takes two to tango
you call this a lame flow? you bought the shit
i guess you to blame too, i just found an angle (ha-ha-ha)
no more reality flow
i'm tryna time my album dropping with a reality show
cock the mac-11 in front of hot 97
and call my publicist, tell her we in press heaven (ha-ha)
no one gives a shit except
some kids that just got into sex on the internet
so you want the chatroom or the house in malibu?
em, your emphasis is on the wrong syl-la-la-ble
