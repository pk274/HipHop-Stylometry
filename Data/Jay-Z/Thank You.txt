thank you, thank you very much for coming out this evening


thank you, thank you, thank you, please hold your applause
for i just applied logic—keys, keys open doors
now i'm balcony, opera, black tux, binocular
black luxe, stop it, i shouldn't be so popular
name keep poppin' up, face keep poppin' up
on the tube, i'm just watchin' pacquaio box 'em up
how would i know hbo would get a shot of us?
sittin' so close that we almost got snot on us
please don't bow in my presence—how am i a legend?
i just got ten #1 albums, maybe now eleven?
more hits than a now 11; that is no reason
to treat me like i'm somehow from outta heaven
heaven knows that i've made my mistakes
thank god, what a guy, as i say my grace!
who woulda thought by makin' birds migrate for the winter
i be fly all summer? might i say


hovi baby, we are really high, really high tonight
we tip the waiter a hundred dollars to keep the ice cold, alright
we the last ones to keep the wise guys code alive
if i can't live by my word, then i'd much rather die
no no, don't thank me, this is just how my suit is stitched
i'm cut from a different cloth, i'm just who the shoe fits
for the color of money like a tom cruise flick
'cept i put eight balls in corners without usin' pool sticks
beautiful music when champagne flutes click, eh
beautiful women sippin' through rouge lips, eh
dangers approaches, we're like: "wait, who's this?"
let us save you some trouble, son, what size suit you is?
this way after the ruger shoots through a few clips
you can lay in your casket just as you is
we appreciate the target practices
we'll be sure to send flower baskets, kid


i was gonna kill a couple rappers, but they did it to themselves
i was gon' do it with the flow, but they did it with their sales
i was gon' 9/11 'em, but they didn't need the help
and they did a good job, them boys is talented as hell
'cause not only did they brick, they put a building up as well
then ran a plane into that building and when that building fell
ran to the crash site with no masks and inhaled
toxins deep inside their lungs until both of them was filled
blew a cloud out like a l into a jar, then took a smell
'cause they heard that second hand smoke kills
niggas thought they was ill, found out they was ill
and it's like you knew exactly how i wanted you to feel


we are really high, really really high, no
really really high, really high tonight, ha
we are really high, really high tonight
we are really high, really high tonight
lucky lefty,, kiss the wife goodnight for me, hehe
