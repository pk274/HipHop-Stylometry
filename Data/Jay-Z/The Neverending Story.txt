i'm a miracle born with imperial features
i'm a page turner, sage burner, santeria
chong√≥n, december baby, my orishas
saint hov, story takes place in ancient egypt
they'll cut off the nose to spite their face, they'll steal ya jesus
i can't tell hattie white that blue-eyed version is make believe stuff
she throw me out the house, say, "ye deliver us from this heathen"
i say that to ms. tina, she'll sneeze at sun, her photic reflex
they both had straightening combs, little did they know
i hold the heat next
neither tool can be used to fix our defects
p.s. we born perfect, fuck all the b.s
everybody wanna be us for real, we just gotta see us
insha'allah
