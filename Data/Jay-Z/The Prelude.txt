the game's fucked up
nigga's beats is bangin', nigga, your hooks did it
your lyrics didn't—your gangsta look did it
so i would write it if y'all could get it
bein' intricate'll get you wood, critic
on the internet, they like "you should spit it"
i'm like "you should buy it, nigga, that's good business" haha
forget this rap shit, i need a new hustle
a little bit of everything, the new, improved russell
i say that reluctantly, 'cause i do struggle
as you see, i can't leave, so i do love you
but i'm just a hustler disguised as a rapper
in fact, you can't fit this hustle inside of a wrapper
back when crack was what these pills are, i was a real star
complete with real cars, no video ones
you can come and set up a camera, let the video run
and my real life, complete with real ice
vvs boulders all invisibly set
head and shoulders, my invisible neck
you see, hova wasn't digital yet
before steve jobs made the ipod, was getting head jobs
we call that "interneck"
back when rappers wouldn't dare play lyrical roulette
with a automatic weapon i was rappin' with a tec
fresh like mannie be, chain like anti-freeze
shoebox full of cash, dealer-man hand me keys
pantries full of arm & hammer
don't take nancy drew to see what it do, i'm a damn g (ugh)
just sent a million dollars through a hands-free
that's big money talk—can you answer me?
before the answer was a three
i was down in georgetown with a hoya chick, lawyer chick
sure, he's rich now 'cause he saw the shit, all this shit
that's why they call him hov, 'cause he came before all this shit
bought a six, quarter seven, skipped on them quarter eights
bought a nine for nonstop glock work all the time (woo!)
guess who's back?
since this is a new era, got a fresh, new hat
ten-year veteran, i've been set
i've been through with this bullshit game, but i never can
i used to think rappin' at 38 was ill
but last year alone, i grossed 38 mil'
i know i ain't quite 38, but still
the flow so special, got a 38 feel
the real is back
hahahaha
