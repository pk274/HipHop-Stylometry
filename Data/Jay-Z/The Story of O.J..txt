you ever wonder why jewish people own all the property in america? this how they did it


financial freedom my only hope
fuck livin' rich and dyin' broke
i bought some artwork for one million
two years later, that shit worth two million
few years later, that shit worth eight million
i can't wait to give this shit to my children
y'all think it's bougie, i'm like, it's fine
but i'm tryin' to give you a million dollars worth of game for $9.99
i turned that 2 to a 4, 4 to an 8
i turned my life into a nice first week release date

there's a disconnect, we don't call that money over here, yeah
