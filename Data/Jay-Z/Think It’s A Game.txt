think it's a game 'til them things come out
i bang out 'til your brains hang out
'cause you're fuckin' with a gangster nigga, a gangster nigga (straight gangster nigga)
think it's a game 'til them things come out (uh, uh, uh)
i bang out 'til your brains hang out (straight gangster nigga)
'cause you're fuckin' with a gangster nigga, a gangster nigga (yeah)


they call me hov' the hustler, dough doubler
drove customers crazy in the late '80s, early '90s
now you can find me, girlie behind me, holdin' my mink up
ice pinkie ring in the air, drinkin' my drink up
top down, 'dro in the air, blowin' that stink up
it's seldom that i smoke, but it helps my thinker
makes me a mathematician about my math
get celebrity ass, i'm a statistician, rap with precision
nigga, your ho chose hov', that's rapid division
now divide yourself and slide
i, young vito, voice of the young people
mouthpiece for hustlers, ventriloquist for jugglers
took it where few went, made a few cents
don't call me hov' no more, call me the blueprint
sold dope (and), sold crack (and)
sold soap (and), sold rap (and)
bought bentley's, bought 'em back
nigga, can you buy that?
