yeah, fresh on the scene-a with a "fuck-the-next-nigga" demeanor
you know my work, i bless and press more skirts than the cleaners (uh)
i'm dead relaxed 'cause you cats can't stress the g
ain't a enough jump in 'em to make you high enough to test me
gwaan, niggas is moist like duncan hines
choice when i'm voicing my poise, i got poison lines
so flame on, i turn my game on to expert
niggas get chills when you hear my name on the network
fuck what you niggas kicking on the mic
you chicken like you don't know what an ass-whipping feels like
i'm giving flashbacks, i blaze, niggas split like asscracks
it's the j to the a, smoother than jazz tracks, uh
so when i'm browsing through your housing projects
niggas get five thousand, shit is rough
time to close, i hit you with sixteen of those
next time, maybe more, but who the fuck knows? (it's time to build)
