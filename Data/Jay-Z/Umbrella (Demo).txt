you already know what it is, right? woo!


rocka fella, fellas, umbrellas
eh, changin’ the weather
and g5 the better
my tunes is monsoons
it’s like a tsunami when i come out my mommy womb
hey, eh, eh, get your trench coats
when i flow over instrumentals, i drench hoes, hov
hey— rain man is back
with lil miss sunshine
rihanna, where you at?
