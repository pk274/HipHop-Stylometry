no clouds in my stones
let it rain, i hydroplane in the bank
comin' down with the dow jones (ayy, ayy, ayy)
when the clouds come, we go, we roc-a-fella (ayy-ayy-ayy, ayy)
we fly higher than weather, in g5's or better
you know me (you know me)
in anticipation for precipitation, stack chips for the rainy day
jay, rain man is back (ayy-ayy-ayy, ayy)
with little miss sunshine, rihanna, where you at?  (ayy-ayy-ayy, ayy)
