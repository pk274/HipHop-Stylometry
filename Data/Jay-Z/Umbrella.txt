uh-huh, uh-huh (yeah, teyana)
uh-huh, uh-huh (good girl gone bad)
uh-huh, uh-huh (take three, action)
uh-huh, uh-huh (hov)


no clouds in my stones
let it rain, i hydroplane in the bank
comin' down with the dow jones
when the clouds come, we go, we roc-a-fella
we fly higher than weather, in g5's or better
you know me (you know me)
in anticipation for precipitation, stack chips for the rainy day
jayâ€”rain man is back
with little miss sunshine, teyana, where you at?
