ugh, ahh
dre, i think i need my sponsor


i’m just outta contro-o-ol
maybe i got hoes, every little city i go, like potholes
we tryna grow, but i just can’t seen her
i’m havin’ trouble cleanin’ up, i’m like fema
all these little haters got me back with the nina
got me bringin’ guns to work, gilbert arenas
unh, i don’t know if it’s the goose talkin’
but you know they say the liquor get your truth talkin’
maybe i should be somewhere in the group talkin’
i’m addicted to coupes and takin’ roofs off ‘em
i’m addicted to watches, heckler and koches
them bow-legged girls from the projects
it’s bed-stuy in this bitch (bed-stuy!)
dre, what’s up? (it’s westside over here)
i’m in this party, i’m up to no good
and i should be duckin’ these clubs, tiger woods
