come, get some, ya little bum
i take the cake from under the baker's thumb
i bake the cake, get two of them from one
then i move the weight like i'm oprah's son
uh, i show you how to do this son
you need another helping hand to swing on
i stand alone but still you got a thing on
you're kobe, you're shaq, cagney and lacey
they still can't bake like me
and if i may make this one thing here
crystal clear, i push crystal, yeah
push fishscale, quicker than qadry ismail
re-up, three much, break digital scale
y'all should wish me well like the wishing well
'cause if this fail...
then it's back to pitchin' like david wells
to make this smell, jay get knocked
nigga, jay get bail
love pick me up in a grey s.l, the great excel
rap or raw, i'm walkin' a fine line
now who been gettin' dough since '89?
