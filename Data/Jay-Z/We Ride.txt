check, ghetto pro'
federal, jay-z shake the dice, let 'em go
bet a load i tear down every show
better know cheddar grow like the 'fro on ba'y bro
says r., jay y'all, all i need is four bars
i'm hotter than a lotta men
switch up cars like rodman's hair color, then hit your broad
i'm borderline too much for the mortal mind
every time you ought to rewind, find there's more to find
now pop that cork, then pour the wine
represent new york to chi-town, like what
floss mine, like of course my, what
never cross my family, can we all get along? hell no
i'm trying to tell y'all who dat is that rule that biz
not your baby daddy but jay-z, true that is
better school that kid on who's shoes that is
or who i be, nigga, v.i.p jigga, uh huh
