welcome to the jungle, welcome to the jungle, well
(yeah, uh, yeah)
i asked her where she wanna be when she twenty-five (five)
she turned around and looked at me and she said, "alive"
welcome to the jungle, welcome to the jungle, well
(uh, oh)


black axl rose, move halves and wholes (right)
come down to the jungle, just ask for hov (right)
move blocks and squares, move apples and pears (oh)
work pots and pans just to cop me some airs (goddammit)
my uncle died, my daddy did too (ayy)
paralyzed by the pain, i can barely move
my nephew gone, my heart is torn
sometimes i look to the sky, ask why i was born
my faith in god, every day is hard
every night is worse, that's why i pray so hard


why i pray so hard, this is crazy, god
just when i thought i had everything, i lost it all
so que ser√° (welcome to the jungle), get a case of syrah
let it chase the pain 'fore it goes too far (yeah)


my dreams is big, reality set in (huh)
let off a clip from a automatic weapon (yeah)
through shots in the door, it died in vegas
though it fought so hard, i knew it wouldn't make it
i'm a tortured soul, i live in disguise
rest in peace to the leader of the jackson 5 (ooh, woo)
i died in my sleep, i'm still big pimpin'
i ball at the mall, beginning of the ending (yeah)
where the fuck is the sun? it's been a while
mama, look at your son, what happened to my smile?
my tears is tatted, my rag in my pocket
i'm just looking for love, i know somebody got it
champagne for the pain, weed for the low
goddamn, i'm so high, where the fuck did i go?
i'm losing myself, i'm stuck in the moment
i look in the mirror, my only opponent
where the fuck is the press? where the fuck is the pres'?
either they know or don't care, i'm fucking depressed
no crying in public, just lying to judges
riskin' my life, i'm already dying, so fuck it, well
