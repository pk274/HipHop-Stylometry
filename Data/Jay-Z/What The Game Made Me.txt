i'm what the game made me
not what the fame made me
no amount of money can change me
i'm what you lames can't be
live nigga what? live as fuck


check, live from the 7-1-8
either respect the flow or learn your lesson from your wake
i'm wishin arthritis on all writers who, knock my hustle
how can y'all understand the struggle?
it's hard to live, when you got greedy niggas in the mix
knowin i outclass three-e niggas in the six
so i outblast til it's empty clips
and i outlast niggas, survival of the fit
one life, i gotta make sure it's done right
cause them yet to have a conversation bout reincarnation
ball out, until i fall out
stick thick chicks, try to tear they wall out
hard to think about your future with, nothin to gain
hard to concentrate on school with stomach pain
life's harsh, i know y'all runnin from 'caine
but it'll only catch you and track you down
with no deal, who you gonna rap to now?
start your own record company, that's profound
live niggas gonna rumble when you backs on the wall
jive niggas gonna crumble and fall


i'm what the game made me
not what the fame made me
no amount of money can change me
i'm what you lames can't be
live nigga what? live as fuck
