we still hustle 'til the sun come up
crack a forty when the sun go down
it's a cold winter, y'all niggas better bundle up
and i bet it be a hotter summer, grab a onion just to rock it down
you hot now, listen up
don't you know cops' sole purpose is to lock us down?
and throw away the key
but without this drug shit, your kids ain't got no way to eat, huh?
we still try to keep mom smilin'
cause when her teeth stop showin'
and her stomach start growlin' then the heat start flowin'
if you from the hood, i know you feel me (keep goin')
if a sneak start leaning and the heat stop workin'
then my heat start working, i'ma rob me a person
catch a nigga sleeping while he out in the open
and i'ma get him (keep flowin')
we gotta raise our kids while we livin'
make a million off a record, bail my niggas outta prison
fuck a bentley or a lexus, just my boys in the squadder
nigga talk reckless then i hit 'em with the smith 'n
but i'm never snitching, i'm a rider
if my kids hungry, snatch the dishes out ya kitchen
i'll be wilding 'til they pick me out a line-up
even though what we do is wrong
we keep the nines tucked, chopped dimes up, rap about it
wild out, fuck niggas up, laugh about it
i'm not tryna visit the morgue
but freeway move out 'til i sit with the lord
'til i, get my shit together, clean up my sins
freeway got it in like ten in the morning
and i can get it to ya like ten while you yawning, man
even though what we do is wrong
still deliver the order, man
and i ain't talking 'bout chicken and gravy, man
i'm talking bout bricks of yayo, halves and quarters
fou and a halves of hash, you do the math
swing past us, scoop up your daughter
she wanna roll with a thug that rap, you do the math
he gon' blast 'til my stacks in order, mang!


man, let me get 'em, free
hov never slacking mang, zipping in the black range
faster than the red ghost, getting ghost with pac-man
one-time know i got a knack to get that change
leader of the black gang, r-o-c, man
bang like t-mac, ski mask, air it out
gotta kill witnesses 'cause free's beard's sticking out
y'all don't want to witness shit, we squeeze hammers, mang
bullets breeze by you, like louisiana, man
but i gotta feed tianna, man
so i move keys, you can call me the piano man
rain, sleet, hail, snow man
slang dope, e, hydro man
