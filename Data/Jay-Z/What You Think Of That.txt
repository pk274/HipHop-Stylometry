what you think of that? what you think of that?
i'm a real ass nigga, what you think of that?
where my niggas at?

i love these streets, what you think of that?
my whole team rock rocks, we don't speak to cats (uh)
i'ma ball 'til i fall what you think of that?
what you think of that? what you think of that? (uh oh)

know niggas ain't frontin' like i'm a clown or sumthin'
like i don't get down or sumthin'
like i don't tote a 4 pound of sumthin'
round here frontin' like my shit don't sound like nuttin'
like i ain't got the crown or suttin'
like i ain't the nigga you base ya life on
i guess i ain't the reason you got that ice on
like i ain't the muthafuckin' dude with the shoes
i guess i ain't the reason you rhyme the way you do
like i ain't the nigga who mastered all flows
and the reason they can't sell them four point o's
like i ain't 5 mill', and what do ya joint go?
excuse me? nigga don't confuse me
i ain't one of you rappers who got a deal
i'm one of the few niggas spittin' it and got it for real
and even if you hatin', you gotta knock it in yo' wheels
and the day that i stop it.....ill!!
