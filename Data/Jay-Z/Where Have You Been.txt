i wanted to walk just like you (remember?)
wanted to talk just like you (word?)
often momma said i look too much
and i thought just like you (and i'd get happy)
wanted to drink miller nips and smoke newports just like you
but you left me, now i'm going to court just like you
i would say, "my daddy loves me and he'll never go away"
bullshit, do you even remember december's my birthday?
do you even remember the tender boy
you turned into a cold young man with one goal and one plan?
get mommy out of some jam, she was always in one
always short with the income, always late with the rent
you said you was coming through, i would stay in the hallway
always playing the bench (waiting) and that day came and went
fuck you very much, you showed me the worst kind of pain
but i'm stronger and trust me, i will never hurt again
would never ask mommy, "why daddy don't love me?
why is we so poor? why is life so ugly?
mommy, why is your eyes puffy?
please don't cry, everything'll be alright
i know it's dark now, but we gon' see the light
it's us against the world, we don't need him, right?" (right!)
mommy driving 6's now (yeah), i got riches now (yeah)
i bought a nice home for both of my sisters now
we doing real good, we don't miss you now
see how life twists around, fucker?
