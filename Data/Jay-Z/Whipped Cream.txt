sounds so soulful, don’t you agree?


uh, i invented swag
poppin' bottles, puttin' supermodels in the cab
proof
i guess i got my swagger back, truth
new watch alert: hublots
or the big face rollie, i got two of those
arm out the window through the city, i maneuver slow
cock back, snap back, see my cut through the holes


photo shoot fresh, looking like wealth
i'm 'bout to call the paparazzi on myself
uh, live from the mercer
run up on yeezy the wrong way, i might murk ya
flee in the g450, i might surface
political refugee, asylum can be purchased
uh, everything's for sale
i got five passports, i'm never going to jail


welcome to havana
smoking cubanos with castro in cabanas
viva méxico, cubano
dominicano, all the plugs that i know
driving benzes with no benefits
not bad, huh, for some immigrants?
build your fences, we diggin' tunnels
can’t you see we gettin' money up under you?


can’t you see the private jets flying over you?
maybach bumper sticker read: "what would hova do?"
jay is chillin' (uh), ye is chillin' (uh)
what more can i say?  we killin' 'em
hold up before we end this campaign
as you can see, we done bodied the damn lames
lord, please let them accept the things they can't change
and pray that all of their pain be champagne
