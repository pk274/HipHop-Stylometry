to the tune of the mayflower
and the mayflower sang
hearts of twelve they'd lead a prayer
and he sings of seven breezes
they all blowed past my door
in the morning sun and sky
and i'll be so lonely and i'll be thinking of you
i’ll be so lonely and i’ll be thinking of you
and the trees are greener on top than the trees in the moonglow
butter your apple blossom and the blue aglow
and there'll be nothing to prove
it’s getting late the sun has gone down
and the butterflies have flown away
and the forest has been cut down
and we've been fooled by the fairy tale lies
some days, some springs hold
but in the storms there's never a rose
no one to turn to
some people i've been
will miss you in so many ways
well i don’t want you around
no one to turn to, jay


i'm ready to tell the truth (are you ready?)
i've got everything, that i need
i have everything, this is the life i lead
a little too much, like i'm taking all the days
you're a man for the times (yes, sir, love)
you know who you should blame me (blame me)
why aren't you a man for the times
you can blame every man for the things they do
you should ask yourself why
you should ask every woman why (every)


i feel the same, yes i do
i don't know how to go (yeah)
i don't know how to go home
i don't know if i'm ready to leave
oh, can you feel it, i'm in the mood (yeah, mood)
yellow, the yellow, the yellow, the yellow
(the yellow, the yellow, oh-oh)
oh, can you feel it, i'm in the mood (mood, mood, mood)
yellow, the yellow, the yellow, the yellow
oh, can you feel it, i'm in the mood
i never thought that i could feel this way (jay)


i feel safe with you but you won't win me over anytime soon
i feel safe with you but you won't win me over anytime soon, oh-woah-woah (love)
