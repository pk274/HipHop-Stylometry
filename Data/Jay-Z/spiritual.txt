and it says, now the works of the flesh are manifest

and when they come, when they come to the surface
they come to the surface as demons

pray your father's father wasn't touching his little daughter
creating trans-generational trauma, that shit'll haunt ya
pray your little cousin ain't fall from the place that you fall asleep

in a hurricane of emotions
can't even raise my little daughter, my little carter

shattered in a million pieces, where the glass at
i need a drink, shrink or something
i need an angelic voice to sing something
bless my soul, extend your arms, i'm cold
hold me for a half hour until i am whole, yeah

just a boy from the hood that
got my hands in the air

this is the real me unfold
gangster is love, i'm thuggin', i'm huggin'

any crack that i blazed, that was nothin'
peeling back the layers, uncovering
scars that never healed, i never kept it this real
i acted out, my life a stage, ten thousand people watchin'
where's the little boy i knew?
i must have forgot him
stuntin', of course we never grew
but we're alone now and i'm singing this song for you
stuntin', of course we never grew
but we're alone now and i'm singing this song...you

got my hands in the air
in despair don't shoot
