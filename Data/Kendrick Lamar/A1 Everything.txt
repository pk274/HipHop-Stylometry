pray to god, i wash my hand but i be damned
2012, 100 racks to uncle sam
a 24 year old millionaire
don't read the contract 'less a mill in there
a1 credit, park my car bowlegged
i got a bus full of bitches, i call it jay-rome bettis
i grab my dick in the picture, your ho be cropping the image
i let you scrape off the dishes, we eating nigga, i'll finish
then come right back, hope you insomniac
sleep on me if you wanna take a dirt nap
bitch i'm talking ca-ca-ca-ca then more ca-ca-ca-ca
hit your roof until i pop your top up
then more ca-ca-ca-ca, til i know i gotcha
ballin like i'm baldin', then i see jordan in the mirror
nigga, that's flawless vvs, and cc text me, "what you wearing?"
puttin my all inside your bitch, i grip her hips, that's power steering
about to hydroplane when i board that plane
and land inside the building
