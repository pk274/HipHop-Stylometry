you wanna act tough
let's see if you really are, when this gun busts
oh you say you want war, nigga let's go
bring the drama, that's on my momma
you don't wanna rumble
jay rock i'll put you under
(you wanna act tough
let me see if you really hard, when this gun busts
oh you say you want war, nigga let's go
bring the drama, that's on my momma
you don't wanna rumble
k. dot will put you under)


since vaporubs mom's got my nyquizzle
i was just a scrub now it's all about the bizzles
trying to make a buck slinging weed and e pizzles
my nigga hit me up, and as far the stizzle
i'll eat your ass up show you how a bullet fizzle
get your ass touched one hand on your whizzle
the other on the clutch,  my middle finger up
shit i'm not giving a fuck
catch me on rosecrans and central leanin' like i'm supposed to
my brain is mental a nigga stay focused
plus i'm in the hood with the hood rats and roaches
caught crack, and served a three-fifth on my culture
desert eagle on me these niggas acting like vultures
i ain't dying homie i swear that your thoughts is bogus
keep the iron on me i'll crease you flat if you approach us
acting how you act you gone get some out of that holster


you wanna act tough
let's see if you really are, when this gun busts
oh you say you want war, nigga let's go
bring the drama, that's on my momma
you don't wanna rumble
jay rock i'll put you under
(you wanna act tough
let me see if you really hard, when this gun busts
oh you say you want war, nigga let's go
bring the drama, that's on my momma
you don't wanna rumble
k. dot will put you under)
