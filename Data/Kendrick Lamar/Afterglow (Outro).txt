when the lights get low and you notice i am the sun
the winter time was snow but only little you know
i will still breathe, give me the keys
i'm resuscitating the game, see me in cpr
my name is a gun cocked, gun shot
dead and i won't stop
gun cocked, gun shot
head in a pine box
with a dozen roses, hold this with a gift card
gun cocked, gun shot
flowers on your momma's yard
