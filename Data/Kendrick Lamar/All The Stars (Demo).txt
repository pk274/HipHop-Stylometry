yeah, i like it


love, let's talk about love
is it anything and everything you hoped for?
or do the feeling haunt you? (haunt)
i know the feeling haunt you (haunt)


this may be the night that my dreams might let me know
all the stars are closer
all the stars are closer
all the stars are closer
this may be the night that my dreams might let me know
all the stars are closer
all the stars are closer
all the stars are closer


tell me what you gon' do to me
confrontation ain't nothin' new to me
you can bring a bullet, bring a sword, bring a morgue
but you can't bring the truth to me
fuck you and all your expectations
i don't even want your congratulations
i recognize your false confidence
and calculated promises all in your conversation
i hate people that feel entitled
look at me crazy 'cause i ain't invite you
oh, you important?
you the moral to the story? you endorsin'?
mothafucka, i don't even like you
corrupt a man's heart with a gift
that's how you find out who you dealin' with
a small percentage who i'm buildin' with
i want the credit if i'm losin' or i'm winnin'
on my momma, that's the realest shit

this may be the night that my dreams might let me know
all the stars are closer
all the stars are closer
all the stars are closer
this may be the night that my dreams might let me know
all the stars are closer
all the stars are closer
all the stars are closer
