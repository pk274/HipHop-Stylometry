talk about it, make 'em talk about it
life to me is currency, prosperity, i got it
and your life to me is lifeless like it's livin' on life support
i license everything in my wallet
lightest boy with the biggest heart
nigga, play yo' part or parallel park yo' ego
next to me and violence
next to me is definitely no one, i'm one of one
and i musta won that from anybody who had it
or better yet forgot it
mack in the back of a 'lac with a mac
in the back of a 'lac with a latch on the back
of the trunk, hit a punk in the back with the pump
in the back 'til he's off balance
and i'm back in the front of the front of the future
when you are mentioning talent
and i'm back in the back of the block
with a cop, wanna cop anybody's allowance
iraq on the block, he watch with a block
or whatever and cut, no cut, mo' guns, mo' guts, fuck boy
you fucked up twice, you fucked considerin' you drownin'
die in a lake with a date with a catfish, backflip head first smilin'
cr-cry in the face of jesus, we just pray we keep on stylin'
on you bitches, tde, ymcm, big business, bitch!
