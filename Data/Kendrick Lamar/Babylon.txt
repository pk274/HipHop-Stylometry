cross my heart then i hope to die
with a peace of mind (a peace of mind)
piece together my brain
soon as this beat rewind (beat rewind)
nitrogen and propane
i spike your drink at times (turn up, turn up)
i make it hard to swallow this game
you throw up every line (every line)
i notice people got napoleon complexes
that's my confession (yeah, that)
you said that we're equal but i know you're beyond guessing
that i'm beyond desperate (yeah, that)
6am on a friday morning, my darkest hours
them heartless hours, my apartment is lost in a coffin
i'm dead to the world like i popped me a couple downers
down & out on my luck
salt water all on my tux and i call, she don't pick up
then i fall when summer is ending
i mean, there's no pretending
i'm stuck in my ways and you're offended, that's life
that's you, this me, that vice
you're wrong, i'm right, that's right
i belong somewhere on ice
i'm cold, and my new blood type?
even colder, cold shoulder
born sinner, you know? cole showed us!
i have nothing to lose
my dark side been well in-tuned
a gemini gon' show them faces
and this here just one of my moods, babylon
