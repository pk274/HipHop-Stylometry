i remember when it all started
on alondra, in that small apartment
burgundy carpet and sega cartridges
poppa flickin' blunt ashes all on his garments
momma off a wine cooler, magic johnson played jordan
i was only four but it's like i heard it before
house party crackin' off of the music doctor record
and according to my awareness i was more than coherent
a cold listener, mockin' that shit like a parrot
my cousins kickin' up dust, crippin', their flag, wear it
'round their hand like a mitten, aim and use it for leverage
shittin' on compton sheriffs like "fuck the police"
woofers and gold rollies, every swap meet should know me
cause i copped every record that dropped, dropped a dub
just to hear doc drop a jewel for the sake of hip-hop
whoever thought the moment i seen you on bullets for "cali love"
15 years later you'd be savin' my life, what?
