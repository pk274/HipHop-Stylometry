and we'll be screamin' out no rules, no rules
feel the energy we go through, i told you
pump my fist like i'm supposed to, i showed you
my vision of the unsocial, it's so cool
look around me and you'll see the scene, who to blame?
see my generation has no shame, i play the game
how i see it this is inside the future, this is nothin' that you're used to
i refuse to play the victim, my religion is to move ya
out your power position, my army head-on collision
can't harm me out of my own skin, government need assistance
every time that i zone in, nothing is more convincin'
than tellin' you that i won't bend, break or fake partition
i can't, this is my life design, this is me taking mine's
this is what i live for, this is me takin' yours
this is more than c4, this is what happens when
we ready to build and destroy, i hope that you enjoy

i live my life a rebel, a vigilante, devils try to get at me
pedal through this underworld, undertakers won't catch me
system ain't no system for justice if you would ask me
i'll tell you everything is corrupted, don't you walk past me
with the condescended look i can tell you're pretendin'
like you my friends and you just a henchman, i feel relentless
i feel the tension in the air thick enough to cut through it
or cut you with it, i'm cut from a cloth that bred a nuisance
trespass on your property i am properly aimin' to go against ya democracy
this is me changing faces 'cause i can stand alone and die alone as long as i got pride
the victory of fight is all in my eyes
the night is young and i can see your demise, i'm waitin' for it
you canâ€™t ignore it, you live dormant, i die enormous
big as the lies you tell i can tell that you feel defeated
the truth will set you free and to me that's the only reason, capisce?
