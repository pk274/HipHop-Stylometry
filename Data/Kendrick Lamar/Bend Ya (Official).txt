uh, soon as i enter
i put a hurting on it, if i don't kill it she injured
for a long time, summer, spring and winter
fall for anythin', you clumsy ass nigga
jumpin' off the boat in some 87' locs
she's seen them hundred spokes and then that woman spoke
but i don't talk back, i put my life on tracks
if that don't work, put your wife on track
show me where the candle wax, it must be you
because i burn right through, everythin' ya'll do
high octane when i bring on my last name
uh, mr. lamar aka â€œthe cash king"
uh, quicker than pre-cum, won't you give her a reason
to not meet up with me like a vegan?
psst, goddamn, i'm the fuckin' man
she said fuck her man, now she fuck with mann
