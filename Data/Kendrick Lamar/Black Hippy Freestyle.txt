i said we don't wanna hear that weak shit no more
my flow china white
like a sheep in the snow
i go deep as the bible, i could debate with the pope
and you rappers go down hill
like a ski on the slope
i been a boat with papi
but i ain't trying to cop no work
i'm trying to cop me the boat and some more property
i told rock
"we gotta be more then just a commodity
make the whole name and entity to infinity"
y'all want me off the juice, no grenadine
could stop me from thinking presidential like the scattered brains of kennedy
after i shot, duck down
so the crowd won't witness me
now, could somebody locate mr. shakur?
and tell these tupacs, they two shots, away from two blocks
of being neighbors with the almighty lord
i put your best material in, then fast forward
kendrick, signing off
i'm sure your signature's forged, boy
