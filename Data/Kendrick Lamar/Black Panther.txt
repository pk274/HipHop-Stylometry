(why i go easy?)
(know why i go easy)
wait


king of my city, king of my country, king of my homeland
king of the filthy, king of the fallen, we livin' again
king of the shooters, looters, boosters, and ghettos poppin'
king of the past, present, future, my ancestors watchin'
king of the culture, king of the soldiers, king of the bloodshed
king of the wisdom, king of the ocean, king of the respect
king of the optimistics and dreamers that go and get it
king of the winner's district and geniuses with conviction


king of the fighters, king of the fathers, king of the belated
king of the answer, king of the problem, king of the forsaken
king of the empathy, your resentment, king of remorse
king of my enemies, may they fall defeat, i rejoice
king of the skyscrapers, dodgin' haters, broke religion
nine faces, go against 'em, i erased 'em with precision
i embrace them with collision, kings did it
king's vision, black panther, king kendrick, all hail the king!


i dropped a million tears
i know several responsibilities put me here
i don't pedal backwards, but i live old-fashioned
the lens that i'm lookin' through
won't prescribe me the right glasses, masses are now free
ashes i'm dumpin' out, 'bout to spread all 'cross seas
sisters and brothers in unison, not because of me
because we don't glue with the opposition, we glue with peace
but still'd fuck up your organization if any beef


what do you stand for?
are you a activist? what are your city plans for?
are you a accident? are you just in the way?
your native tongue contradictin' what your body language say
are you a king or you jokin'? are you a king or you posin'?
are you a king or you smokin' bowl rocks to keep you open?
because the king don't cry, king don't die
king don't lie, king give all, king get by, king don't fall
kingdom come, when i come, you know why
king! king! king! king! king!
i am t'challa
