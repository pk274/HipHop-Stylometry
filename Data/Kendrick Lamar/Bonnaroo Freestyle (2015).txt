bonaroo, how y'all feelin'?
this side- this side the loudest, you know what i'm sayin'
i'm gon' kick something like this 
i said right now it's me and my homie chance the rapper
freestylin' and nobody count after
nobody compete, y'all weak
this is more than us, an athlete
this is rhymes on stage, this is a rage
this not a party, this is a parade
i pass it to my homeboy chance
give it to 'em with ya homeboy man


one, two-
i said this side got's to be lava
this side right here got to be fire
this side right here cannot defy ya
that side might have to retire
rhymes don't stop, straight off the top
r&b with 2005 hip-hop

and that's the music flow
and if you with me right now, homie now ya know
i said we talkin' bout surf, talkin' 'bout k dot
knowin' we rule the earth, talkin' about hip-hop
talkin' this non-stop, talkin' that real rock
talkin' right from chicago, l.a. the top
make some mothafuckin' noise in this bitch
cause you know i don't stop, this is great as it get! (noise)


ayy, ayy

one, two, three, make some noise
uh, uh, uh, uh

uh, uh, uh, uh
