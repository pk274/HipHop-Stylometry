from l.a. to n.y
'nough cackalacky t-shirts and khakis in dubai
application from mile high, dreams money can buy
overnight if it's possible, dodged the universe's obstacle
stray bullets and hospitals
i done seen niggas get rich
seen niggas that broke the cliche that life is a bitch
still exist inside the ghetto
tupac at least never lied when he said he's against the odds
most niggas would wish you well, but soon as that well is dry
stuck in it by yourself hoping that you can camouflage
with killers again, defending your chin when you walk outside

far as myself, i never hit niggas below the belt
helped you when you couldn't help yourself
you crossed me then you got dealt
it's simple mathematics, imagine your life in a mansion
believe it and it can happen, nigga
this' law of attraction nigga



but some niggas don't learn 'til the iron is hot
and when it decide to stop
you just gotta let it (burn)
burn, burn, burn, burn, burn, burn, burn
'cause some niggas don't learn 'til the iron is hot
and when it decide to stop
you just gotta let it (burn)
burn, burn, burn, burn, burn, burn, burn
and all the hoes say, that's some good game
and all the bros say, that's some good game


from l.a. to n.y
'nough cackalacky t-shirts and khakis in dubai
cameras asking me "do i
still smoke like i used to, still kick up the woo-raa"
bank account by the buku, meals inside of my ride
seen niggas get rich
seen niggas that broker than what they had started with
what's the point of a starter kit
if residuals doesn't flip, like hoes do
you dip a dorito chip or you eatin' off soul food?
back when i was local, pushing 20s fast forward
dre recording my vocals
i was 20 years old, gang banging and pro tools
stuck in the streets, the studio was relief
and sellin' records was a homecomin' for me
dog pound, rehabilitation for street niggas
nice cars but still court cases for each nigga
judas sittin' at the table watchin' 'em eat with us
judas caught a bullet quick, keep the receit nigga
had to keep the fakers far from around me
cut a couple homies off 'cause they tried to down me
and look where they found me
in jamaica rolling up khalifa papers
and damian is my neighbor, i'm aiming shots at the haters
i give you the crown don't give it back
don't fuck it up i just want you to rap, nigga
the coast on your back, nigga what



but some niggas don't learn 'til the iron is hot
and when it decide to stop
you just gotta let it (burn)
burn, burn, burn, burn, burn, burn, burn
'cause some niggas don't learn 'til the iron is hot
and when it decide to stop
you just gotta let it (burn)
burn, burn, burn, burn, burn, burn, burn
and all the hoes say, that's some good game
and all the bros say, that's some good game
