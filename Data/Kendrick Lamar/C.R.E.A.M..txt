snotty-nosed kid with dreams of getting c.r.e.a.m
like cake batter
by any means, son
we make your face splatter
word life
i never understood the broke type
thinkin' back then when i hustled my first stolen bike
i used to gamble with silver dollars
now i gamble with benjamin franklins, dom pérignon, and lobster
money-making for real, kid
i'm tryin' stay fresh like will did
back in the '90s
killer bees behind me
swarming anything that enter the perimeter
of this money-making machine
when winter come
it goes down
we balls out
and you?
you just out of bounds
without a doubt
we move in unison
you move like a honda with the brakes gone out
out of control
you just might
powder your nose
if you step on the mic after me
drug residue
every time i leave the booth
you fall far behind
a time machine can't save you
me?
i'm ahead of the pack
like a high-speed pursuit
we kick flows
then rekick 'em like kung fu
i'm bruce lee
whether nikes or timb boots
beefcake the poppy, see
we ain't scared to shoot
carry three pieces on me
like a steve harvey suit
i'm on my method man shit
the 3 west coast wu tang members now exist
