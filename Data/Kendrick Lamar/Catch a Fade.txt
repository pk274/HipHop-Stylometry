jumping off the front porch with a new approach
don't approach me with the bullshit
i remote to a location where the broom sit
here i go street sweeper monday through friday
if not go we can catch a fade, catch a fade, catch a fade
catch a fade, catch a fade, catch a fade, catch a fade


pulling up and hopping out
shell, catch it poppin' out
and i ain't never been a tom or a jerry
pussy or a rat, pussy on my nutsack
carry plenty kenny tats, give me that, give me plenty fetti
federales on my back, pack them in the cemetery
send a scary hit out on your messenger
i'm ignorant to wrestle a gorilla in the center of an acura integra
i'm pissed off, so i piss off rooftops
drinking through a straw, fuck a rent-a-cop
i'm hot, i'm napalm when the beat slap like eight palms
and i wear eight charms, every airport alarm
go off till they tackle me, what i do wrong?
nigga it ain't 'bout the chain, nigga you the fucking bomb
bomb on a bitch nigga then his bitch later
put the tips on the bitch, nigga you a fucking waiter
i don't even want a favor, i just want a fair one
and it's like that till the sheriffs come


jumping off the front porch with a new approach
don't approach me with the bullshit
i remote to a location where the broom sit
here i go street sweeper monday through friday
if not go we can catch a fade, catch a fade, catch a fade
catch a fade, catch a fade, catch a fade, catch a fade


jumping off the front porch with a new approach
don't approach me with the bullshit
i remote to a location where the broom sit
here i go street sweeper monday through friday
if not go we can catch a fade, catch a fade, catch a fade
catch a fade, catch a fade, catch a fade, catch a fade


jumping off the front porch with a new approach
don't approach me with the bullshit

here i go street sweeper monday through friday
if not go we can catch a fade, catch a fade, catch a fade
catch a fade, catch a fade, catch a fade, catch a fade
