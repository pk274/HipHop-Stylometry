the feeling that i'm feeling is too real
i know you feel it too, because your feelings, they concealed
you shot me through the roof and held me right under my will
thinking if i made the blueprint, they maybe we can - build
somebody tell my mama i just died
the irony is i ain't never felt more alive
i see a piеce of heaven whеn i look inside your eyes
tryna level with your broadcast, angel in disguise
lets find a better place that we can go
far away from everything and everything we know
'cause ignorance is bliss and this society's a trip
i don't wanna see a slip, watch another paradise unfold
my plan is that we take it to the top
the only time we coming down is when our hearts drop


i remember running from bullets and stray shots
but i might stand there when yo' gun go, pop


so now we on that everlasting high
we chose to leave from planet earth and live inside the sky
i know your last relation hurtin' heavy, did you cry?
i said to look ahead and won't you put your tears, a-side
it's funny how these things'll play out
i used to think a player with some game would play out
i used to hit the city late night and stay out
sippin' something with my lady friends, at the steak house
but now i think i found just what i need
what i didn't have, i think i'm up to speed
the race against your love, and i don't plan on giving up
even if you overlap me, i won't watch you take the lead
i promise i'mma give it all i got
'cause what you got to give, money couldn't buy


i remember running from bullets and stray shots
but i might stand there when yo' gun go "pop"
