hold up, biatch! this yo' favorite song
translation: ven aquí, mami, ese culo
tú quieres coger mis huevos, y papi me desespero
chuparse puto pendejo, el pinche cabrón
let's get it – nights like this, i'm a knight like this
sword in my hand, i fight like this
and i'm more than a man, i'm a god
bitch, touché, en garde
toupée drop and her two tits pop
out of that tank top and bra
and when i say "doo-doo-doo-doo," bitch, that be k. dot
she want some more of this
i give her more of this, i owe her this
in fact, i know she miss the way i floored this, on forgis
i know my houston partners, drop a four on this
and focus, and slow it down
alright, let me blow this bitch
i'm famous, i blame this on you, cash in the mirror
hang in my penthouse roof, skyline the clearest
watch it, your optics poppin' out, you look the weirdest
pop my top on the 105, head with no power steerin', ah!
