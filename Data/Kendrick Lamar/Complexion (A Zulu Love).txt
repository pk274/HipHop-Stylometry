uh, dark as the midnight hour or bright as the mornin' sun
give a fuck about your complexion, i know what the germans done
sneak (dissin')
sneak me through the back window, i’m a good field nigga
i made a flower for you outta cotton just to chill with you
you know i'd go the distance, you know i'm ten toes down
even if master listenin', cover your ears, he 'bout to mention

uh, dark as the midnight hour, or bright as the mornin' sun
brown skinned, but your blue eyes tell me your mama can't run
sneak (dissin')
sneak me through the back window, i’m a good field nigga
i made a flower for you outta cotton just to chill with you
you know i'd go the distance, you know i'm ten toes down
even if master's listenin', i got the world's attention
so i'ma say somethin' that's vital and critical for survival
of mankind, a feline color should never rival
beauty is what you make it, i used to be so mistaken
by different shades of faces
then whit' told me, "a woman is woman, love the creation"
it all came from god, then you was my confirmation
i came to where you reside
and looked around to see more sights for sore eyes
let the willie lynch theory reverse a million times with...

you like it, i love it
you like it, i love it
you like it, i love it
you like it, i love it
you like it, i love it
you like it, i love it
you like it, i love it
you like it, i love it
(where the homegirl rapsody at?
i need you to speak your mind real quick, loved one!)


barefoot babies with no care
teenage gun toters that don't play fair, should i get out the car?
i don't see compton, i see something much worse
the land of the landmines, the hell that's on earth
