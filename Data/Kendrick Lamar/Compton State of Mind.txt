yeah, kendrick lamar
this for the town, nigga


me, i'm from the hub city, yeah, that compton court building
caught a murder when his homie died, judge caught feelings
i'm on rosecrans, chilling right inside best outlest
five dollar little caesar, momma shopped at food-4-less
elementary mcnair, say what's up to vanguard
centennial high, had me swimming with a pool of sharks
me, i'm just a good kid, tryna keep it neutral
but i'm well aware that a square can get shot too
most crip and some piru, that's just how the game go
hood on every corner, stop for gas and get your brains blown
bitches with fat asses, burners in the stashes
murders in july, call that summer time madness
rest in peace 4 bent, rest in peace mausberg
swear to god, when i make it big, your voice'll be heard
me, i'm just a good kid, tryna keep it positive
though i know it's chaos, forever my heart will live in
