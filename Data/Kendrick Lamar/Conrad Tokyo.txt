toleration for devastation, got a hunger for sin
every nation obama nation, let the coroner in
crooked faces, red and blue laces for the color of men
just embrace it and die alone, song of revelation
reverends and cattles racing
devils and demons and deuteronomy
fumigate our economy, 'lluminate broken dreams
and manifest all insanity, look around
sayonara tomorrow, it's just blood on the ground


conrad tokyo, sapporo, pistachio
