one of these lives, i'ma make things right
with the wrongs i've done, that's when i unite
with the father, son, 'til then, i fight
rain on me, put the blame on me
got guilt, got hurt, got shame on me
got six magazines that's aimed at me
done every magazine, what's fame to me? fuck, man!
(and i'm tripping and falling)
it's a game to me, where the bedroom at?
sleep, i ain't never had affairs with that
what's fair when the hearts and the words don't reach?
what's fair when the money don't take things back?
it's rare when somebody take your dreams back
(and i'm tripping and falling)
i care too much, wanna share too much, in my head too much
i shut down too, i ain't there too much
i'm a complex soul, they layered me up
then broke me down, and morality's dust, i lack in trust
(and i'm tripping and falling)
this time around, i trust myself
please everybody else but myself
all else fails, i was myself
outdone fear, outdone myself
this year, you better one yourself
(and i'm tripping and falling)
masks on the babies, mask on an opp
wear masks in the neighborhood stores you shop
but a mask won't hide who you are inside
look around, the reality's carved in lies
wipe my ego, dodge my pride
(and i'm tripping and falling)
look myself in the mirror
amityville, ain't seen nothin' scarier
i fought like a pitbull terrier
blood i shed could fill up aquariums
tell all my angels, "carry 'em"
(and i'm tripping and falling)
every emotion been deprived
even my strong points couldn't survive
if i didn't learn to love myself, forgive myself a hundred times, dawg


i love when you count me out
i love when you count me out
i love when you count me
i love when you count me out
i love when you count me out
i love when you count me
(and i'm tripping and falling)
(and i'm tripping and falling)
(and i'm tripping and falling)
(and i'm-)
