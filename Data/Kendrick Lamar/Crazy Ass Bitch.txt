fuck that, you fucked up, a fatal attraction, good luck
the way that i'm reacting to your love
cupid shot twice, you can't duck
stupid is what stupid does huh
you probably thinkin' i'm tweaking off on a drug huh
you probably thinkin' i'm creeping up on your work place
tweeterin' when you in the club huh?
straight like that though
rain on your parade in seattle
and your mom complain that i'm an asshole
i'm tryna' put it in your unh (x3)
my little tadpoles
swim, swim, good, left, stroke, right, stroke
i wish we could elope and remote to rio
rewrote my vows, i shall devote
everything i lose and then gain
all i need is your attention
all i need is your now i would go to war
if them papers said to restrain
hold up
lookin' in your window trying to see what i could find
i don't really ask for much all i want is your time
everything i lose and then gain
all i need is your attention
all i need is your, now i would go to war
if them paper said to restrain
strain (4x)
hold up
