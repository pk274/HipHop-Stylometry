your false prophets will never jump in my pockets
you're poppin' your gums and i'm poppin' your optics
optimus prime when i'm done
and the topic of music is me
and the logic is usually
you should stop in and grab a degree
in the science of how to emcee
and i'm watchin' the critics critique
when i'm climbing the valleys and peaks
and aligning myself
while i'm riding orion's belt
in the street and defiling this beat
as a dead bitch that lay at my feet
this is king shit...
