yeah, kendrick lamar, tone what up,check it out
as the day go i let the beat rock
then put my thoughts inside the cradle, hip hops
god father plant the seed, you should be my son
and if you niggas hot, i guess i am the sun
i'm a degree away from global warming, this a warning
shot like i knew big but i'm enormous
i hear an instrumental then i turn to norman
so go tell ‘em i killed it you fucking informant
i’m always performing
like it’s my last morning
before i sit with the lord and see my mother mourning
i’m in the air with it like a new pair of jordans
ground level never been important when i walk the earth
walk to church bishop said he lost his bible this time
told me that he need a verse, i blessed him with a couple of lines
bear hugged a few bears, wrestle with a couple of lions
that’s the imagery i delivery when i fuck a rhyme…
fuck off, kendrick lamar
