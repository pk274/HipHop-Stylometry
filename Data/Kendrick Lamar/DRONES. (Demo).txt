y'all know what happens on earth stays on earth
this shit called "drones"
here we go


smoke and watch a movie
jokin' with the young and goofy
scrollin' through his phone and seen the cuban link that's worn by gucci
fascinated by gangster shit and tryna get rich
or fakin' like he got it so everyone double-tap his pic'
deposited fake reality for salary, non-negotiable
overdosin' on sociable quotables so the locals know
that his chain is a movie
that his bitches is bougie
that his actavis leanin'
that he really unruly
twenty-seven with pocket money and four rugrats
ain't punchin' clocks, but punctuation on "wherе the plug at?"
dry-snitchin' and fishin' for likes, but frequеnt visits
postin' pictures with burners for stripes and recognition
flexin' with four bands, he smile for the cameraman
then instagrammed his location, his followers tappin' in
three enemies waitin', one bullet, one mask
got his fuckin' brains blown out over two hashtags, you know
