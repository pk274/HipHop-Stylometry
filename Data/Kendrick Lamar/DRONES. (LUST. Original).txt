i need some water
something came over me
way too hot to simmer down, might as well overheat
too close to comfort
as blood rush my favorite vein
heartbeat racing like a junkie's
i just need you to want me
am i asking too much?
let me put the head in
ooh, i don't want more than that; girl, i respect the cat
i promise, just a touch
let me put the head in
if it's okay; she said, "it's okay"


yeah, i need everybody's motherfuckin' hands up right now
i need everybody's motherfuckin'—
door and his nike air rattles
rush the firе exit, no time for battles
wеll i, i never expected
this that new shit
this that new, new shit


wake up in the mornin', thinkin' 'bout money, kick your feet up
watch you a comedy, take a shit, then roll some weed up
go hit you a lick, go fuck on a bitch
don't go to work today, cop you a fit
or maybe some kicks and make you—


wake up in the morning, thinking 'bout money, kick your feet up
watch you a comedy—hol' up
wake up in the mornin', thinkin' 'bout money, kick your feet up
watch you a comedy, take a shit, then roll some weed up
go hit you a lick, go fuck on a bitch, don't go to work today
cop you a fit or maybe some kicks and make it work today
hang with the homies, stunt on your baby mama
sip some lean, go get a pistol, shoot out the window
bet your favorite team, play you some madden
go to the club or your mama house
whatever you doing, just make it count (i need some water)
wake up in the morning, thinking 'bout money, kick your feet up
hop in the shower, put on your makeup, lace your weave up
touch on yourself, call up your nigga, tell him he ain't shit
credit card scam, get you a visa, make it pay your rent
hop on the 'gram, flex on the bitches that be hatin' on you
pop you a pill, call up your bitches, have 'em waitin' on you
go to the club, have you some fun, make that ass bounce
it's whatever, just make it count

i wake in the morning, my head spinning from the last night
both in a trance, feelings are dead—what a fast life
manager called, the lobby call is 11:30
did this before, promised myself i'd be a hour early
room full of clothes, bag full of money: call it loose change
fumbled my jewelry, 100k, i lost a new chain
hop on the bird, hit the next city for another m
take me a nap then do it again
we all woke up, tryna tune to the daily news
looking for confirmation, hoping election wasn't true
all of us worried, all of us buried, in our feelings deep
none of us married to his proposal, make us feel cheap
stale and sad, distraught and mad, tell the neighbor 'bout it—
bet they agree, parade the streets with your voice proudly
time passing, things change
reverting back to our daily programs, stuck in our ways
drones
