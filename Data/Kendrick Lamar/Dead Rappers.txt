goodbye, i know the rapper dead
i'm on my murder job again in the morning
this 187 on the line i know the rapper dead
that means another record label is mourning
so you can run but you cannot hide
cause when i see 'em i'mma kill 'em
when i see 'em i'mma kill 'em
mortician got a feeling with embalming fluid
cause when i see 'em i'mma kill 'em
when i see 'em i'mma kill 'em
lyrical homicide best believe i do


yo q, these niggas think they cute
talking louder than the trumpet, when i see 'em where the fluke?
your opinion something moving like pew pass by 'em, hog tie 'em for the revenue, bullets peer through the bulletproof
look what the iron do scope now i'm eyeing you
silencer, now my iron grew i en route
learn, of the flow first to realize these rap guys
shit on 'em then throw them to the flies bombs like al-ca-ter
ride on my enemies, homicide
text like a referee, give you free shot for any penalty
drop metaphors, nouns and verbs plenty similes
serve like a waitress and you don't want seconds courtesy
off k dot, the son of 2pac
biggies nephew big l said i was special
now let's do, lunch over these beats
even punch said i was sweet
punchlines and kick hot rhymes 'till i'm burning my feet
ouch

she rather throw herself in the dumpster than listen to trash
