yeah i can reconcile being depressed real bad
i’m a thinker not a drinker but still i hennessy drag
alcohol numbs the pain like with novacane stabs
in your arteries pardon me but my city go mad
via compton california, corners with coroners and karma on em
colors corresponding to gangs upon us
common corrupted crip & piru’s cripple the city
triple the crime, bible nor the qur’an can save
welcome don’t be afraid, your city similar right?
where the choppers kidnap the night and police silence your rights
stare at the sky wonder will you live to see 25?
i’m 22 at 20 i knew i was against the odds
this kid named jonathan was monitorin’
his momma & sister, his older cousin he honoured him
anonymous bodies on his burner was astonishin’
to johnny he might have been a modern day rider then
he walking outside again, he see the lifestyle of an active member
pull out a mac 11, now his eyes is big
fascinated by mayhem, what’s his cousin to say now?
he wanna be from the hood that he’s from and thats one
more gangster under the family tree, took em under his wings like kfc
crip crazy, rocking matching t-shirts that says “the hood made me”
no love just spread slugs thats the policy, the leader and the prodigy
now shorty do-wap, holdin a ou-wap, hanging with rah rah’s with blah blah’s
that sit on the block catching fades, hitting licks, going on missions with lunatics
a 9th grade menace thugging for 6 months, smoking like 6 blunts
an hour the power of banging, he was walking… *3 gun shots*
little johnny
