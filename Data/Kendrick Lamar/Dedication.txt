i spent my whole life thinkin' out the box
boxin' homies three-on-one, got dp'ed but i ain't drop
chirp on me, here i come, brrt, spin around the block
they blurped on me, said i ran a stop sign but that's a lie
i spent my whole life starin' at the stage
playin' sega, daddy smokin' sherm, mama playin' spades
catchin' vapors, grandma said i'd get some jordans for my grades
that's my baby, when she died my heart broke a hundred ways
i spent my whole life tryna make it, tryna chase it
the cycle of a black man divided, tryna break it
you take a loss? shit, don't cry about it, just embrace it
minor setback for major comeback, that's my favorite
my nigga l said, "you do a song with nip, k. dot, he a better crip"
i said, "he a man first, you hear the words out his lips
about flourishing from the streets to black businesses?"
level four, yard livin', given to false imprisonment
listen close, my nigga
it's bigger than deuces and fours, my nigga
since elementary we close, my nigga, yeah, straight like that
i give you the game, go back to the turf and give it right back
for generations we been dealt bad hands with bad plans
prove your dedication by hoppin' out grand am's
i'm at the premiere politickin' with top, nip, and snoop
damn, pac watchin' the way we grew, from dedication


if it ain't congratulate then it look like hate
if it ain't congratulate then it look like what, nipsey?
hol' up
