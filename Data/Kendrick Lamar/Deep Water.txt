motherfucker know i started from the bottom, vodka baby bottle
mixin' that with similac, my momma knew i had a problem
wasn't thinking 'bout no rapping, i was juuging for a dollar
putting quarter pieces in the black caprice and make it holla
no policing me, i got the beast in me, i gotta holla
keep the decency and make them tnt my product
i'm a c-o-m-p-t-o-innovator, energizer
inner city bullet flyin' 'til that bitch on auto pilot
ah, shit! i don't give a fuck about your whereabouts
all i care about is wearing out your area
and airing out your upper body
when i catch ya walking out your parents' house
(don't get it fucked up!) homie got fucked up
tryna park his tour bus, not knowing what's what
or who's who, living in the l.a. county zoo
pick them off like a big dog, motherfucker, woof!
once upon a time, i shot a nigga on accident (boom, boom, boom)
i tried to kill him but i guess i needed more practicing (boom, boom, boom)
that's when i realized banging wasn't for everybody
switch it up before my enemy or the sheriff got me
they liable to bury him, they nominated six to carry him
they worry him to death, but he no vegetarian
the beef is on his breath, inheriting the drama better than
a great white, nigga, this is life in my aquarium
