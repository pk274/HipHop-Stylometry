i pop the pain away, i slide the pain away
i pop the pain away, i slide the pain away
i picked you up when you
fell and cut your knee
told you not to cry and held you
close to me


do you love me? do you trust me?
can i trust you? don't judge me
i'ma die hard, it gets ugly
too passionate, it gets ugly
mmm, ah-ah
i wonder where i lost my way?
mmm, ah-ah
been waiting on your call all day
tell me you in my corner right now
when i fall short, i'm leanin' on you to cry out
we all got enough to lie about
my truth too complicated to hide now
can i open up? is it safe or not?
i'm afraid a little, you relate or not?
have faith a little, i might take my time
ain't no savin' face this time


i got some regrets
i-i-i-i-i-i-i
but my past won't keep me from my best
i-i-i-i-i-i-i
subtle mistakes felt like life or death
i-i-i-i-i-i-i
i wanna see the family stronger
i wanna see the money longer
you know that i'd die for you
i get emotional about life
the lost ones keepin' me up at night
the world be reminding me it's danger
i'll still risk it all for a stranger
if i told you who i am, would you use it against me?
right or wrong, no stone, just love to send me
