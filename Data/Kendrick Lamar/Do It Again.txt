everyday i try to escape the realities of this world
so i tell a disc jockey “press play” while i press up on a girl
in the midst of the smoke in the air
the reflection of lights that glare
she'll be out of control like a hydroplane in plain sight i might have to stare
and that's power steering, a power trip will see my appearance
pile of hundreds all on a prowl like vampires in the darkest dungeon
speakers bumpin', drinks is pouring
we in the house, we paid the mortgage, tyrannosaurus
that's real big, pop my collar, pop that lid


come to my section (my section)
and down some of this liquor
then tell me what it hit for
gon' be some things i don’t remember
so take some camera phone pictures
