no more "please, stop"
no more hashtag boo'd up screenshots
no more tryin' to make me jealous on your birthday
you know just how i made you better on your birthday, oh
do he do you like this? do he woo you like this?
do he lay it down for you, touch your poona like this?
matter fact, never mind, we'll let the past be
may be his right now, but your body's still me, woah
