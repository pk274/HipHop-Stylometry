chillin in my teepee, no indian but he be
the realest shit i must admit i'm baskin in my feces
my style is harder, yours is watered down they call it fiji
the bible or my cd, both of them were said to be the
formula to live your life, or coping with the ills
no time to play kid, i think you needs to chill
house party with killers, pray for italy villas
where accents think it's buffy and chandeliers hang from ceilings
i'm dreaming, i'm scheming to be major
compose art like a mozart, the sequel to amadeus, today is
the day i see the sun, ignoring all the rain
the fat lady has sung, octaves as high as planes
paper bout the forest tree, acres of that thc
i don't smoke but homies do, find the cloud and have a seat
and i wonder how ... live to see 80
i just wanna see mercedes give me head in mercedes
