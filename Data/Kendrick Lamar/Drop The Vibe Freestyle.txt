(work out for me, work out for me)
(work out for me, work out for me)


feeling like a mother fucking animal
hannibal lecter of 2012
elected to execute every rapper that has excelled
if music is your calling
you're falling, pick up yourself
if a nigga said he could see me
bet he told you in braille, fucker
put you in front of the street then buy you some bread
nigga you lunch meat, should've worked at subway instead
goliath couldn't bare my triumph
i'm a leader, walk behind me as i walk through zion
swinging swords like i'm sparring with a spartan
watch they face drop when the beat drop
i drop a real jewel like a martin, fool
me and curtains ballin' like peewee kirkland callin' 'em kirk franklin
stomp 'em, leave 'em hurting
no judgement for a plaintiff
they tried to find me guilty for spitting filthy as o.d.b
but i've been o.d. since '03
that's march 14th, my first recordings
i kicked it like sweet chin
music on chuck norris
