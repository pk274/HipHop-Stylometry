fuck that shit, i'ma blow it up
fuck that shit, i'ma load it up
dump that clip, like a movie script
whether blood or crip, i don't give a fuck
i'ma live it up, my time is now
time and time again, i got that sound
that'll drown, titanic, in atlantic's ocean
i'm hoping that they both go down
nigga please, nigga hand your bitch your keys
so she can push your humvee
to my place we can smoke your weed
pray to god that i'm not god, mc bumped in your ipod
simply i am the cyhi of centennial high, don't give me no tie
i ready made my business mine, decimals are definite
deficate on music mates, and bet, i do it delicate-ly
ignore your celiba-cy and then tell you fuck you
aye what the fuck you want, my fucking dick, you fucking cunt
get off my n-u-t, s, he, yes, got that unorthodox flow
niggas is trapped, they don't hold no grants but they call it 5-0
smash in a el dorado, whip it straight, till the fender break
in the middle of the street, where the criminals be
while i blaze this heat from the taebeast.... tape
