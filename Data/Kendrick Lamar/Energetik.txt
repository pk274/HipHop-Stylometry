uh, back on the block with it
back when i had worn my cousin’s shoes with holes and socks in it
eatin' top ramen, walk to school with a prepaid cellular
crackheads tried to sell me a stolen sox fitted
i tend to look at my upbringing a lot different
from where i’m at i inform you like armonax that i’m two levels of terrific
ya dumb bitch
we in yo hood with the transmissions, ya dumb bitch. yee!
see this is compton at its best, your four-o
and i’m loco as an esé with a fo-loco
and i stay local, i’m from the soil
come from the bottom like the earth’s oil
meet your sihi at the coffee table
all that tough talking just telling me that you poyo
i’m a rare breed, high off life without a gram of weed
kendrick lamar, a block off palma leaves
sip the same palmasa my uncle put me on
this is me!

and it's all copasthetic
