my nigga we out here, four door cutlass
ain't enough room for your luggage
don't trip
you fabricate to the public we donâ€™t believe shit
believe it or not call your bluff then leave your ass wit knots
the juggernaut is in your rectum, call pac and resurrect him
i'm sure to cause a spectrum
especially with my mental telepathy start to f' em aka fuck'em
aka nothings in my way once i start b-b-bucking
fuck up your function and your house party my life's shortly about fortune and vice
if the feds caught me i tread softly the judge toss me life
and your autopsy and my posse came through properly right
everyone's watching me all right if you're not watching me like
sent my big cousin a kite got my shit buzzing when there wasn't even a doorbell, a insect or light year in sight
amen now won't you be a man and pay respects
enjoy as we progress destroy ya baby steps
enjoy son enjoy son
enjoy son enjoy son
enjoy son
