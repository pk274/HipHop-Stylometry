i'm the coolest nigga you know
migrated from the north pole when i was fo'
infatuated with cartoons and g.i. joes
'till something more greater took a toll: life
not really, more like white air nikes
evidently, i had a fondness for material things
ten years old trynna get a 10-k ring
i forgot it was for me when the phone ringed
elementary girls callin' the house
desiree and cheryl mama end hustled what we talkin' about
i'm talkin' about the good old days when we walked without knowing that could be our last time walking out
now we can't walk witout protection
bein' on the defensive, life ills
this life will put you in a crazy world
just by knowing crime will never cure
so i'm strapped like girbaud jeans
i'd rather see the pen like i was bowling
rather than death, walkin' on heavy steps
it's a great place, but i ain't ready for heaven yet
so i told god put me at the back of the line
matter fact yesterday, swear to god i ain't lyin'
movin' at a turtle pace, cause the fast lane got a day one uncle with one in the brain
got one in the chamber
sixteen in the clip, my eyes fluttered with anger
hip-hop trynna save my life
give credit whenever it's due, the money touchin' the roof
breakin' the ceiling, with that being i'm breakin' the loot
with my loved ones, life way too short, son
