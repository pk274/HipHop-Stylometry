and everything you do
lover, lover, lover, lover, lover for you
and everything you do
lover, lover, lover, lover, lover for you


you never knew a love-love-love, a love like this
sophisticated gangsta, watch me thug like this
snatch your bitch in the club like this
seven zeros, need my pub like this
stuck in a rock and a hard place, i am
thinking i wouldn't fuck y’all up, well, i am
i gotta get my shit off
my style come from devin the dude, kurupt too
and james brown with his fist tossed
i fluctuate through vocals likе prince rogers
who evеr thought a billionaire come out of compton?
multiply simple logic, you can do it, nigga, stop it
dre ain't motivation, i don't know who is
gift and a curse, maybe them shoes is too big
or maybe i’m too pessimistic to know i'm gifted
chasing hoodrat brownie points and bullshitting
i lock the door on em, scrape and hopped a fo' on em
drain my cock and po' on em
yeah nigga, i'm still talking that whooptie whoop
hoppin' out on my enemy, i know who to shoot


and everything you do
lover, lover, lover, lover, lover for you
and everything you do
lover, lover, lover, lover, lover for you


back with my niggas where i need to be
such a familiar scenery, i smelled the gun smoke
i watched the homie watch his son smoke
i watched the sun set on my set
i seen one 'ru and one loc
one slipping, one played 'em close
everything’s fucked up nowadays
compton crip card kill each other faster than the opposite color
niggas wack out everything, your dead homies, your mother, your newborn brother
if god was a loc, he’d prolly have one coming
damn, that's fucked up
that’s how it is when you can't trust not a soul inside these streets
i made a video out there in cape town so the homie can see
to let him know it's more than just parmalee
he said, "good luck", and paused the video the moment his phone ring
that fast dollar was his only problem
no matter how many flicks of tabletop mountain
the block was home and africa was too far for power
then i knew


and everything you do
lover, lover, lover, lover, lover for you
and everything you do
lover, lover, lover, lover, lover for you


i promised dave i'd never say the phrase "fuck nigga"
he said, "think about what you saying: "fuck niggas"
no better than samuel l. on the django
no better than a white man with slave boats"
sound like i needed some soul searching
taz arnold gave me some game in real person
retraced my steps on what they never taught me
did my homework fast before government caught me
so i’ma dedicate my last verse to oprah
on how the infamous, ignorant n-word control us
so many artists gave her an explanation to hold us
well, this is my explanation straight from ethiopia
n-e-g-u-s definition: royalty; king royalty, oprah, listen
n-e-g-u-s description: black emperor, king, ruler, now let me finish
the history books overlook the word and hide it
america tried to make it to a house divided
the homies don't recognize we been using it wrong
so i'ma break it down and put this game in a song
n-e-g-u-s, say it with me, or say no more
'lluminati can come and get me
calling for oprah winfrey, all debates aside
kendrick lamar, by far, realest nigga alive


and everything you do
lover, lover, lover, lover, lover for you
and everything you do
lover, lover, lover, lover, lover for you
