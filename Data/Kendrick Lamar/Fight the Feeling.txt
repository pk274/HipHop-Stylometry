sometimes i wake up, up in the morning, make her
wrap this much make-up off my bed, soon as she's yawnin', take up
hours upon days just to find power shit to say
but you won't hear it even if your ears was pierced with beats by dre, i mean
the sun is slowly fallin', we all surely should die eventually
so what's your calling? oh, you left your phone behind?
identity crisis, break mirrors, vices steer us through wickedness
jesus christ is right near us, and devil said you owe ten percent
sold your soul, i know, sold your soul and you're hopeless
my focus, stare at elopin' on boats that float in the open of oceans
that coast the line on the margins i rhyme, you chokin' or soakin' up game
i'm hopin' you picked the second one, shame
the emotion of jealousy that you're holdin', you're tellin' me
that you're golden but really cubic zirconia, let me see
i'll break you down like a pound of fire, whenever
your tactics are mighty clever but even if you're mayweather you
