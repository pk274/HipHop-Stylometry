overlooking the skyline
double-checking every rule in the guidelines
i can see it with twenty-twenty vision
partition and tell 'em that it's my time
two time for the city which i came
crack policies, crack cocaine
crack a bottle on the porch
crack a bad bitch in a porsche
when it rains, i make sure i don't have an umbrella
benjamins falling from a cloud
send a missile at your pathetic propellers
screaming that fly shit
emergency land now
i mean, i can show you way better than tell you
i know that thеy know you, but know they can't help you
do what you supposed to or jump bеhind pro tools and die
you're living a lie


i heard a melody on your corner
and it was dedicated to you
it said, "don't worry, we got now"
do you believe that's true?
you know i'm right
so for life, we go


flashlight, so bright, like
stadium, high beam, high
we glow, we glow, like
these stars, woah, woah, woah
flashlight (flashlight)
flashlight (flashlight)
flashlight (flashlight)
flashlight
we glow, we glow, like
stadium, woah, woah, woah


fuckin' up the premises, i been a dick
ain't beneficial, i'm 'bout to issue your nemesis
evacuate the buildin' when i come through
evaluate your feelings when i come through
tire marks and gun smoke stories
ogs reminisce and show glory
he said, "nigga, i'm hopin' you make a way out
before i make this mac-11 do it for me"
i know responsibility weighin' down on my shoulders
summertime always the coldest
niggas do you dirty like the projects
25? then you are the oldest
this is the feelin' you get when you ride
'til the wheels fall off and there's no mo' drive
i see the fear when i look in your eyes
we livin a lie
