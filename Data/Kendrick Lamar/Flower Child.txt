they say greatness get better with time
they say concrete roses hard to find
sit inside my room, and let these thoughts bloom
it's a secret garden in my mind
flower child


when the lights get low and you notice i am the sun
the winter time was snow but only little you know
i will still breathe, give me the keys
i'm resuscitating the game, see me in cpr
my name is a gun cocked, gun shot
dead and i won't stop
gun cocked, gun shot
head in a pine box
with a dozen roses, hold this with a gift card
gun cocked, gun shot
flowers on your momma's yard


they say greatness get better with time
they say concrete roses hard to find
sit inside my room, and let these thoughts bloom
it's a secret garden in my mind
flower child
