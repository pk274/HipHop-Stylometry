fuck your ethnicity, nigga


fire burning inside my eyes, this the music that saved my life
y'all be calling it hip-hop, i be calling it hypnotize
yeah, hypnotize, trapped my body, but freed my mind
what the fuck are you fighting for? ain't nobody gon' win that war
my details be retail, man, i got so much in store
racism is still alive, yellow tape and colored lines
fuck that, nigga, look at that line, it's so diverse
they gettin' off work and they wanna see kendrick
everybody can't drive benzes, and i been there, so i make it my business
to give 'em my full attention, ten-hut, man, i gotta get my wind up
man, i gotta get down with god 'cause i got my sins up, ooh
matter fact, don't mistake me for no fuckin' rapper
they sit backstage and hide behind them fuckin' cameras
i mosh pit, had a microphone and i tossed it
had a brain, then i lost it
i'm out of my mind, so don't you mind how much the cost is
penny for my thoughts, everybody, please hold up your wallets
yeah, man, i'm the mailman, can't you tell, man?
gone postal, never freeze up when i approach you
that's starstruck and roast you, oh my
hiiipower


reporting live from planet terminator x

now, i don't give a fuck if you
black, white, asian, hispanic, goddammit
that don't mean shit to me
fuck your ethnicity, nigga


i'm tired of y'all, 'cause everybody lied to y'all
and you believe it? recognize them false achievements
it's treason and i'm tylenol, i knock out when you knock it off
knock on the doors of opportunity, i'm too involved
i'm no activist, i'm no einstein
before calculus, i was kicking that math
dropping that science like an alchemist and i be kicking that ass
lyrically, i'm ufc
if a ufo had came for me, i'ma come back with the head of an alien
don't alienate my dreams
get it right, get a life, i got two
that's a metaphor for the big shit i do
boy, tmi, tsa, man, i'm fly
put wings on my back
that a plane or an angel? both
like a pilot with a halo, woah
gross


i mean, i've seen so many things come through them, him, her, you, mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm
i'm just a messenger
yeah, i know life's a bitch, get the best of her
put them threes up, they notice that we up
hiiipower and the power in the people and if they don't believe us
they'll die
wizard


now, i don't give a fuck if you
black, white, asian, hispanic, goddammit
that don't mean shit to me
fuck your ethnicity, nigga
