um, yeah, tell 'em put my name on a blimp
ball like i'm derrick rose, ho, know my gym
you playa's not allowed i'm spikin' your game towel
and hittin' your gatorade with gasoline i'm foul
i'm in the crowd like artest and them
i move the crowd like artest and them
punchlines mean i really go punch civilians
crunch time mean i take it to the hole
not this basket but rather the good p*ssy that i'm in
i assassin you niggas, i make your weight turn thin
blank tapes to your deck, niggas still brеak their neck
to hear it you need clеarance with the label just to win
i need to clear it with the bank just to spin
club appearance that's 15 racks when you get it like that, shit, it's gotta be a sin
lord forgive me, yes i'm a sinner
but these hoes squeeze me cause i'm a winner
back when we ate canned food for dinner
i coach fools to protools make my agenda
i show fools, i'm tofu nasty, i wish a
motherf*cker would get your whole career injured
that's assault what a deadly weapon
i killed your favorite rapper, favorite rapper last record
i f*cked your baby actress on the map just what a blessing
make that p*ssy ante up she made my d*ck anti-depressive
i'm really not impressed with, none of you niggas stressing
that's some of you niggas bless with the gift to carry the presence
of b.i.g & 'pac and i'm popping big shit with label investments
15 minutes turn into 60 seconds
last week, i spit 12 hours inside of session
came up with shit writers block niggas up in here stressing
like who the fuck cares? who the fuck cares?
even if you get slumped, dawg, you'll still be a millionaire
niggas play a santa claus and make sure you hold dear
every verse i put that bitch in the hearse, while flex steer
uh church to you pussies, you push me get pap smeared
burst out your cookie, i read it, my fortune is here
