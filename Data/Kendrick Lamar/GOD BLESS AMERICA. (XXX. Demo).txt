throw a steak off the ark to a pool full of sharks
he'll take it
leave him in the wilderness with a sworn nemesis
he'll make it (he'll make it)
take the gratitude from him, i bet he'll show you somethin'
woah (woah)
i chip a nigga lil' bit of nothin'
i chip a nigga lil' bit of nothin'
i chip a nigga lil' bit of nothin'
i chip a nigga, then throw the blower in his lap
walk myself to the court like, "bitch, i did that!," x-rated
johnny don't wanna go to school no mo', no mo'
johnny said books ain't cool no mo' (no mo')
johnny wanna be a rapper like his big cousin
johnny caught a body yesterday out hustlin'
god bless america, you know we all love him


yesterday, i got a call, like, from my dawg, like 101
said they killed his only son because of insufficient funds
he was sobbin', he was mobbin', way belligerent and drunk
talkin' out his head, philosophin' on what the lord had done
he said: "k-dot, can you pray for me? it been a fucked up day for me
i know that you anointed, show me how to overcome."
he was lookin' for some closure, hopin' i could bring him closer
to the spiritual, my spirit do know better, but i told him
"i can't sugarcoat the answer for you, this is how i feel:
if somebody kill my son, that mean somebody gettin' killed."
tell me what you do for love, loyalty, and passion of
all the memories collected, moments you could never touch
i wait in front a nigga's spot and watch him hit his block
i catch a nigga leavin' service if that's all i got
i chip a nigga, then throw the blower in his lap
walk myself to the court like, "bitch, i did that!"
ain't no black power when your baby killed by a coward
i can't even keep the peace, don't you fuck with one of ours
it be murder in the street, it be bodies in the hour
ghetto bird be on the street, paramedics on the dial
let somebody touch my momma, touch my sister, touch my woman
touch my daddy, touch my niece, touch my nephew, touch my brother
you should chip a nigga, then throw the blower in his lap
matter fact, i'm 'bout to speak at this convention, call you backâ€”
