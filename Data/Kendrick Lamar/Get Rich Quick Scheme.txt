sitting here thinking about how to get my money up today
cause my change is looking a little strange
maybe i should just go and rob a bank
(but i need money for the guns)
and my shoes kinda old so i can't be on the run
need to climb up on a cool million
cause a 9 to 5 just ain't an option


i'm tired of living pity broke
as i promise all the levies that was in in o (?)
i hit the bank to withdraw the tellers tell me in o'
i wanna have commas and live with common rich folk
you know the oprahs and the russells
with the hustle that can put me number six on the forbes list
ignore my troubles with a duffel
