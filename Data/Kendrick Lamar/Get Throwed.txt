i got my air-conditioning on right now
real cool about it
oil talking please
slick with it


wanna know what death feel like
i suggest that you stay in the house at night
the scope that i got for the long rifle fit pretty damn right
plus my connect got a pretty good price
i could take off your neck with just one slice of the blade
no, i'm not wesley snipes
one cut can have her screaming out first aid
been this way ever since first grade
forte demeanour was to get paid
birthday solution was to shoot straight
thirteen i was ready for gunplay
stand on the block taking pay
i get four shots like a freak oh he know
not to fuck with k-d-o-t
oh, i forgot
never come around here without a glock
you want beef with your boy
nigga i put heat on your boy
leave him tied up on the back seat
with your boy duct taped won't let out noise
oh yes we got them toys
oh yes we got them choppas
lapd they can't stop us
rockets shoot down helicopters
in the kitchen (in the kitchen)
betty crocker (betty crocker)
got kick (got kick)
you hate (you hate)
you wait (you wait)
one sec (one sec)
i'll be back we then gon' west
no vest, i'ma aim at your face
unless you can stop them
i'm so throwed
oh yes people there is a problem
i say


(know what i'm talking bout?
i can feel that lane
sometimes i just lay back and let them look at me
i'm so
