baby got a nigga feeling like kid again
make the homie wanna go and have a kid and then
marry on an island probably on a private boat
total silence while we gliding on hawaii's coast
body of a goddess, brains of a harvard student
her intellect can intercept the brightest star moving
hear the horns playing? they playing for that girl
i ain't playing i plan to go around the world
might settle down, like fuck bitches
call the homies up, i'm in love nigga
can you believe that?
she gonna follow where my lead at
high off life quit then relapse
you heat them horns playing? they playing for that women
she think a nigga on, i think im on to something

let's-let's, talk-talk, bout-bout trust
let's-let's, talk-talk, bout-bout you
let's-let's, talk-talk, bout-bout us
let's talk about our love
and when it's said and done
give me some of you, you

give me some of you, you
give me some of you, you


and so i ask myself
how it feel to be with somebody that you define
as the perfect human that shaped under his design
god almighty
golly, you probably over-shadow sunshine
man i feel sorry
for them hoes that's playing catch up inside the city
or catching feelings when they hearing that you fucking with me
or i'm fucking with you, that's the vise versa
i'm feeling it, you killing it, where them big hearses
you hear them horns playing? they playing for that diva
i'm paying for that ros√©, i'm paying for that reefer
cause this a celebration
i'm serenading every occasion now peep my cadance
i break it down love
you break it down love, then bring it back up
fuck in front of the mirror, break it till we get bad luck
you hear tham horns playing? they playing for that queen
i think i'm really on, cause she on my team
