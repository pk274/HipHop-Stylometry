i used to be sceptical about this rap shit
now i'm a professional at this rap shit
cause one verse can make the paralysed backflip
don't compare guys to me, if jesus could rap
they'd compare god to me, i'm special like that
i move like a freight train over these tracks
run through you like wet doodle, that's what i'm doin'
shittin' on niggas, perform bowel movements
who you, you ain't up to par keeler
nah keeler, you're word patterings is kinda off keeler
you ain't sick enough, you just a cough keeler
i bring pneumonia to california
say hello to mr. west now
who's the best on the west now?
k.dot, jay rock hands down
anybody that feel different
you die first class on a cemetery visit, keeler


i'm so far ahead of my time
i'm 'bout to start my third life
shit i feel like i've died already twice
then reincarnated and become your unborn grandchild's favourite
i got three brains to play with
i'm so far ahead of my time
i gotta say this shit again
but this time i came back
double time, rebirth as a twin
feet first i'm a mother smooth
like deja vu, times two, now
you could probably dodge a bullet
but see we put your body parts in shopping carts
till them bums push it
you on the edge nigga don't push it
'fore the fifth turn you head crooked
i sit your monkey ass down
and best believe, it won't be on no damn cushion
a casket full of thorn bushes
move the shit while the fiends look
call the cops, shush
