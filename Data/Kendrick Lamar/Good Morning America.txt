good morning, america (ahh)
(wake up, wake up, wake up)
the saga continues
good morning, america (ahh)
(wake up, wake up, wake up)
'cause as the gold daytons spin
(wake up, wake up, wake up)
a new revelation
good morning, america (ahh)


good morning, america
a new day, we gotta hit the schedule ahead of us
the letter k, d-o-t, add a space like a microsoft keypad
you can't see me, invisible ski mask
poke the eyes out my beanie
ghetto zorro on the headlines, i leave
feces, shit on niggas, nigga
my flow come in plural
multiple of it, majority love it
i got the masses, meaning societies, public
low dickie shorts, l.a. fashion still holding grudges
ain't forgot y'all killed pac, niggas
ain't forgot y'all left the west coast for dead
tried to play it off like the paramedics was coming
instead, we dusted off, pulled the bullet out our heads
left a permanent scar for the whole world to recognize
california, economics, pay your taxes bitch


it's a new day
new chronic, new hundred spoke, new six tray
new snoop, new 2pac, new doc dre
a new west coast to wake up to, nate


good morning, america
as a new day begins, the saga continues
a new breeze stepping in
i hope that you're ready
'cause as the gold daytons spin, brings forth new life
a new revelation (the second coming is here)
show you right


oh, you done fucked up, baby
young kendrick, the grown up baby
on enough to acknowledge your fuck ups
maybe i spare your life, maybe i won't
maybe i give you the funk
geroge clinton, bring my sentence like i got a english major in it
this is higher academics, pay attention, students
niggas, what was you foolin' with a handgun?
might as well have a harpoon, then
i carry two or more with me like i'm carpoolin'
we mobb deep when it's beef
i don't say "get 'em," i say "move in"
s.w.a.t team so aggressive, turn a minor problem extreme
kool-aid red beam on top of my weapon
notice my professionalism, i'm perfecting my craft
you niggas is half doin' your job, insubordination
i'mma have the boss get you fired
oh, i am the boss
get terminated, bitch


it's a new day
new chronic, new hundred spoke, new six tray
new snoop, new 2pac, new doc dre
a new west coast, don't wake up too late


good morning, america
as a new day begins, the saga continues
a new breeze stepping in
i hope that you're ready
'cause as the gold daytons spin, brings forth new life
a new revelation (the second coming is here)
show you right


the moral is try your best to not collide with the best of 'em
i ain't talkin' 'bout you, i talk about jay, nas, and em
crème de la crème, homie
pockets fat, hand boney
how is that?
kinda ironic, the west coast, i underline it
make him my priority, in orderly fashion, i ain't livin' in
nobody lasted in time, nobody closing your blinds
the sun is shining, bitch


it's a new day
new chronic, new hundred spoke, new six tray
new snoop, new 2pac, new doc dre
a new west coast, don't wake up too late


good morning, america
as a new day begins, the saga continues
a new breeze stepping in
i hope that you're ready
'cause as the gold daytons spin, brings forth new life
a new revelation (the second coming is here)
show you right


my nigga, hahahaha
roll your window down, start there
ahahaha
see, you gotta hear the street
you gotta be snortin', you know
you gotta taste that shit, feel that
learn that shit, brotha
learn that shit, that shit will get you killed
these mothafuckas plottin' all kinds of shit behind your back
shit
