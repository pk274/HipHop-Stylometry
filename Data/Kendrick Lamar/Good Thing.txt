the sky, it's upside down
your wife's in the graveyard
her husband finally has her
the police are closing in on him
if he had a comprar, her and i
i'd fight it, we'd fight it
i need the help i need


ain't no reason why (why i kill)
it wasn't the right time (right time to fill)
and i'm so glad i did (my blood in you)
and i'm like, why am i so alone? (why, why)
and i'm like, oh, god i know (god, god)
this is going to be different this time (differ, different)
and i'm like why don't we just try to forget it (forget it)
