what it do homie?, it's your young boy god given
your unnecessary spending show how you're living
them diamonds in your grill won't you take 'em out
'fore i pistol whip your jaw and spank 'em out your mouth
i'll show 'em what a real hijack's about
take everything scrape the change from under the couch
platinum to rose gold, it's gettin' sold
whatever's left the dentist figure it out
put the hog to 'em or trick em out
watch me barge through 'em like rottweilers and pitbulls
we ain't ate yet, and you lookin' fools
17 shots in the clip got the chamber full
bang, yeah, you're looking kinda right
now it's time to say goodnight, so glad that you came
bang, one more just because you made my trigger finger sore
now, give me diamond rings
