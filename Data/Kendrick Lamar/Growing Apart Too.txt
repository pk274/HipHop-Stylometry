so in conclusion
sometimes we lose focus
planning our whole demise
we’re getting the big picture and making it the wallet size
so to what's important in my life, i apologize
i hope to stay faithful, focused and sanctified
we all get distracted
the question is would you bounce back, or bounce back wards?
you wouldn’t know how to act or would you take action?
that's just a part of life and if your vision's impaired
you'll probably lose it all tonight
