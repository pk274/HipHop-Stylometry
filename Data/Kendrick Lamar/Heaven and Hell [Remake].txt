niggas hating, bitches hating, babies dying
bullets flying, helicopters, police sirens, preachers lying
genocism, criticism, unemployment, racism
burning buildings, aids victims, cancer killing no cure
oil spilling, turmoil, poverty stricken, police brutality
kicking ass of us africans, hostages in afghanistan
not to mention another prison, child molesting
cow intestines, botox injections, earthquakes that's government tested
secret society weapon, opium plant manifested
then turn to crack then invested amongst us blacks just a message
to hold us back, great depression amongst iraq, no direction no google map
just a tec for the soo-woop swerving, izuzu then blap blap blap
adolescents go coocoo, mothers are boohoo crying
the governor keeps us starving, these commercials keep us buying
these cigarettes supermarkets fill up our liver with triumph
distincted livin' with science, no place to live in, no zion
see that's forbidden, we fryin'


malcolm laughing, martin laughing, biggie spittin'
pac is rapping, gregory tappin, people singing, bells is ringing
children playing, angels praying, 14 karat golden streets, collard greens
red wine, potato yams, turkey legs...
