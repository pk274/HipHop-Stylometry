reporting live from where reporters die
newscasters coming too early witnessing homocides
pearly gates forming in the sky as we wait for your suit and tie
i tailor-made it for you then told khalifa he loves you
i'm really stuck on this bumpy ride
highway to hell 'less i flip through a demon's tv-guide
an angel said he seen me fry
ducking bullets
i promise i couldn't stop the work my niggas have put in
your brains is banana pudding
i'm looking for trouble, looking for hustle
i'm a grinder, choppas in the path finder
i ain't no killa, i ain't no drug dealer
i'm a real nigga with real emotions that stand behind a
brick wall, you knock it down then i'm forced to align ya
with the stars of venus and jupiter
you ain't ain't gangsta, you fooling us
the government don't know what to do with us
internal affairs investigate while lapd speculate
crooked cops on my bumper dumping 'til i'm first 48
i can smell a snake a mile away because they reek hate
but any anaconda can die on a weekday
wikipedia speeding up my career like i've been here
and i don't fuck with these fuck rappers cause they been weird
been on my dick, get addicted to dying quick
grab a dictionary, my styles vary, my words flip
grab a cemetery and jump in it you jive turkey
watching me through goggles, i throw hollows at james worthy
spin your head like an owl, i'm wild, i drive fergies
that's that white thing, let my nuts & mic hang
no one ever knows the drama that i might bring
chilling with the drama king, but this ain't broadway, mane
armed forces, more fortune, alarm porsches
bitch gorgeous, bomb head like civil war and
y'all snorin', we tourin' and bottle pourin'
model scorin', cheat the game with fair warnings
