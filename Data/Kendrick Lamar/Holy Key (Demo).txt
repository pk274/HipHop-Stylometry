everything i touch may disintegrate into dust (uh huh)
everything i trust may dishonor me in disgust (come on)
everything is everything, affidavits and wedding rings
out for blood on my higher horse, i report what it was
i don't wear crosses no more, yeshua's coming back
i ain't scared of losses no more, i see life in that
i don't resonate with the concept of love and hate
cause your perspective is less effective and rather fake
the universe and the heavens work in my dna
kendrick said "fuck mother earth," that's psa
the land of the wicked, the foundation of lucifer's spirit
walking zombies and spellcatchers, i pray for forgiveness
uncle bobby and paul june is lost again
the underworld and the fourth dimension, my family's in
the big money, the fast cars, my life produced
the blocks i connected while re-building this rubik's cube
so what you look up to?
fame and fortune, bitches, porsches
sources with designer thing
brand endorsement joining forces with sorcerers signing me
law enforcement their forces, tortures us with violent speed
fuck your boss's employment my joy is to see all you bleed
two new royce's with choices of color my desire need
crab and oyster with gorgeous abortions, i require thee
flesh and poison the point is the reason
you won't die in peace
open door for my boy, now they eating, we say, finally
i destroy and divorce what you eating, don't you hire me
tape recording my voices and tweak it
let's play hide and seek
war distortion and forfeit this evening, you should try at least
i'm restoring the portrait of feasting, nigga, i am beast
i don't like to sleep, i'm up like coyote, i might od
hair like odb, i'm off a higher need
khaled is valid, i been looking for inspiration
but when you the only king, you the only one in the matrix
