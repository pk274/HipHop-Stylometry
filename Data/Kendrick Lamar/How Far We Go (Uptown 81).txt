my turbulence put a burden on young herbs
once it's crackin' it's a chain reaction minus yung berg
i'm on the verge of excellence kill em off with no evidence
take a shot at the excorcist then x em out with these words
panoramic views be tumblin' out my mind
this ain't 1992 bullets tumblin' out no nines
big ak's like alicia keys abbreviated
and nowadays niggas stand behind em like clive davis
clyde drexler, before the hood got dribbled niggas right up on the stretcher
an understatement said that k. lamar was under pressure
don't press ya luck when i'm pressed for time
cuz when the press get this verse, their sure to press rewind
the president's prayer can't save us in my cul-de-sac
there's codeine, crack and cognac enough violence to keep the devil smilin' while we whilin' on them corners with them ropes and rats
nigga build a trap house, hope his homies don't run his trap
see the feds and tap out that's wrestler shit
don't rest your case as a gangsta because you wrestled your bitch
we move in silence, like the potato tip when we ridin'
and we ride rotten, 2 choppers found dirty sirens
you ain't been where i been, i know where i'm goin'
and life's a bitch, i know that she hoing
i know what i'm sewing, what i reap
i know that i'm flowing like water from sea or water from creek
and if i don't speak, i know you ain't growin
cuz i'm a leader, respect it when you see em
accepted by yo new bitch, yo old bitch and yo bm
y'all always on that bs and ps i'm takin all fades
i'm takin off first, this g6 is on it's way
