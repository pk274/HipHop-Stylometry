i kick a funky friendly conversation that keep they mind racin'
you can't complain about the flow i got
i let my thoughts space out with the astronauts
like the white boys say, "pass the pot"

let me smoke for a minute...

as god as my witness, i never abuse this hip hop
i'll never pretend to be something i'm not
giving you something to rock to other than hardcore rap, possible
you ever been under hypnosis i mean literally
not being focused with your eyes open
they say 90% of humans don't even notice
now can you imagine a couple of minutes passing without you knowing what happened
without you knowing people was laughing at you
they say the worse scenario is when they have to catch you
you wake up out of your mind, your whole thoughts is baffled
you're doing things like trying to touch your shadow
now here's some realistic, is it something that can happen or is it just a gimmick
you never know until your bear witness
bear witness...
bear witness...


you woke up in the morning, took a shower
call some bitches over, want them to be over in one hour
she came over, you fucked
she left and you hopped in the truck, you
took your shirt off cause outside was burning up, you
skirted off turned your beat up but your gun was tucked
under the seat, you headed to long beach
hop on the 710 the carpool lane
only cause you got black tint and they can't see a thing
your check engine light popped up, its feeling like bad luck or what not
you tried to maneuver all the way to the call box
but one lane before you got there your car stopped

stop

if your was listening for the past two minutes
then you just made accurate 90% hypnosis
