wake up
i know only, trapped in the belly of the beast and it's hungry
if i can't lay up in the streets i feel lonely
if i gotta break up with the streets i feel lonely


wake up
i know only, trapped in the belly of the beast and it's hungry
if i can't lay up in the streets i feel lonely
if i gotta break up with the streets i feel lonely


wake up
i know only, trapped in the belly of the beast and it's hungry
if i can't lay up in the streets i feel lonely
if i gotta break up with the streets i feel lonely


we ain't chose this type of living, it's what we gotta do
part of niggas hear us cripping and drop out of school
selling drugs or they pimping like some prostitutes
living in a nightmare, pinching is what you gotta do
wake up
