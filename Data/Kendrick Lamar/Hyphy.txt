freestyle up in here
i'm at paid dues doin' my thing
k-dot, kendrick lamar, man
i'm from the bay, ya-da-da
and i've got money and i'm sayin', 'ya-da-da'
got the long hair, curly hair
i got the ti$a on, that's the clothes that i wear
you got the ray-ban glasses
so many girls in the crowd and they got fat asses
thirty-pounders, eighty-pounder
where she at, man? i'm a down her
i'm a drown her, i'm a down her, a shower
