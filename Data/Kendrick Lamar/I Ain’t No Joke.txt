i ain't no joke i used to let the mic smoke
now i'm like mike jordan with the flow
identify with a scientific scope
scope over the rifle
fragments and potholes
got rappers selling surveillance behind black tint in the parking lot at roscoes
making the change lift straight jack move
pack 2 some mechanic
pull it out you panic, flow nuts like cashews
shift to cancun, even though i’m compton
like raider caps and corduroy house shoes
i be the illest witness the lyrical drug dealin’
when i distribute the word these rappers get hard feelings
no remorse sucka mc’s throw fits cause i carry the torch without olympics
kill all friendships my enemies
go against the god mc? penalty crucifixion
so nice wish you had 3 ear drums to listen
damn right i be the don corleone of rap songs whether on the east cost or back home
we clap chrome like magnetic monkey wrenches
used to hop fences
now we hop on top of bad bitches pass em to the homies like basketball assists
west coast vengeance, east coast revenue something new like
pac in versace lenses big in the khaki suit
best of both worlds when i step in the booth
suicidal thugs from them him her and you
i kick away the chair you hang from the noose
shoutout to sidegun and papoose, kunta kinte and ?
bringing it back to the roots, you understand
