draped in stone like i gazed at medusa
download my audio and blow up your computers
spit that conglomerate shit, the shit that you ain't used to
shit so strong, the unborn can smell it in the future
they'll sell it and theyâ€™ll shoot ya
a mom and pop store sold out
and the fan killed the clerk over my music
is that real?
realer than me at 16, writing sixteens, battled and dismantled six teens
all for the love of hip-hop, i would still rap
even if rodman came back and my disc flopped
thats an analogy built with substance
fuck an award, my metaphor is for the public
you forging your signature on my culture then insult the great k.dot
i gotta catapult you, bye bye
i wake up in the morning then compose a bar
flow reckless like the first time you driven a car
perfected, from years of dedication
wrote my first 50 songs and then i graduated
with my bachelor's
and if you hearing this verse, i probably got my masters
and by the end of this verse, i'm your favorite rapper
