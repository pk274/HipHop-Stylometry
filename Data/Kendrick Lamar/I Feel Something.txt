i'm up and down, i'm unenthused
happy then i'm paralyzed by other moods
temporary pleasures runnin' out of fuel
to see there's an exit is impossible
chasin' worry, chasin' program
distorted the ways of the world again
good decisions, wishin' i knew more of them
concepts of you and who i am


there's a hold on me, and it strengthens
there's a troubled spirit, hard to explain, yeah, yeah
i feel somethin', i feel somethin'
sometimes reverence, huh, sometimes pain, huh
sometimes both of them, it's hard to explain, yeah, yeah
i feel somethin', i feel somethin'

i feel somethin', i feel somethin'
