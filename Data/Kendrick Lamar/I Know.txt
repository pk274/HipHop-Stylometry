yeah, come on, she wanna roll, i know
catch me in the cut with a cup of the juice
i’m chilling, believe this, i’m jesus to women
they all want to jump in my coupe like a pigeon
smokey on friday, find me on the highway
middle finger up, not giving a fuck
like a nun who masturbates, congratulate
the 
and you ain’t gotta say my name is on point cause
and you ain’t gotta say my game is on point cause
i know, i know, i know, i know, i know, i know
you ain’t gotta say my game is on point cause
and you ain’t gotta say my name is on point cause


and you ain’t gotta say my name is on point cause
and you ain’t gotta say my game is on point cause
i know, i know, i know, i know, i know, i know
you ain’t gotta say my game is on point cause
and you ain’t gotta say my name is on point cause
