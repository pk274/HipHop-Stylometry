music is my life
the reason why i write
like edgar allan poe on the beat, like a parasite
you thought a parachute made my flow just fall out the sky
then you fell apart into a body part no one would buy
nobody tried my limits 'cause they're afraid of heights
the ambition, weak or gravity, let 'em die
i let you live until a nigga compose a rhyme
then it's like a rhino in your ass every time
time and time again i treat my pen like the pen
bars harder than pelican bay and i been
servin' a life sentence since the day i was ten
nine times outta ten you only ten songs deep before you leap
into a pool of sharks then swim
that's an analogy on the way i do casualties
and i do this shit casually, before the verse end
i'll be in the hall of fame with my picture framed, friend
