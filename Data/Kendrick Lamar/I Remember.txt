sox gang
i'm wearing black pumas, hair like kunta
kendrick lamar
'bout eight of them in the studio
and the all want me
fuck you niggas bruh
skeme whaddup


driving on a freeway full of darkness
it's just me and plus my heart is cold
as an project carpet
you be coughing up commode
full of shit see i was told
that only real niggas can harvest any future pot of gold
and look at you, i know you starving, see it's burning in your soul
and you look for me to console your emotions
i'm on the road and i'm joking with all my niggas
we laughing at you the feeling of victory is a gig
and i hope they catch you whenever you fall from the pedestal you was on
and don't get me wrong, you was in the zone of a lifetime
but the place you belong is the bottom
that's why i got a bullet for every ego or tuxedo
and some scenos, a combination that we know
uh, tight rope, but i notice they walk a thin line
from having the disabilities of deaf, dumb and blind
every time i recline, then remind myself
i would never die with pussy, less it was on my dick, pussy
