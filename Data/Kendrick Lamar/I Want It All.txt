tell him i do deniro, tell him you do camaro
i do a fast car, something like a nascar
move like a sh-sh-sh-shooting star
and they know who we are, big pimping in the building
got about a million, throw it at the ceiling
layin' smack dead in the face of civilians
tell 'em i'm chilling with patron on ice
and my home on ice, and my neck on ice
lo-lo-lo-look at my ring, i'm a hustler string
you should learn me twice
i'mma grind till i die, that's no lie
do with my middle finger held up high
fuck the world, if it fry
i know one thing, i did my job
and that's get what? move, tell a lie
sippin on henny, smokin on ly
never let a penny pass me by
move with the benjis by my side
that's my sidekick, you better watch it
what i mean is, don't touch my pockets
man big debts, cut them checks
hundred mill plus, nothing less
