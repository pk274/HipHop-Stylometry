ride like it's four wheel drive (ride)
ride till we forklift the tires (ride)
ride and we never get tired, ride on our enemies
crime chemistry got me hemorrhaging blood out my memory
i'm ted bundy if the money exist (ah, nah)
al bundy 'cause my other hand is gripping my dick, ain't nothing funny, bitch
monopolize my prophecy, they watching me thru binoculars
obviously, bitch, i'm pac in these wallabees
wanna-be's wanna be me, take one of these then take it easy
the lord wants you and forbes list need me
lord forgive me for my ways, i blame it on how i was raised
inside of a cage, praying with slaves
compton, california, the coroner work for seven days
throughout the week, you might as well leap yourself to a grave
lunges out a bottomless pit, bottles of hennessy
guzzle another fifth, pop a pill then pop in the clip
pop a shot then circle the block, then you just repeat it again
ammo, reincarnated, rambo, now tell a friend, motherfucker
