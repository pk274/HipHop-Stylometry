uh
straight out the gate, i represent for every section 8
housing in compton, there's more to accomplish
the bomb, hiroshima's atomic
my palm over the book of psalms, promise to god i keep it honest
mind over matter, my subject matters are landmines
i'm on a bubble like a scantron, my hustle
got nipsey on his toes, we 'bout to pimp this game
like a book of cheat codes, word to rock and ab-soul
schoolboy q, money longer than any jewel
that's how we tryna get it and if you say you got it
i'm sure you gotta take it back like enterprise cars that's rented
we authentic, you're all bitches, no pun intended
yeah, yeah, i'm 'bout to turn it up this year, bro
bustin' through your earlobes, they all wanna rock
i don't know if i'm k.dot or a guitar hero
ever since like a year old, knew i would see these euros
trips overseas like an extra'd out blood
protection out 'cause i know they hate to show me love
my apron out, 'cause i like to really cook it up
soufflé for any jigga, lupe, eminem or andré
weezy f. baby or any rapper hot from the '80s
i'm a competitor, they wanna put they
money on me, i'd rather them send they checks to haiti
that's more important than me fillin' your ass with poison
quite frankly, you can't change me
so put me in your cd changer and admit this a banger
i admit, i'm a stranger to givin' up
no exceptions, make your girl famous for givin' butt
since '87, i been a blessin' to bless y'all
close your eyes, play track number five, and see god
copped this state of mind, that's the state of mines
i make my city make noise, you just make your moms
see the godfather, i could probably date your moms
make ab the godfather when i fuck a couple times, haha
like call me guitar hero, or call me dada
sister days of dada, i been on my shit, nigga
and you ain't shit, nigga
just shit on a shingle and if they shit on my single
i'll be loadin' up the nana clip, ready to mingle
i take it personal and all west djs the first to go


not all of 'em
just some
