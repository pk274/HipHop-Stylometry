what money got to do with it
when i don't know the full definition of a rap image?
i'm trapped inside the ghetto and i ain't proud to admit it
institutionalized, i keep runnin' back for a visit, hol' up
get it back
i said i'm trapped inside the ghetto and i ain't proud to admit it
institutionalized, i could still kill me a nigga, so what?


life, can be like, a box of chocolate
quid pro quo, somethin' for somethin', that's the obvious
oh shit, flow's so sick, don't you swallow it
bitin' my style, you're salmonella poison positive
i can just alleviate the rap industry politics
milk the game up, never lactose intolerant
the last remainder of real shit, you know the obvious
me, scholarship? no, streets put me through colleges
be all you can be, true, but the problem is
dream only a dream if work don't follow it
remind me of the homies that used to know me, now follow this
i'll tell you my hypothesis, i'm probably just way too loyal
k dizzle will do it for you, my niggas think i'm a god
truthfully all of 'em spoiled, usually, you're never charged
but somethin' came over you once i took you to them fuckin' bet awards
you lookin' at artistses like they're harvestses
so many rollies around you and you want all of 'em
somebody told me you thinkin' 'bout snatchin' jewelry
i should've listened when my grandmama said to me:


"fuck am i 'posed to do when i'm lookin' at walkin' licks?
the constant big money talk 'bout the mansion and foreign whips
the private jets and passport, presidential glass floor
gold bottles, gold models, givin' up the ass for
instagram flicks, suckin' dick, fuck is this?
one more sucker wavin' with a flashy wrist
my defense mechanism tell me to get him
quickly because he got it
it's a recession, then why the fuck he at king of diamonds?
no more livin' poor, meet my four-four
when i see 'em, put the per diem on the floor
now kendrick, know they're your co-workers
but it's gon' take a lot 'fore this pistol go cold turkey
now i can watch his watch on the tv and be okay
but see i'm on the clock once that watch landin' in la
remember steal from the rich and givin' it back to the poor?
well, that's me at these awards"
i guess my grandmama was warnin' a boy
she said
