greetings people
you're now rockin' with the best
hub city's threat, minor of the year, k.dot
i know the hood's been waitin', right?
but i'ma stop being stingy
i'ma share with y'all
uh, uh


whoever thought young kendrick would spit so ignorant?
make street disciples go and get a membership
streets revival like creflo dollar hustlin' on the strip
this is church
advise you to purchase it or copy the worst
y'all rhyme sloppy, i rhyme properly
i jam-pack monopoly dollars by puttin' a hundred percent in every verse
add ten percent more, and what do you get
a skinny nigga manipulatin' the innocent
i have no sense, ever since the rodney king riots
mind militant, nigga, don't try it
try to hold the peace, for i promote violence
y'all don't rap, y'all make a lotta noise like sirens
so i'm here to shut shit down
the four pound decorate your city, make over your town
i'm not diddy, but still a bad boy 'til the reaper come get me
follow me now
where no man has stepped, no man has repped
no man can withstand all the nights i've slept
under my sheets, no life, thinkin' 'bout death
fuckin' with me, you just might lose your breath
i'll take you to them pearly gates, them golden streets
plus a cute little casket where your body can sleep
the hub city shit is me, ha


do you believe?
it's kendrick the god
uh
