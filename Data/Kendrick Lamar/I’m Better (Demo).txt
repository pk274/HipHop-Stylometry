come here lil' bitch, i ain't done lil' bitch, one on one lil' bitch, ain't nothin' like me
open your eyes for a second, i'm the high-end legend, i'm the guidance that you need
rollin' on sevens on the regular, now i don't think you ready for the revolution that i bring
one shot, two shot, three shot, four shot
fountain of youth thought- (hol' up, pow-pow)

how many y'all go up (go up)
how many y'all don't holler at her all
but the energy not like us (like us)
half of you niggas just suck (they suck)
how the fuck niggas still ain't grown up
when they thirty-two plus and they live month to month
who would you pick, actin' like they had brunch
nigga i'm disgusted
i ain't gotta say that i'm 'bout to move different
so i can move different
i don't give a fuck if there ten billionaires right here, man, fuck that bitch
if i don't know progress myself 'round you
then i don't know what else to know for you
and i don't know what else controllin' you
ha, ha, ha, ha

made lotta money, but it's not for me
might give it all away like jack dorsey
every gun been strayed and the babies don't need me
buy more land 'cause we never had land
trust me for blood, and my estate plans
i'ma keep it a buck, i'ma five-star brand
killstreaks, 5 links, all plated gold
isolation just to clear my soul
last year, make or break, bad year
the evils was around, but didn't last here
