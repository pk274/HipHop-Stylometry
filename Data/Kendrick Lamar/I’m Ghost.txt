they leave the city behind us
straight out of compton
you need a compass to find us
waters that blue when people called me "your highness"
prince of zamunda, you get in tune with the lions
away from the rumors and those who assume what i am
parked onto hollywood to hawaiian
bitches i’m in the reach of 90 degree climate
it’s me, beautiful sounds at ccyn’s
cheer clk slash g wagon driving
i’m a l-a-m-b-o hoppin' out, cool on auto pilot
smooth ass babies' bottoms with johnson baby powder
hey coward, suck a big dick with aids on the tip
no homo, y'all just make me sick
i’m ready for war
i got my riffle, my sword
blueprint mapped out, this is what’s it all about
but for now cop a sweet out in singapore
piña colada with umbrella straws i’m telling y’all
this is big k nigga
big clip in broad day nigga
big k, wave it your way nigga
