life at the bottom is devastating
you’re hardly ever debated, the party is obligated
by suckers that wanna be you and never live with the matrix
and never ever related to struggle and dedication
your hustle is nominated, anonymous and you faded
the promises that a victory lap is surely awaited
they vomitted everytime that a rapper’s annihilated
just wish them happy belated, fuck you i made it, i’m on
