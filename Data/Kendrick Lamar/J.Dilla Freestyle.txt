i woke up in the morning, washed my body, put some clothes on it
after that, put on my heat like alonzo mourning
cause everybody got a gun, it's like they're copy cats
so me without one is like i'm dated
i'd be out of style like adidas and fat laces
starter jackets and dookie ropes or whatever the late 80's had favored
i'm one of the best of my homo sapiens
one of the best of god's creations
he shows favoritism everytime you hear the record on radio stations
i know you mad, you ain't gotta say much, i can feel you hating
serving mc's like waitress, andre agassi, multitalented
rapper slash athlete, killing these niggas, they're screaming in agony
half of these niggas ain't half of me
half of these niggas ain't talking 'bout nothing, yakity, yakity
pushing my buttons like plaid shirts, clapping them rapidly
actually, kurt, co-bain ten years in my career, pray to god that i don't blow up my brains
lord, i'm here
great depression, i don't know much, all i know is studio sessions, and how to get my bars up
they call me subway sandwich the way i give them cold cuts
cut from a different cloth, and these yves saint laurent jeans;
they cost so much
(?) usher
either way i'm caught up in materialistic
anything that's custom, best believe i'mma get it
getting tired of it and get rid of it, don't step on the compton premises without your weap-on on your hip
the home of the stray bullet that murder the innocent
no matter the crime rate i still remain content
moving at my own pace, cause if it don't make dollars
then it really don't make sense, and if you can't comprehend
i holler like a rottweiler behind a backyard fence
