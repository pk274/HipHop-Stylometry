i don't trust these niggas
i don't trust these bitches
drunk right now, so you know i meant it
8-8-8-808 mafia


if you know me then you know
nigga, chi-town like my second home
i done flew a private jet for some harold's chicken straight from rome
i done bust down on a few thots, fredo hit me on my phone
"nigga, i can't talk right now, gnom-gnom-gnom-gnom
got pussy on my tongue"
i got worry on my brain, i been gone all summer
just to fly back home and found out y'all done killed my little brother
shit is fucked up on these streets
why the fuck would i think about some rap beef?
nigga, i got bigger fish to fry now
empty out my account and i'll pay for sleep (8-8-8-808 mafia)
where's my bottle?
money change and people change
and people come and people go and act estranged
i'm aggravated 'cause they hated
confirmation for success anticipated
i can taste it, i can chase it back down with liquor
i could drown out my sorrows
but i ain't a sorry-ass nigga
get up off your ass, make yourself a hundred racks
bitch, get up off your ass, throw it back back back
back inside my 'bach, back in a garage that we can jack
bitch, i love my hood, i'm strapped up, what's good?
heard someone saidâ€” (8-8-8-808 mafia)
