baby i can't live without you
don't want no bills to pay
star–
star–
starman
oh-oh, yeah (mhm)
fuck all y'all bitches


the sun's reflected off the corners of your mind
i drift in and out of focus as i dream
i drift in and out of focus as i dream
i wish they would stop it at the border
soon as i get a message home i'll send back a friend
i wish i'd had a job and less vacation time
if you couldn't live without me, you couldn't care
i want to stay for the day with joy in my heart
time for a brand new day's ride with some fun
time for a brand new day's ride with some fun
time for a brand new day's ride with some fun
now the red lights are all around my neighborhood
there are no more highlands left burning
