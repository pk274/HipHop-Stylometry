24/7, 365, motherfucker, i'm still right on time
oh, you thought you had me all figured out?
take it from the horse’s mouth, you'll never understand me
i told you my plan b is to win your hearts before we win a grammy
these days, ain't shit changed
different toilet, same shit
and i drank a whole gallon of laxatives by accident just to shit on you has-beens
had it been for my past tense, i wouldn't be rapping
see, these streets made me
broke me down, built me up, drove me crazy
made me hungry, made you hate me, but fuck love
it don't make dollars, it don't make sense, nigga
by the way, that's dj quik, nigga
respect it or check it
these days, i'm a little more focused
‘cause y'all cracked the door and i kicked it open
yellin' “get the fuck down, or i will shoot, i told you not to motherfucking move”
be another example
i'll take the whole industry hostage if i have to
i'll sabotage this game
a good kid? yeah, that's only in my mama's eyes
i seen a dead body at five and that shit made me traumatized
so these days, a little blood on my hands ain't nothing compared to hopping out a minivan
with a mini .223 and the homie tutu, and two more white tees on
oh, nobody got time for that
these days, it's only time for rap
so herbert anthony stevens, you make or break bread before we break even
before they broke our records, we broke records and wrote pieces of history
so these days? these accolades that's meant for we?
it's only truth that this shit was meant to be
tde


i watch that fire that we're gathered around and see that it burns similar to the fire that is inside you
