who i already is
king of my city, gotta get it how i live


me without a dollar is like a scholar with no smarts (whats that?)
that don't make sense don't it? (mm-mmh)
i'm in a lamborghini with a brazilian woman (oh yeah?)
miss novocaine
suck my dick till she numb it (god damn)
you fly like a plane
but i'm more like a comet
soaring over the atmosphere
i can hear the aliens cheer (ha)
victory is sweet my dear (mm-hmm)
here's the technique my dear (mm-hmm)
and maybe you can duplicate me
it's weird how y'all never can progress within the process
of making residuals
i guess that you ain't i yet
try to interfere with the dinero that i get
watch y'all bear arms like women rub on my triceps duddy
y'all is funny to me
you thought i came by myself nope
it's money with me
it's the root of all evil, but the need of all people
yours is frail
i weigh mines on brannon scales
