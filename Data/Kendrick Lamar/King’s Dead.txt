we like fast cars, fast money, fast life, fast broads
egotistic, goin' ballistic, why god?
born warrior, lookin' for euphoria
but i don't see it, i don't feel it, i'm paraplegic
tapped in when i'm maxed in comp-town with the mac-10s
and the pumps in the background i was absent
never og, standout, i was lackin'
everything else, but doubt in the magnum
holdin' magnums with a magnum
nigga, ad-lib and i sing out loud
never had friends, never had ends, never had hope
they was like, "nope," i was like, "bùyào, bùyào"
(yeah, god)
tee off the day, know we off the, be off the, eat off your plate
throw me off, i be, "off ya head"
well ate, on c4, i'm way off the edge
fuck integrity, fuck your pedigree, fuck your feelings, fuck your culture
fuck your moral, fuck your family, fuck your tribe
fuck your land, fuck your children, fuck your wives
who am i? not your father, not your brother
not your reason, not your future
not your comfort, not your reverence, not your glory
not your heaven, not your angel, not your spirit
not your message, not your freedom
not your people, not your neighbor
not your baby, not your equal
not the title y'all want me under
all hail king killmonger
