like the waters in the open sea
when tribulations come all we can say is hopefully
and yesterday you could probably say there's no hope for me
but today i'm overly dedicated, i'm 'posed to be
a testimony for broken hearts in the city
you either crash landing or planning on flying with me
misery loves standing behind its company, well
vividly i can see that your feelings would like to dwell
on our past encounters, reaching over the counter
told me that it's a appealing to pop a pill, that's a downer
i heard emotions burn deep
i heard when you fall out of love the drop is steep
i heard when you see a thug, that's what you try be
got these burdens under my wings, but i'm still free
cause i can make the decision to let it all go away
before i ever run astray i'll look you in the eye and say
