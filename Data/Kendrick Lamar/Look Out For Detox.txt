with the prototype with a godly protocol
you an amateur, they wanna pro to call
i damage ya on camera, in compton, in canada

like a shadow in the dark, you a paddle in the boat
in an ocean full of sharks bout to come up short
water in the pot, flow crack rock like bam bam nigga
have two grams nigga pay up or blam blam nigga
had a black camry, bumpin' dipset, killa cam nigga

although i’m in the land of milk and honey
nobody never gave me shit, when i got my first chain
all the niggas tried to take it from me
i had to fight back and shit
take it back and shit
and you rap niggas looking funny tryna talk back and shit
like he back that shit
acting like you real or something
nigga ain't popped no steel, ain't popped no collar
go pop some pills or something
you trying real hard to appeal to someone
i’m being myself, my bff is a bm-dub
with your bm in it and your stash box glove
and the medicine a doctor gave a nigga won't help
i’m at the limit where i be amazing myself
i bet i finish on a level with a black belt
i bet i hit it where every rapper get killed, like
bla bla bla bla where the knife at?

and if i'm off beat know i’m un-sober
that's a new flow

new dough for the new year and i sumo on a rap peer
not a rapper, i’m a raptor
that's a t-rex in a v-neck for the rapture
i’m a factor and your facial
i will fracture to a fraction
no one-half and i hate math
pastor’s like eddie long, fucking maricon
