too many opinions in the glass house
this world, i don't know no mo' need to cash out


i fall through, nausy
i count the body
stats on black mamba
crown on, bob marley
wrist on yo gotti

ma' don't you call me
too late for sorry
your life like ‘the truman show’
likes on your ig
that don't mean they like you though
i'm careful bout who i know
i ducked the party, who said they saw me?


shout out to my pullout game
too many cups, i don’t pull out the same
(don't pull out thе same)
head so good, couldn’t pull out the lanе
(couldn’t pull out the lane)
both was exotic, that’s a foreign exchange


make it look easy
i need my issue, better believe me
green man!
all in my pocket, talkin' luigi
fuck all the gas
what's up with the play, whats up with the cash?
eyes on you, but if it ain't real, i gotta ask


it's a new year comin' in
and i'ma make a vow tonight (wait)
i won't leave stressed out tonight (wait)
it won't be no let-downs tonight (wait)
ain't no well, wish it loud tonight
let downs tonight
what’s wrong, baby, what’s wrong
oh, you want the password to my phone?
that type of shit gon’ make me leave you alone
that type of shit gon’ make me (mmm)

i usually react to the rumors and the lies
usually, attract all the losers and the vibe
i gotta do what make sense
if i don't try then i don't win
what do i look like livin' for them?
