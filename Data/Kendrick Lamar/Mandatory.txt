oh, damn
jay rock, kill em
no mask on
damn, yeah


crown victoria need a oil change
but i’m still feeling notorious, word to biggie's name
capital k. dot
revolutionary, black stronger than hancock
hand on my cock, fucker
the los angeles pitbull causing the racket
serena williams couldn’t even seen him in tennis practice
fuck with the man-slash-wolf reekening your possession
i stare at the moon and then howl, no question
homie, this is the part where you spaz out
like if a nigga spit in yo' mouth or called your momma a bitch
now that’s some ignorant shit, i’m a ignorant nigga
think of bernie mac & richard taking pictures with ya
with the brain of a million geniuses
fuck you, with a million penises, no homo
fucking faggot, you sucking dick and i'm laughing to the bank, bob saget
give up the chips and make the life with paralysis, chaos, havoc
boycott who ever's the best, including khaled
i pray to god you love your success cause when i have it
you’ll never get a piece, i lay careers out in the streets
if a meteorite had hit me, i be good in a week
if a alligator had bit me, i bet he'd break his teeth
it’s mandatory, it’s mandatory, my dude
you a square beyond squares like a rubik's cube
i would probably kick your ass but my shoes are glued
to the peddle of this vehicular porsche i move
it’s mandatory, it’s mandatory
bear the glory, of a warrior, warriors state out will kill you for me
one man man slaughter tell the world to record me
i don’t care if he’s 7'6, i’ll get to him shortly


hol' up, i got it, ab-soul, let me go sea-floor deep
i’m c4
you a fool if you don’t pick up your heat
then bon soir
bombs away, nigga, bon appétit
i’m rodney king as i endure beat after beat
week after week, like you and him lifting weights in the streets
i do my thing and take a breather, then come again
aiming for your temple like a preacher, as i sin
it's mandatory
