i want it, i want it, i want it-it-it-it


chilly, chilly, chilly, chilly (yeah, what?)
wake up, count chilly (what?)
i'm up, count chilly (up)
tell my mama i hit a lick
tell my mama i hit a lick (lick)
huh, mama, i hit a lick
mama, i hit a lick


chilly, chilly (chilly), chilly (chilly), chilly (count it)
wake up, count chilly
i'm up, count chilly
tell my mama i hit a lick (hit it)
tell my mama i hit a lick
huh, mama, i hit a lick (huh)
mama, i hit a lick


(ahh)
fall off in this bitch, i ball off in this bitch
my commas hit the floor, you crawl off in this bitch
i threw a hundred more, you stall off in this bitch
and then i vámonos, applaud me in this bitch
c-notes, b-notes, p-notes all up in this bitch
man, y'all not in this bitch, y'all are not familiar
y’all are immigrants, the law not in this bitch, i
fuck the opp, no competitor
got into it with my bitch last night
she was right, but i had to get at her
two popped bands and they dance on my waist
hit the face, that’s the editor
i don't take pics on a jet, lil nigga
this shit regular, g5s all in my backyard
sit you roody-poos in the nosebleed
now my pockets holding big protein
big, big protein (protein)
i leveled up past fab five
your favorite rapper desperate housewives
playin’ with me get you chastised
milk 'em all 'til i'm satisfied
they didn’t fall for it, strategize
switch the flow 'cause they know niggas like identity theft
oh, you got like me? (say less)
oh, you pop like me? (say less)
mask keep a nigga (in check)
huh, swag keep a nigga (with checks)
huh, tags on my wall (success)
huh, played the underdog, now flex (now flex)


chilly (chilly), chilly (chilly), chilly (chilly), chilly (chilly)
wake up, count chilly
i'm up, count chilly
tell my mama i hit a lick (lick)
tell my mama i hit a lick
mama, i hit a lick
mama, i hit a lick
