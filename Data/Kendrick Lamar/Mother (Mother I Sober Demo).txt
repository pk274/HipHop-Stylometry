i awoke this morning undecided
my demons taking over my life yeah
sooner or later it's a family divided
these patterns getting hard to hide yeah
they say i should be satisfied
they tell me i have the world, but that's a lie
i wish the way i feel could be pacified


sometimes, i wish i was somebody
anybody but myself
oh i wish i was somebody
anybody but myself


if i told you i'm about to break, would you look at me different?
character out of place, would i lose your attention?
lеt me know your intentions, cause latеly i've been watching everybody
it's apparent that transparency never see monotony
got off a tour looking for closure, mixing emotions of being grateful and feeling like some of y'all getting over
what's a puppet on stage, singing and dancing ablaze but trading his worth?
distorted by the moneys thats made slave with a verse
i feel like prince rodgers, i feel liberation is free, i feel i should miss the oscars
you celebrate me as the artist or just a profit
a question i have for the ones around me that's turning toxic
my lungs been heavy from all the smokes booby traps
reminiscing on what it was knowing that this ain't that
i envision of a rocking in a hard place
i hope my daughter isn't born with the piece of my heart break
you know stress carries on in your kids reap the mistakes you made
and i admit i can be dismissive, if i can't relate
and i admit that my only commit to stop playing games
and i admit that i'm bad at talking myself out of shame
and who's to blame when the crowd stops cheering and they passing dirty looks
i know understand that i'll never be understood, blah!


hmmmmm maayah
isolation didn't work for me (work for me)
socializing didn't work for me even
prayed about it, didn't work for me (work for me)
hmmmmm maayah
you can't cure this disease
the pain too traumatic for relief
pull the curtain let the audience see ya


i wish i was somebody
anybody but myself
oh i wish i was somebody
anybody but myself
