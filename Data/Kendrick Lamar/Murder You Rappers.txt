mind-boggling, word gargling word-ologist
what you hollerin'?
i got enough spit to form my very own island, my friend
wanna take a swim?
step into the booth, you'll probably need a bathing suit
skinny-dipping, my thoughts inside a pool of sharks do
you hesitate to test the waters of a fish tank
you first-timer -- you need more than one-liners
your color scheme is undone, all you have is the primer
paint pictures like art designers --
architect when i often draw the tech
then put your carcass over your set when the words eject
celibacy flow --
really don't matter the sex, just letting you know --
women could get it quicker like chlamydia nigga
disease-infested, please consider --
the piece of her comprehension inside my jurisdiction
and you can't deliver
