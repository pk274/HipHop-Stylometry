one time, i took a swim in the nile
i swam the whole way, i didn't turn around
man, i swear
it made me relax when i came down
i felt liberated like free birds, i'm stimulated now
plunging away 'less my body's on top
all of these currents might cost me my life right now
when danger finds me, it follows with tides
many miles ahead of me, still i'm in stride
she said


told myself if i dive in it without precaution of a lifejacket
then i'll dive in it 'til i am exhausted and i'm type lacking
waistline on four deep, senses on four deep
feel like there's four me


one time, i took a swim in the nile (one time, i took in a swim in the nile; one time)
i swam the whole way, i didn't turn around
man, i swear (i swear, i swear)
it made me relax when i came down (when i came down)
i felt liberated like free birds, i'm stimulated now (stimulated)
plunging away 'less my body's on top (stimulated, stimulated now; on top)
all of these currents might cost me my life right now (right now, right now)
where danger finds me, it follows with tides (follows with tides; stimulated right now)
many miles ahead of me, still i'm in stride
that's some good


i'm in the nile, deep in denial
i'm in the nile, deep in denial
that's some good
