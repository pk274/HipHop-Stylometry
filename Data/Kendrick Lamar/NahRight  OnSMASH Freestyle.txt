soon as the beat drop, i'm on it
when i'm on it the rap, my main purpose is to bone it
i fuck over these tracks like i'm a porno star
a good beat is a fat ass and big titties y'all
i say wassup nah right
i say wassup on smash
like some grapes in a wine cellar
ain't nothing that you can tell her
them top dawg fellas are good fellas indeed
surrounded by palm trees
chronic fingers palm trees
105 hi speed, doing a hundred like my name is big face
shout out to 'tiny' cause i'm tryna escape
the crooked arms of the law
still i shine like the sun facing a star
might brighten up your day tomorrow
mark of the beast on your forehead go head its god given
i'm living like jesus of nazareth whether christian or catholic
sacrifice in my mind, body, and soul for the hip hop
till the shit stop, i'm with pac and big pop, jay rock
tell 'em...
