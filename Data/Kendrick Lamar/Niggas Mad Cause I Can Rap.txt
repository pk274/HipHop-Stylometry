where the rum, jay rock? go head and flex
i be at them niggas necks like a racist cop
just better hope they stay afloat like a boat at the dock
somebody call me a doc, i'm bout to lose it
ironically, i'm smart as alva, but my flow stupid
so stupid that i closed my eyes, wrote a rhyme
by my fourteenth bar, i visioned the three stooges
expression of the shit i write is like "who pooed it?"
i shit on a rapper then make they wifey call me brutus
however we can do this
flow sharper than a machete
and i can stab you in the back like i'm judas
you rap like your raps is the hottest or the coolest
i rap like i'm wrapped in the hands of a god
throw a fire bar then i scream out "hadouken!"
i'm ryu when i ride through, how you?
pyrus and the crips say "how you?"
because i turn a session into a typhoon
and boogie boards couldn't last one second, two
but niggas mad that i can rap
my arsenal make it look all bad for iraq
and you can admire me in the lab for a rack
i need a variety, bitches of cosmetology that could jump on the head
but you can keep all the rats
just model bitches with ass that sit on top of they backs
i'm on top and i'm back for the first time like a new born spinal cord
that's a line, press record


what's goin' on?
why do you refuse to?
feel me, feel me, (feel me)
lord, i need you to
feel me, feel me, (feel me)
