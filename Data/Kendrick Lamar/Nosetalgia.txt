you wanna see a dead body?
instrumentals from my mama's christmas party
trouble's on my mind
i still smell crime, my little brother cryin'
smokers repeatedly buying my sega genesis
either that or my auntie was stealin' it
hit the pipe and start feelin' it
ooh-wee, cut me some slack, weed never did that
this was different, jeez louise, please help me relax
quantum physics could never show you the world i was in
when i was ten, back when nine ounces had got you ten
and nine times out of ten, niggas don't pay attention
and when it's tension in the air, nines come with extensions
my daddy turned a quarter-piece to a four and a half
took an l, started sellin' soap fiends bubble bath
broke his nails misusin' his pinky to treat his nose
shirt buttoned open, taco meat laying on his gold
i said, "daddy, one day, i'ma get you right with thirty-six zips
one thousand grams of cocaine, then your name will be rich
now you can rock it up or sell it soft as leather interior
drop some ice cubes in it, deebo on perimeter"
he said, "son, how come you think you'll be my connect?"
i said, "pops, your ass is washed up, with all due respect"
he said, "well, nigga, then show me how it all makes sense"
go figure, motherfucker, every verse is a brick
your son dope, nigga
now reap what you sowed, nigga (please reap what you sowed, nigga)
i was born in '87, my granddaddy a legend
now the same shit that y'all was smokin' is my profession, let's get it
