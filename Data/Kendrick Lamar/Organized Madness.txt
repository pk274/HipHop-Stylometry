now i'm no stranger to danger
it ain't too much that i'm afraid of
but the land of the lawless
the only song they sang was


organized madness, organized madness
organized madness


the wind blow different on this side
whisper something slang
dreams get deferred by nightmares, sleep when you can
and the streets, oh, the streets look like crayons, black and rеd
heroin lips, cornrows, and bald heads, gangsta
it ain't wherе you from, it's where you at
so when i look around, hoping i see jesus
but this the devil's playground
on the monkey bar for the evening (evening, evening, evening)


organized madness, organized madness
organized madness (need you, need you, you, oh)
organized madness, organized madness
organized madness


barefoot babies with no care
teenage gun toters that don’t play fair, should i get out the car?
they say curiosity killed the cat, and if this tourist don't go home
they might kill more than that, oh (oh, i need you to see)
bird call, hoping that our lungs react
as i look around, i see dirt roads
i see hubcaps and outside toilet bowls
i see prostitution, i see kids looting
i see havoc and stress, i see retribution
i see refugee, i see low equity
i see transport, export with accessory
i don’t see compton, i see something much worse
the land of the landmines, the hell that’s on earth


organized madness
organized madness
organized madness (need you, need you, you, oh)
organized madness
organized madness
organized madness
