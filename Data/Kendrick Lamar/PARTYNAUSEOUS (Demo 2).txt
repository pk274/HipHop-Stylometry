i say brace yourself, wanna see you take yourself to a place you've never been?
face yourself in the mirror, stand in a room with all your enemies near
look in forward the eye and tie your white flag, hold it high
then buy a 
hate to love your rival, you hate to love your rival
so just make this your survival, take your time and become item
let the music make you want it, shun the ones that will deny you
from the truth' that has begun, now pass the tomb that closes by you
