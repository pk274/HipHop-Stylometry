let’s talk about the street fightin'
we liked it and never lost it
that's gun riots, drive by it with no stalkin'
that shit talkin', pissed off cause we piss poor
mob pulls bleed see years of war
what you livin for? a couple stolen cars
white t’s, jordan 4's, ratchet hoodrat broads
a human stash box before they start that martial law
fuck planet earth, we killed that turf, they want mars
pussy, was fat as mother love
giving birth to precious, hell yea i wanna fuck
she took my pacifier and tried to throw up them digits
opened up my mouth to say she replaced them with sherm stick uh uh
she said you must be wet behind the ears, uh huh
i said i'm blessed my mama wasn’t here
then we started vibin' and writin' melodies to the sirens
gun smoke in the air, we stared at the horizon
hypnotizin', and murder was the case
and every time she wake up, she’s at another wake
her name is compton and she need a place to stay
and said if she can live in my heart, she'd play my soul safe
amen
