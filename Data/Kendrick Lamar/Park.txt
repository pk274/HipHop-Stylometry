park him on the spot, park him if he say he hot
park him while his friends watch
i am everything you not
they say shame on me, i got the underground on lock
that's what hoes say, that's what the bros say
i tell a freak bitch, "baby, let's roleplay"
i like the kinks bitch, fuck me 'til the ojs
i mean my chain a woo-sah, i mean my game a woo-sah
i want some head in my new car, bitch, i don't care who drive by
you know i could make you famous
you know life bring changes
shit, i changed locations soon as that big bag came in
that's a mighty fine ass you got
thought i forgot?
i can make the play and cash it out
thought i forgot? whoa
