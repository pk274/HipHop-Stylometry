kung fu kenny, look look
who the fuck you talkin' to? you mainey (you mainey)
salute me when i'm walkin' through, you ain't me (you ain't me)
everything i do is with the extras (extras)
flip me couple million for investments
and my hood love me unconditional
your hood love you 'cause you on the instrumental though
this rap shit crazy, need the woosah
they screamin' compton, must be two sides
r.i.p. to shawty lo, yeah b. dot know i'm flexin'
vip my barrio, 200 on the guest list
i don't like to sugarcoat or politic with yes men
i like me a boujee hoe from normandie and western
2017 onto bigger things (bigger things)
i got a smaller team, got a bigger ring (bigger ring)
everybody a crip 'til they black and blue
everybody a blood 'til they hemorrhaging
ah man, mike will made-it
two back to back spurs, me and mike will made it
double park on the curb, i can drive but i'm lazy
half a pint, whole pint, gassed up, crazy, ayy
