in due time i'm the modern day albert einstein
i'm prime time like deion
and the rest of y'all is peons
i pee on the best
whoever you are you can step
like a prosthetic leg
i see monsters in my head
that's why i rap with such aggression
i tear down studio sessions
rappers scared, they walk in the booth
with a bible and a reverend
i use my mouth as a weapon
bullets rip through your mid section
rat tat a tat tat tat rata tat tat tat
i'm a comptown, nigga get a casket
go against me, that'll lead to my advantage
because i've got to eat
and for real i'm feeling kind of famished
hotter than the earth core, don't show me where no fan is
show me where your fans is so they can see the real
i'm sick and electrifying, that's double ill
me feel like me will be a legend like will was a legend
but i'm not an actor, put that in my will
gimme a second uncut coke lyrics what i'm stressing
she want the raw so i fed her lines like kevin
tell 'em i'm a werewolf, behold the 5 6 bigfoot
lear jet overlook the country like garth brooks
lyrics on point, plus i got the right hooks
like tommy hearns, punchlines burn
i'm not concerned about the soundscan
cause most of y'all is drowning
a lifeguard that's lounging
meaning i don't worry about none of you rappers
i'm way more live
that's evil backwards
now with that great word play
i tend to let my words play
like children on a saturday
it's sad to say you're not up to par
and i don't play with mini golf and sharks
jump inside the pool of sharks, we're biting off your head, your heart, your legs, arms
bled like jay rock or big wy
and make sure you wear a vest
because they my family ties
suit up
you got a three piece? i got a three piece
a mac-11, a 9 mili, and a de
he backpedaling like a db
i'm such a martian
call me et
always behind it like i own the tp
i shit, fart, pee pee on anybody track
walk in the booth and drink down a fifth of ex-lax
wassup
now phone home
my nigga punchline is on, wipe 'em down
