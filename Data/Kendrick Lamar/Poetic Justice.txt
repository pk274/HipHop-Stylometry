every second, every minute, man, i swear that she can get it
say, if you a bad bitch, put your hands up high
hands up high, hands up high
tell 'em dim the lights down right now, put me in the mood
i'm talkin' 'bout dark room, perfume
go, go


i recognize your fragrance, hol' up, you ain't never gotta say shit, uh
and i know your taste is a little bit, mmm, high maintenance, uh
everybody else basic, you live life on an everyday basis
with poetic justice, poetic justice
if i told you that a flower bloomed in a dark room, would you trust it?
i mean, i write poems in these songs dedicated to you when
you're in the mood for empathy, there's blood in my pen
better yet, where your friends and 'em? i really wanna know you all
i really wanna show you off, fuck that, pour up plenty
of champagne, cold nights when you curse this name
you called up your girlfriends and y'all curled in that little bitty range, i heard that
she wanna go and party, she wanna go and party
nigga, don't approach her with that atari, nigga, that ain't good game, homie, sorry
they say conversation rule a nation, i can tell
but i could never right my wrongs 'less i write it down for real, ps


anytime
you can get it, you can get it, you can get it, you can get it
and i know just, know just, know just, know just, know just what you want
poetic justice, put it in a song, alright
anytime
you can get it, you can get it, you can get it, you can get it
and i know just, know just, know just, know just, know just what you want
poetic justice, put it in a song, alright


anytime
you can get it, you can get it, you can get it, you can get it
and i know just, know just, know just, know just, know just what you want
poetic justice, put it in a song, alright
anytime
you can get it, you can get it, you can get it, you can get it
and i know just, know just, know just, know just, know just what you want
poetic justice, put it in a song, alright


every time i write these words they become a taboo
makin' sure my punctuation curve, every letter here's true
livin' my life in the margin and that metaphor was proof, i'm talkin'
poetic justice, poetic justice
if i told you that a flower bloomed in a dark room, would you trust it?
i mean, you need to hear this, love is not just a verb
it's you lookin' in the mirror, love is not just a verb
it's you lookin' for it, maybe, call me crazy, we can both be insane
a fatal attraction is common, and what we have common is pain
i mean, you need to hear this, love is not just a verb
and i can see power steerin', sex drive when you swerve
i want that interference, it's coherent, i can hear it, mhmm
that's your heartbeat, it either caught me or it called me, mhmm
read slow and you'll find gold mines in these lines
sincerely, yours truly, and right before you go blind, ps


anytime
you can get it, you can get it, you can get it, you can get it
and i know just, know just, know just, know just, know just what you want
poetic justice, put it in a song
