look inside the eyes of the last mohicans survived
you won't last a weekend outside
seen a pastor tweaking, then sunk his teeth in a rock his demise
later on that evening you heard the grieving of angels that cried
see a demon don't compromise
and so i walk alone with a cross and a diamond stone
i'm a diamond inside the rough that's too mighty for maricons
i might as well put all my killers in ysl
put my voice on this microphone, put you pussy niggas through hell
hell's fire, i never lie, you will never grind
i know the priors they running by us when we do crime
i know that section eight wanna discontinue my moms
when they heard that ohio state gave me 30 racks in july
oh lord, this can't be life, no it can't be life
when they day breaks and you earned them stripes
and you learned that strike
from upstate will adjourn that life and confirm that life
it's good bait for the warden that might get awarded and write
now your fate can record it denied a reporter replied
the death rate will eventually climb, so eventually i'm
on a track race for the dough before time get a clock that resigns
so about face if it ain't business, i get offended, i mind
now one fake, i'm a realist in strive, i'm a billion in five
well a billion cause the limit is the sky and i live on cloud nine
and i recognize my nemesis gon' try to put a finish in my shine
but pussy, we'll hurt you
life in the power circle
