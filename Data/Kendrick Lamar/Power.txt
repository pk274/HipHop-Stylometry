let’s talk about power
let's talk about yours and ours that paid the allowance
let's talk about hundred-thousand kids ravin’ and bouncin
cravin' and drownin in words the day i pronounce it
let's talk about power
let's talk about do'ers and dont'ers
the house i built when i was homeless and sleepin' in corners
sharin’ coronas and black & milds
donuts in el caminos
talkin’ loud, scrapin' and combin'
residue every mornin'
talk about legacy
let's talk about the life of celebrity
verses integrity
curse the first one that thirst for necessity
searching for equity
verses the earth that birthed us indefinitely
verse the verse i wrote in jeopardy
surfin' the laws of the universe and destiny
church and a god is all that’s ever been ‘head of me, aw
let's talk about my power, the golden child was
granted to be on your cameras and store counters
he’s bananas, competitive, we can dance
see the damage, no more fo’ he peed his pants
my second lp had real niggas on potus lawn
my seven trophies is at my granny's and heaven arms
i'm in jamaica like “wah gwaan,” my feet  is out
my hair is long and patois comin' from my mouth
me, i go outdoors it's time to bless up erryuhn'
rude boy, me, i ain't worry 'bout it, fearless
i shot niggas, then shot movies ten years later
dear god, why you show me so much favor?
amongst the haters and wickedness (wickedness)
deliver this child from evil convictions and frivolous (frivolous)
debates about who's the preeminent  emcee of the millennium
and it's all for the benjamins
and i'm all of y'all nemesis
and i'm all in all happy none of y'all can fathom who kendrick is
the only one that ever did wrote the book of genesis
motherfucker, that's power
