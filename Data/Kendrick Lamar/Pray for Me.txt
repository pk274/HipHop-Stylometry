i fight the world, i fight you, i fight myself
i fight god, just tell me how many burdens left
i fight pain and hurricanes, today, i wept
i'm tryna fight back tears, flood on my doorsteps
life a livin' hell, puddles of blood in the streets
shooters on top of the building, government aid ain't relief
earthquake, the body dropped, the ground breaks
the poor run with smoke lungs and scarface
who need a hero? (hero)
you need a hero, look in the mirror, there go your hero
who on the front lines at ground zero? (hero)
my heart don't skip a beat, even when hard times bumps the needle
mass destruction and mass corruption, the souls of sufferin' men
clutchin' on deaf ears again, rapture is comin'
it's all prophecy and if i gotta be
sacrificed for the greater good, then that's what it gotta be


just in case my faith go, i'll live by my own law
i'll live by my own law, i'll live by my own
just in case my faith go, i'll live by my own law
i'll live by my own law, i'll live by my own
