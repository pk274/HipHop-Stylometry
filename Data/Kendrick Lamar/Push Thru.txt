like kindergarteners
my vision’s bothered by vigilantes that harbor on street corners
try your hardest to harvest bundles of weed on ya
the starving’ll speed on ya, stampede on ya
impede on your pockets then pee on ya
dreams of us living lavish in fabrics of fine linens
spending, established, with women dining and laughing
but this environment got us violent, ready to crash in–
–to society, take this driver seat, hope you fastened
your seatbelts twice, when i rolled them dice, i crapped
so many times i can build casinos from scratch
too many daps you might receive from the things you achieve, relax
that’s what my mental say, but my physical’s been detached
i’m on some other shit, like fuck the government
i'm higher rankings, where’s the mothership?
i made a covenant that i was changing but my luck has been
quite disgusting when reality tainted, where the fuck you been?
left him face down like he was planking
in a cold world where old girl and her homeboy got a motive
you can bench curl your tribulations, that sensation's insulting
got a wifey or a mistress, nigga which one you indulging?
regardless of who you pick know life's a bitch when you ain't focused nigga
i'm focused
