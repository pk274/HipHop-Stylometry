kendrick lamar, i'm bout to get my mop stick
niggas bump their gums, and their bitches be bumping my shit
i fry your optics, if you watching my style, watch it
tyrannosaurus reading thesaurus, hold rappers hostage
catastrophic, it's 9-11 when i'm repping
skip college to fly first class, learn a lesson
straight brutal, roman numerals
number one eating ramen noodles, rhyming crucial under the sun
kudos to the most high, which is me
i probably make 'em plan their suicide, so usually
i ain't never been with the shit starting, but y'all done started some shit
i'm 'bout to drink some ex-lax then commence
to returning the favor to all of my neighbors and comrades
calm down, you more like trina than trinidad, let's box now
throw your dukes up
pussy probably holding daisy dukes and c-cups
i look inside this industry and i don't see much
i just see lunch, and your shit that's more bore like tourists
i'm laid back, my feet up, how cool is that?
the twenty-ten kool g. rap, whenever i rap
i got my arsenal strapped on my back, i'm ready for war
they tend to look for me when they fiend for afeni shakur
conversing, not hibernating, under the planet core
at thirteen i cancelled pg-13 and went for gore
that's what i pledge
it's profound that i'm underground touching 'mainstreams' like river beds
