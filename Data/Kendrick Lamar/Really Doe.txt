life is like an appetite of truth and dare, i double dare ya
life to end in vain before the end is near
see i can hear you crying
silence sittin' in the dark
holdin' crosses 'cross your heart
sin is such a work of art
watch out for the love lost

bet a thousand, shoot a thousand
things a nigga do for thousands
made a million counting sheep
gave it all to public housin'
taking off to abu dhabi
beamin' up the motor, scotty
talking to promoters, scotty
everybody know it's gotti
murder one, you've heard of them
the rev undid, the all day madness
got it off the wipe it off, the evidence, the blood on mattress
big power, big stages
my zoo cannot fit the cages
this booth is not used to fakin'
my crew just love confrontation
i chewed the face off the laces
i moved the weight from the waitress
i chef the pot that made poison
i cooked then kicked all the patients
my bitch is way beyond basic
that's life insurance, car insurance, good pussy insurance
ayy, look what we're enduring
ayy, ridin' in foreigns
ayy, k-dot, four years, i got the same watch
but it's the real watch and that bitch fire
speed racer waitin' outside
the roof on it like a tank top
countin' money, watchin' paint dry
when i'm done is when the rain stops, uh


they say i got the city on fire
i ain't boomin', that's a goddamn lie, woah
really doe, like really doe
really doe, like really doe
they say i got the city on fire
i ain't boomin', that's a goddamn lie, woah
really doe, like really doe
really doe, like really doe
