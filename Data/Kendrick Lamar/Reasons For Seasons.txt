little kendrick from the hood
i'll show you that my motto always been to give you love
i'm putting out good music in return to build a buzz
that's bigger than life itself or some bubble kush plug
won't you look at the mirror
you see a pair of eyes that's quite similar to mine
and if you do, that shit should scare ya
baby brother of compton, tryna accomplish
the impossible, with obstacles at my daily grindin'
oh no, here come the critics but not from the magazines, i mean
the blocks that were so called mad at me, they're mean
'cause soon as success is in my favor
they'll try to break down my character like i ain't from
