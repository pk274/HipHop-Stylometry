recognize my life
ridicule my fight
give me fuel for the fire burning when i yearn these lights
in the midst of the hieroglyphs my fingertips start to write
get familiar with cartwright
cause i want that shot, i'm a raging bull when the needle drops
for the record, i'mma wreck it, even if my record don't pop
i'mma tie a knot on a downtown building, let it tow behind me tell 'em
they can find me in the dark with the ghetto children look at my heart
nigga fuck your feelings, this is me
