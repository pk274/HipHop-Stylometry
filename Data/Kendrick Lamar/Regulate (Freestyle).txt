yeah...
hit the east side of the lbc
on a mission trynna find mr. warren g
when i jumped off the porch, i was forced into last resort
of a typical short end, of course where that took us course
hoarse for yelling out demons that fought inside of me, talk society how to rejoice
killers aside of me, privacy obviously was lost
fraud, piracy of the streets of my odyssey
caught a bullet that probably destroyed
a good kid in a mad city slightly annoyed
i walk out the street with no heat and wanted to beef when i"m just a vegan
reeking the scent of a saint, sinner smelling the stars squeezing
pillars stumbling straight to my melon apparent reason
probably because i'm a cousin, cousin of blood that blooded in public
and kendrick seen with him last weekend, cousin
but you ain't' no friend of me, instead of kendrick i'm kennedy
assassinate my character, sure, if that's your remedy
fair enough, i got enemies, but guess who bang?
but that's the repercussion like when your cousin is cussing a blood and your by yourself at the compton parade
good kid, mad city, life or death, is you with me?
