let's talk about the things that i hate
i hate the trendiness, i hate the gossip, can't relate
i hate opinions when the subject got no real estate
i hate the men and woman, into saving face
i hate the wait, i hate to play it safe
i'm an engineer, i hate, you got no taste
you hate, i persevere
i hear your truth, i hear your lie
what i hate the most? oh, when somebody die
when somebody die (die), you will say you in your feelings
when somebody die (die), you will say that was your nigga
when somebody die (die), you gon' ask for forgiveness
when somebody die (die), you gon' use it for attention
when somebody die (die), everybody fake woke
when somebody die, coping mechanisms is a joke
when somebody die, how many want to be a part of it?
fuck the condolences, it's all about the art of it
