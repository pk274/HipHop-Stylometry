kendrick lamar, young nigga
before i ever wear a chain, i make sure you know my name
i'm the same good kid from the block where you was raised
didn't have a pot to piss in peeing in your pj's
you see my story is a story untold by the kid from compton making straight a's for new clothes
surrounded by bullets from one of my relatives foes
because he been a killer since he was 12 years old
the price of being guilty by association got me places i ain't ever been
like in back of the swap meet niggas trynna test my chin
squaring up like a nerd before summer school begin
then break when bullets breaks wind
all i wanna do is rap
but it's a wrap
when you living inside of iraq and
george bush in the culdesac
you get pushed and you righteous act
it's a murder charge on your back
can i captivate this captive before you try peel my cap
can i live
huh
kendrick lamar
