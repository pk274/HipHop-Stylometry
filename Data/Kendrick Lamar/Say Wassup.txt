i'm ghetto, my kool-aid need mo' sugar
five-star suite, you ain't know, suga? (you ain't know, bitch?)
i’m chilling, bumping anita baker
caked up, they wonder why i don’t need a baker
but really though, i just need a hater
so i ask 'em for their number when i see a hater
ask obama if i don’t know about presidents
keep them deadmotherfuckers resting in my money clip
