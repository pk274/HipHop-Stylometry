have you ever been punched in your motherfuckin' face?
what you sayin'? oh you haven't? alright, wait, bitch (yeah)


i want the fade (i want the fade)
give me my fade, i want the fade
i need the fade (i need myâ€”)
we gotta fade, give me my fade (fade)
we gotta fade (fade)
give me my fade, i want the fade (i)
i need the fade (fade)
run me my fade (fade)


i can't please everybody, not even me
i wanna please god, but my issues too deep (bless up!)
gotta change my number every week
in a meango, i got 'em hot, i got 'em grease
shut the fuck up, can't you see my daughter sleep?
shut the fuck up


servin' up a look, dancin' in a drought
hello to the rain man, never losing count
ventin' in the safe house
ventin' in the safe house

can i vent all my truth? i got nothin' to lose, i got problems and pools, i can swim on my faith
cameras movin' whenever i'm movin', the family suin' whatever i make
murder is stackin', the president actin', the government taxin' my funds in the bank
homies attracting the feds when i'm bracking, look at my reaction, my pupils on skates (woah, woah)

everything jaded (jaded)
team on go, let's get it (get it)
green gon' grow like veggie (veggie)
casino on my debit (debit)


fuck your rhetoric, fuck your leverage
chains, no evidence, pass gold, motherfuck' confederate
flags on the back of the medicine
distriuted in ghettos and-
fuck your heritage, fuck your brainwash
detergent, internet urgent
time travels in purges, every man and virgin
fuck chatterin' sermons
fuck your church propaganda, only god knows the answer
we oblige in the cope of state of mechanic camouflage
like a sheep, always slide through a cancer, lies and deceit
vibe like a phantom, dodging' police and paramedic retreats
when i fuck y'all up for tellin' me "your life was the one i want"
been sellin' me concepts ever since i swung
from under the pro tongue, dedicated myself for recreation
i rest my case, won


servin' up a look, dancing' in a drought
hello to the rain man, never losing count
ventin' in the safe house
ventin' in the safe house
servin' up a look, dancing' in a drought
hello to the rain man, never losing count
ventin' in the safe house
