uh, hannibal lector pressure inside my veins
you nothing but a tangible wrestler
stressed to entertain, i intertwine
with rhymes, while circling candles in the rain
cause a seance, call my great aunt
and tell her i'm insane
i love the night life, dracula, e-parasite, where my fangs
knowing my vice, advice-giving by killers who obtain
bullets and dice, gamble with it
put dentures on your name
price on your head
sell it for cheap, like an ebay domain
blucker, ey fucker ! my pedigree might fuck ya
no homo, take yo logo, and yo promo to an usher
to walk it down them church pews
i killed it had a curfew
a 6 p.m, a black p.m
that's all they seen, i tucked a murder weapon in my brain
my nigga, you know the drama i bring
clinically saddam hussein
while fucking on the dom hossain
thas a famous bitch
now tell me who you hangin' with
its a privaledge
to fuck with kendrick and kevin durant on some gangsta shit


shitted on em
man
and i take my time, to write these lines
only aliens can see the signs
jupiter's intruder, i'm, looking for another universe to climb
