c4, k.dot, let's get it (dj dave)
yeah, punch wanted me to come right in on the one
i didn't want to (dj ill will)
i love this beat
i love it so much, i can just listen to the instrumental
and don't rap
but i won't do that


light an incense for little kendrick, little, oh, kendrick
determination, my drive is like a thousand convertible engines
my adrenaline pump the blood of a warrior, chump, the apprentice
grown to be a man, 21 now, my heart in my hand
don’t get gunned down, i’m from compton, bitch
fuck a 6-4, we hit the kill switch
the other day i seen my nigga snows in the casket
darker skin tone, you can only imagine
the type of shit we on, murdered them dumb bastards
kill 'em inside their kitchen
and then stuffed them inside their cabinets
death before dishonor, put that on my mama
i'mma ride till i see the promise land, that’s a promise
llamas in the unfamiliar minivan
more drama only make more problems, but


they gotta get shot down
'cause we riding, we riding, we riding
they gotta get shot down
'cause we riding, we riding


like a black rodeo, .44’s, calicos
chop 'em up, stop 'em up like a stuffy nose
we supposed to be brothers, motherfuck ya
tuck your tail, bitch, hell is waiting on ya
while i’m praying on ya
not on my knees though, i mean preying on ya
i gotta feed, ho, and your death is nutritious to my appetite
after i eat, you’re sure to see afterlife
jesus christ, forgive me for my sins
because when you forgive me, i’m sure to sin again
i guess i’m a sinner, especially when i found out somebody killed my nigga
nigga, does anybody killer, fuck your creed, race, or color
son, daughter, sister, mother, brother gotta suffer
bitch, i’m cold hearted, till my arteries freeze
please hand me the keys to the g-ride
they outside then


they gotta get shot down
'cause we riding, we riding, we riding
they gotta get shot down
'cause we riding, we riding


somebody get ready for a murder
no more further announcements
mac-11 bouncing, the murder scene, coroner, yellow tape surrounding
either i retaliate or find self counseling
somebody got to die, simple mathematics
semi-automatic, watch them niggas panic and their hearts perish
or let's be diplomatic and less melodramatic
everything is vanity, think ecclesiastic
but what’s it all for, or what’s it all mean?
an eye for an eye means you and i won’t live to see
as our hearts bleed, we proceed cautiously
shoot them niggas down consciously, that’s how


they gotta get shot down
'cause we riding, we riding, we riding
they gotta get shot down
'cause we riding, we riding
