fuck, watch how i kill 'em with the funky rhythm
i'll bomb if you don't feel 'em, piranhas in 'em
feed my persona as i get deep as nostradamus
no stallin' like the 
drunk off paul, nigga, pourin' by the rover, bitches
pourin' hollows over haters, we killin' insecure niggas
feelin' like the old jigga, old nas, old big, new 'pac
oh my god, he's alive, he dropped bombs on you intellects
bombin' everythin' from the streets to the internet
hear the instrumental wet
then i'm a bust a nut, yep, i'm a fuckin' nut
that is not an escalade, that's a damn armored truck
shoot who? shot what?
you ain't popped shit but some bubblegum and a bump
who you motherfuckers want?
leave a motherfucker slumped from the fuckin' pump
he's a peanut to an elephant, put that nigga in a trunk
might be out in houston, lean in my pimp cup
ride in '84s, throwed like a shot put
hoes on my jock like i'm from the atl
in our new block, choppers on the rooftop
flip a nigga like he was a nba mascot
strip a nigga from his wade cap to his two socks
got it from them compton blocks
raised from my grandpa's
every day, caught a fade like we like we own the barber shop
goons in the parkin' lot
who are you to fool if you bark a lot with no bite like an iguana
get killed right in front of your momma
hold tight, coroner comin'
summertime, perfect time for dove huntin'
and you a woman want to be at my house with her ass out
she climaxed and passed out
and promotional flyers, k-dot be the flyest
eat ten rappers a day, that's a hell of a diet
straight up like a kangaroo
pumpin' like a fist do from a pro-black
this is automatic rap, made a minute, take a second
i'm a get it maybe here for a minute when i'm finished
let's begin it
