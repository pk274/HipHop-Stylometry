look inside my eyes, you can see the universe fly
deep inside my pupils the aliens camouflaged
another way to shoot you, my mind is of mass destruction
i'll drop a gallon of henny in the big dipper then dive
bitches skinny dipping in my orbit
ever seen a martian? gorgeous or some u.f.o. porsches
i live inside the air plus i wear air jordans
so the mic is always near me whether swaggin' or recordin'
journey on my voyage, you know the sky is the limit
but it's ironic that method never applied to kendrick
i catapult over your telescope and when i'm finished
i grab the fire that's burning from mars to light an incense
this rapping's just a metaphor and i deserve a medal for
writing another metaphor, about ambition
i envision me taking off astronautin' myself
fuck the world, i'll beat that bitch with the orion's belt
