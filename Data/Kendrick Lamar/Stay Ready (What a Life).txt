tell me find your spot with the warning that i might slip
and when you climb on top that's the ultimate road trip
ride on me like your pac got me thinkin' it's 96'
i can rap on some nineties shit, wrap your leggings around my hip
i'm so hip to it, tourists want to come speculate
but if i stay monogamous promise this kiss will always taste like candy
and, yeah, it's obvious momma now probably can't stand me
i'm sure they're tired of this look that you have when you're antsy
we gon' fuck around (mmm), we gon' fuck around
and triple through triplets of babies right now
and that might break the record and no, that don't mean you're fertile
that means we're fucking reckless, plus we don't use protection
i find myself reading old text messages when i'm bored
we find ourselves sexting 'til that connection is restored
i know that sounds immature, but if we never grow up
then i wish you good luck on the seats thats inside this porsche


come to me, come, come to me
look at what you've done to me
you put a gun to me
then you brought the sun to me

shine like blood diamonds
learning to have patience only cause you are timeless
the universe energy doesn't lie
and this chemistry is infinity at a million times
i wrote a million rhymes describing your star power
and after 24 bars, you get 24 hours
