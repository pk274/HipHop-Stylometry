gangster
just watch, uh-huh


take a trip with a narcoleptic
suffered insomnia, but this time it was only seconds
i see thermometers boil as you lay in the desert
of eternal fire, hate ya denied yourself of a blessin'
meanwhile i'm on a new cloud chunkin' the deuce, uh
renewed vows with sinners, homies, enemies too, uh
gold towel under my feet clickin' the fluke
with a thousand troops, crip and piru, nigga, woop, woop, uh (ayy, ayy, what's happening with it, gangster?)
love, i depend on, white doves, i depend on (b.k., what's happening, fool?)
they fly through this end zone that meant known to vent on
so listen, homie (homie), you miss me with that bullshit
i keep my distance, homie (homie), i am on a higher pulpit
you cannot visit, homie (homie), i mean the beauty of heaven
is far for me not to exit, it's like an anti-depressant
you see the vision, homie (homie)? i mean this godly advice
fuckin' right, even if you pinch me twice, yes, i
keep dreamin'
