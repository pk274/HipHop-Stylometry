if you look inside my mind you'll probably see atomic bombs
loaded with explosive grenades holding dope rhymes
and it's potent
you never heard a heroic flow more divine
as a poet i know i'm the don
like sunrise and i owe it to family genes
the albert einstein in the pocket of dungarees
and i'm dunking on shaq with ease
it's a lay up every time i stay up
i'm in the studio the time they wake up, but wake up
it gets worse
there's not a weapon that can prosper
the prognosis of a sick rapper that can rock ya whole roster
this is genius,
