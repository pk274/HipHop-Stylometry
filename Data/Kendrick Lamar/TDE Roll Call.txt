west coast tsunami, come jump inside of the wave pool
fresh out the county with beepers over their ankles
bitches and bugs, their earlobes flooded with bengals
.38 slug, passenger seat, let it bang you
i was born the same year you was rocking a kangol
twenty years later, my style favor a kangaroo
jumping off the ground i’m tapping the star spangle
banner with manners over ignorant lost angels
cameras flash, nappy hippy from every angle
hammers will blast, snap and hit you from every angle
like a porno, no homo, you wear rainbow
i'm with a bad chick that suck on my mandingo
you’re making up publicity stunts to make your name blow
i’m dropping c4 every month to make my name blow
drive a hoopty every month like its a range rove
get in on the passenger side because the door broke
take you on a natural high, this is for sure dope
watch you od outside, then give you more dope
i’m gon’ flood the streets outside, go buy a raincoat
open the door, my tapes fall out your durango
west coast ‘till i’m gone and wearing the halo
‘til then i'm ready for war, let’s play halo
take down a fifth of hennessy and watch the day go
bye like farewell, can somebody just pray for
me like holiest priest on god’s payroll
tabernacle to all the church's chickens i ate on
it’s k.dot you motherfuckers, motherfucker, mother, blucka blucka, bring a ruckus
better duck 'em, make you suffer quick, suck a dick


my niggas, we all gotcha
my niggas is all shottas
and niggas ain't nothing but bitches, they all gossip
my words come hard as a bishop in tranquilize ya
and murder goes hand and hand like sanitizers, i been a problem, shootout to problem
