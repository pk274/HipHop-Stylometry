my woman be trippin sometimes
i remember her strippin off martin and sipping on some of the cheapest of wine
which way we gone climb? i'm tryna get higher but you desire land mines, blow up
every time i'm, in clubs tryna network my social
life like i'm supposed to but i'm wrong
to you i'm very wrong, but you don't get it, and you won't admit it you say i'm like your ex but i think were nothing different
she gave me them digits
but i didn't call, i put that on me
and yo girlfriends, i know they throw salt like angelina jolie, now let's see
i'll be gone til wednesday, gotta show in portland
now my baby, say i ain't her baby
but more of an abortion i'm like that's crazy
i bought that lexo, and sat it on jordans
now miss lady, if promoters don't pay me
then we can't afford it
forging signatures on fake check
it ain't life if i don't break sweat
to break these mics on every set
it's ironic i'm tryna stay grounded at the same time still fly these jets
hello, goodbye marro rodeo
it's funny you had a great, but still you took ungrateful

chorus
