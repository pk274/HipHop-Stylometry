uh, iming out the cannon of bazookas
100 ways to fuck you over, no karma sutra
west coast till my death bed, cutting up
somebody fuck with mr. edward scissorhands
been the man before you've been the man
and i've been the man's equilibrium until it worrisome
aiming for his gut like caesarians
throw me in aquariums, bet i'll grab a shark
snatch out his heart, freeze it, then preserve it in a jar
i'm all these niggas bumping like stickers at the end of a car
aka k dot commit a sin, press record
i kill 'em every time, this ain't a free verse
this a crime, grab a hearse, or duck the bomb
big ass w, and i throw it up like powder in the hands of lebron, nigga what?
compton on my raider cap, oh wait, no wait
but we want our spot back, bout to go nuts
somebody hand me a jockstrap, i ball everywhere
pure beast, a bear couldn't even bear
royal flush, like the feds rolling up
and i fuck with bad lucc, but never broke a mirror
yeah, it's like that for you other coasts
i'm right back in the '87 regal, and the people watch
my wheels peel, like another motrin
i'm a headache for pete's sake, you cheapskates
can never out do me, or better yet do us
water's run deep, and you fucking around with scuba
divers with riders sticking their hand inside the cooler
i live in a iceberg, you telling me you cooler?
i'm living my dreams and i can't kill a freddy kruger
bout to run the game in some ran down pumas
and my name mr. k almighty, you try to low ball
but she speaks only highly, try me, q
