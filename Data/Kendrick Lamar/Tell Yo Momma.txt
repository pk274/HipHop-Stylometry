oh, i'ma tell your momma on you
the way make it move like a stripper do
oh, i'ma tell your daddy on you
how easy it is to get next to you
meanwhile, i'ma let you get wild in here
meanwhile, i'ma let you get it hot in here
meanwhile, i'ma let you do your thing in here
meanwhile, i can keep a little secret, can you?


it's k-d-izzle
t-u-nizzle
how i get down, make moves upon the ground
stand on the block with the k not the pistol
fuck with jay rock everyday it's official
seen shorty run away, not invisible
fuck your mental a nigga love your physical
it's that simple i'll show you what a pimp can do
put you on corners and have niggas renting you
like real estate, see a bitch, fuck her face
k.dot never hate, only dig, penetrate
what you know about that thing cupping your waist
legs in the air duct tape
your man 
all wanna watch me
all wanna jock me
take 'em and send 'em straight to bed
when they stop me
have 'em with sheets over their head, like a nazi
