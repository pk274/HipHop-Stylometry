right side, right side, hey
before we walk, we must crawl
but we run when temptation calls
left side, left side, hey
right side, right side, hey
before we walk, we must crawl
but we run when temptation calls


often i'm caught up in confusion in tryna find solutions
to try and pimp the system that's a form of prostitution, i'm ready
the city probably see me as a nuisance, deadly
singing the devil's song in a repetitive medley, i know
but shorty fire and she admire that i'm a pyro
maniac, i said "where you at, and do you have geico?
i need insurance that you could sex me the best."
and she started sexting through texts
and sent pictures under her dress
got them g-strings, she beasting for the pleasure and pain
i was a weakling, so i cling to her under my name
gave her the ding-ding, then "ding ding," the bell ringing again
it was intriguing that she seen, don't no stand
no flow, keeping it wet, making it rain
beg your pardon, don't blowjob, she no jobs like tommy from martin
the blowjobs, she blow hard like a nintendo cartridge
that blowjob had genius like mozart
got blowjob, then put it in her trunk like goyard
i'm starting off with that cuevo
shop on rodeo, house in the dagos
we like to fuck and watch the day go by
hasta luego, drop the potato
she's hot, what can i say, yo?
