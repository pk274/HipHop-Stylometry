living my life like i'm living right
in the midst of a fire pit, the gangbanging and violence
is the sweetest song, and i roam with the heart of a violin
don't violate my patience i'm waiting... to kill a man
as i stare at the ceiling fan, as a fan of these wicked streets
if i gotta eat, i steal like a metal piece
i'm screamin' out, "fuck the police"
i'm dealing my cards with jokers on em
you can disown him or stone him
i'm throwing them rocks back with the fury of bullets
you couldn't live your life for the moment
when i'm foaming at the mouth and my sharpest of teeth showing
i'm in the back of a black buick finna black out, like februaryâ€”
ain't that's how blacks do it, right?
i cut off my ears before i hear your advice and vice versa
i'm screaming for help as loud as i can, but that's not working
i'm working them corners like blueprints
then caught a l on my first offense
the judge threw the book at me and said this:
