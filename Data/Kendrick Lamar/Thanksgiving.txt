reporting live from compton, california
north cackalack


now everybody just bow to the greatness or die in the matrix
you're hereby datin', my destiny's waitin'
my itinerary is very hectic
i break records on every record, i'm truly reckless
kendrick lamar, no audemar on my wrist
it's arthritis from holdin' it down, bitch
me and my down bitch, get busy
i'm busy takin' overt
he world with the weight of the world on my shoulder
my drive is not to be chauffeured
i'm live, come to the harvest, welcome the artist
whose lyrics out of the orbit
more than the hardest rapper to hit the market
and market myself as a shootin' target
with offers that got me up in these offices often
boo-yaa, who ya? no one, i've done situated myself, i ain't lyin'
be sure to befriend 'cause my foes die five times
the good kid from the mad city
holdin' a cereal box instead of a glock
in a 1992 cadillac that i got from my pops
transmission slippin', but i ain't trippin', swallow my pride
pop in my tape and roll the window down
like stacie homie when airing out indo'
i wish a nigga would


a yes, yes, y'all, and you don't stop
a yes, yes, y'all, and you don't stop
a yes, yes, y'all, and you don't stop
kendrick, show these motherfuckers how we rock
a yes, yes, y'all, and you don't stop
a yes, yes, y'all, and you don't stop
a yes, yes, y'all, and you don't stop
big pooh, show these motherfuckers how we rock


a yes, yes, y'all, and you don't stop
a yes, yes, y'all, and you don't stop
a yes, yes, y'all, and you don't stop
kendrick, show these motherfuckers how we rock
a yes, yes, y'all, and you don't stop
a yes, yes, y'all, and you don't stop
a yes, yes, y'all, and you don't stop
big pooh, show these motherfuckers how we rock


me and big pooh like the definition of a two-man city zoo
even zeus can get beat up from punchlines
when i kick it and pump mine, i gotta be a prophet
i gotta make a profit big enough to have a thirty pound wallet
i'm a hub city representer, so i gotta represent the
city like a district attorney beatin' the case for killers
might walk around in a gurney, this is my sickest winter
since i had the flu and flew in the hospital with the shivers
u-p-s, i deliver
little brown boy get the pick of the litter
no glitter, all guts, no glory
station on repeat, they retread the same story
new niggas bore me, tryna put rest to that old shit
have a plate, that food for your soul tip
drill it in your head, youngin', this that real hipâ€“
hop along 'fore you get your little ass whipped


a yes, yes, y'all, and you don't stop
a yes, yes, y'all, and you don't stop
a yes, yes, y'all, and you don't stop
kendrick, show these motherfuckers how we rock
a yes, yes, y'all, and you don't stop
a yes, yes, y'all, and you don't stop
a yes, yes, y'all, and you don't stop
big pooh, show these motherfuckers how we rock
