that's the way it's got to be
that's the way it's got to be


you niggas know what it is, i need not tell you
my track record so long, it probably derail you
the historian, known for pullin' out deloreans
so i can take you niggas back, hear screams from the audience
drivin' reckless, smith-n-wesson, turnin' on west end
i got that bruce leeroy glow, you know, fluorescent
lights, damn right, you better stay with a weapon and-
that's the way it's got to be
especially in 2011
my preference be anything with a trigger
make me kill me a nigga
i see inferior niggas, 'bout to blow at any minute
my hat low, the coupe tinted
now salute the lieutenant, loot
all in my pockets, stop it, nigga
i am the forbes list
now, where the morgue?
let me kill 'em some more
this big pimpin', make your bitch open the door, see-
that's the way it's got to be


and that's the way that i like it
set the tone before i was grown, before you could bite it
my blueprint was mapped out way before you could write it
i dropped the bomb before you could light it
bitch, i'm the nicest
which is ironic, because i smoke mean kush
and fuck george bush, that's for the record
still two-hundred for a record, where's your budget?
i ain't budgin', and-
that's the way it's got to be
and bitch, you'd better believe that
she ask me where my ego go, let me feed that
i said alright, just ask the valet where my keys at
you know that murci-Ã©-lago, hater, relax
i put my last blunt up in the air, then put my fingers in her hair
then let her do what you dare her to do
and i ain't through until the rock & roll hall of fame, player
that's the way it's got to be
you fuckin' right
