say she hate it when i'm super faded
know that only notice her body rather her conversation
rushin', lustin' sexual favors when the hours chasing
midnight at 2 pm, a vampire in jordan laces
prey on the blood of the promiscuous
panties on the premises, pantry full of condoms
fuck your conscious, let's get intimate
she said, "baby boy slow down
you know i move with diligence
you think that i'm a ho' now and strip me from my innocence?"
hmm...she was older, she was colder than the rest of 'em
lurkin' over my shoulder, temptation getting the best of her
so much...i never knew how to touch a real woman
"kendrick, i want you to make me feel something."
pulled down my pants and then she glanced at me with a smirk
repeatedly shook my hand i said, "what's wrong should i kiss it first?
i can do that i won't complain"
she said, "that ain't a problem i'm wet
but first you gotta fuck my brain like a surgeon
get your mental working
like a 9 to 5, before we get it live and close the curtains."
i thought a massage was all i need
now proceed if it's worth it
or leave if it's urgent
for you to rendezvous, i know your needs have a purpose
cause i have feelings too
and you have feelings, but that's only in your teeth when they're hurtin'
i started laughin'
she pulled my card like pitty-pat
pity the fool for any kitty-kat, it's the look of lust
