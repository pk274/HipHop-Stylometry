i was down, bad, then my life switched (then my life switched)
what a crisis, my black seville with no license (no license)
i was lifeless, i was deadweight, i was triflin' (i was triflin')
then my eye twitched, then my hand shook, and my fist balled
then my right wrist took a risk for us
saw lightning that made titans (i was triflin')
with a pitchfork, we ate yo' food then got bent more
with excitement, big wars on my neck piece
vvs be fightin', move fast like loose jazz
i gotta race the world and be vibrant
no plates on my scrape, yeah, that's mando
massaging the handle left hand on the candle (huh)
i'm too high profile to drive lambo, that there is a scandal
that man grab a handful (huh)
never been loved (easy), bet i pull up (beep beep)
i got a thing for her, i wanna fuck (freaky)
fuck it up, fuck it up, fuck it up, fuck it up, fuckin' it up (easy)
i got a thing for her
i mean i get you niggas out the way right now today, you say so
take the safe and doctor pay 'em aimin' 'fore the case closed
operate, then meet the player move on then for escrow
hol' up wait, since section 8 that's on my day to day though
man-man don't shake hand, he pop shit (out the way)
she stargaze out through the cosmic (out the way)
amped up, we blew out the metropolis (out the way)
and i've been too involved, huh (out the way)
and i got tens on call, huh (out the way)
and you pretend you ball, huh
i'ma do this for my dawg, you need a life jacket
throw you in the deep end, that's now my target practice
never been love (easy), bet i pull up (beep beep)
i got a thing for her
