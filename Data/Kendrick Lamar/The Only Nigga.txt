oh, lord, oh, lord
pretty ass girl over there, come play on ma nappy hair! (*laugh*)
drizzy drake, here we go, look


bitch, i'm gettin’ it how i live, i put that on my left rib
25 with no kids but this dick you can babysit
25 lighters in the sky, what life is a real nigga
20 al-qaeda bomb when i do sight 'fore i kill niggas
passion my preference, benjamin franklin my medicine
the mvp let him in, i'ma fuck up his letterman
jackets with pendants on them
and i got plenty war story, politic never depended on ’em
uncle sam never did shit for me, momma made miracles
choppers drove me hysterical, cartoons and cereal
pyramids on imperial, that's the projects
and i make that progress from a tedious process
i'm a problem better yet a prospect, fuck that i'm a loch ness monster
conquer, compton, hail king k-dot, aka them casings of ak just sprayed your way uh, compensate for shooting for the stars muhafucka, click, brrt
shooting up the charts, muhfucka
see, a rich nigga will buy anything that you sell 'em
a broke nigga believe anything that you tell 'em
i let smokers pump my gas, but i do that very seldom
drop your ass at the unemployment, the only way i help 'em
they call me a role model, i'm still a baby myself
hungover from last night, got to speak at your school at 12
hennessy with the sprite had me bouncing like rumpelstiltskin
they caught me rummaging through women, i’m laughing like elliott wilson (*laugh*)
pay me respect and pay me on my checks
my first 50 thousand collected paid off some street debts
you know killers that looked out for me back when i was hungry
we go back like reebok classics and black and blue saucony
i got a genuine clean slate, never you ask for my fucking rate
never i’m handing out favors, bitch, every show now is 200k
as i write down my new bucket list, i can look down on your fucking hate
get the fuck up when i'm in your presence, you listen when i fucking say


"what the fuck you niggas want from me? the only nigga that i owe is god!
huh? huh? drizzy
what the fuck these niggas want from me? the only nigga that i owe is god!"
