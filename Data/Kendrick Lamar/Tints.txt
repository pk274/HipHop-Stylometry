you probably think a nigga trollin’ (like)
or showin' out for the cameras (right)
fuck i'm doin' fish-bowlin’? ('side)
one hunnid thou' on the passenger
bitch, i'm kendrick lamar, respect me from afar
i was made in his image, you call me a god
everybody in attendance, i'm about to perform
everybody get offended by the shit i got on
like, can you buy that, nigga?
nine hundred horse, can you drive that, nigga?
a g5, can you fly that, nigga?
i need tints so i can look at the snakes and posers
(i need tint) 'cause bomb head is non-disclosure
(i need tint) so i can live with a peace of mind
without niggas takin' a piece of mine
and peace be still and not do fines, so fuck a fix-it ticket
you pull me over and might see one of your bitches, ahh!
