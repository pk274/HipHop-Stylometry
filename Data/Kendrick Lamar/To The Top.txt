look at you - came from ground zero to the top
made something from nothing on that project block
switch your hustle, no more working that dope spot
middle finger to cops, tell 'em that we're legal now
yes, we legal now, do it for our people now
finally we eating now, make sure our belly's stay full


yo, rock - let me get it, let me breathe on it for a minute
speak for a minute, put my 2 cent in it for a second
let them get a view of my mind, backpack tucked with a nine
went to school with it, didn't play with it
didn't tell nobody it was mine
it was my weapon, had it for protection
i didn't blink, not for a second
didn't pour my heart and soul to a reverend
they're hypocrite anyway, rather put my full faith in god
had to stay on my grind something like when i was sumping
had to maintain my function back against the wall, they fronting
played the background like a movie extra
extra activities, no remedy for the crime going on, same old song
bet ya couldn't make it out here if you wasn't wasn't that strong
not mentally, but physically, had to get my psychology on
mama said i gotta come home, but i didn't, stayed out real late
my excuse was ''how we gon' eat if it's no food on the plate?''
now wait - think back, yeah yeah nigga, far far back
came from the bottom to the tip top, now tell me how you love that?
