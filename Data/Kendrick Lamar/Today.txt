bumping some sade rolling my window down and hitting the highway
no it's not friday, but it's my day and sometimes shit gotta go my way
niggas got me fucked up thinking that my music don't stick like some nunchucks
top dawg and we all stars like we run chucks, but nevermind that
take a trip to outer space show you where my mind at
you know where my grind at
inside of the studio is where i spend my time at
fuck over the game till i make that bitch climax
miss me with that bullshit, haters die young you can run to the pulpit
pullin off the pit stop, card like a flip flop
bitches clap at me like they wanna make my piss hot
i don't even trip though i don't need no company
me, i'm thinking long-term tryin' build a company
kendrick the good kid


nigga what i compose be so potent
that if the earth dried i could spit back the ocean
then hop on the jet ski and start westcoastin'
i'm not boasting or bragging
not a person, i'm a dragon
taking action in the heat of the night
so if the devil came, tell him that i'll be alright
i'm so high off life that i can od
walk outside then sniff a whole key
oh lady don't call the police
it's just the average joe walking with his heart on his appendix
don't be afraid to speak
so to speak, you niggas not within arm-reach
y'all midget macks swingin' on shaq now have a seat
you can never co-exist with my mommas oldest
kendrick be thy name i got my mind right
my nigga locked in the pen that's why my mind write
ink over my brain, wha's up?!


so let me start off the third verse
pickin' off your favorites since i'm cursed
fuck the system, fuck the truth, fuck religion
fuck the government, fuck the law, fuck the prisons
fuck george bush, fuck rappers who love dissing
fuck you because you don't see my vision
i fucked your new girlfriend too because she's cute
and the ass look like a grenade within the denim
fuck the groupies, fuck the gossipin' bitches
fuck niggas who can't fight so pull triggers
fuck the new world gas price that costs a living
fuck your love, fuck your hate, fuck your snitching
and whether you fuck with me or not
i don't give a fuck you could keep your props
fuck keeping it real, i'mma keep it k-dot
kendrick everyday, jay-z didn't lie
fucka!
