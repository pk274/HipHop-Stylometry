kendrick lamar the modern day malcolm
humble and modest but these margins can move a mountain
i moshpit on the beat and leave the mark of a thousand marksmen
clearing the street and killing rappers with talent, preach
yes i said talent, kendrick ain't scared of y'all, can’t even spell competitor
lord is my witness
i remember asking artists in streets how they did it
the only features i got is was this handsome face i was getting
how ironic, playing sonic was the shit like a colonic
now we vomit over these beats while critics pay homage
this is too street like my 23 summers in compton
i go so deep, like my dick in your bitch hope the condom never do leak
2 seats, one car, all you hear yes daddy and snapped bras
high salary blow jobs, high calorie rap bars not me
my sweet 16 probably need a school id
and usually i be, the dominant victor
you know what time it is nigga
affirmative action, you fact or you fiction?
i’m a slain cracker from being insane
pop a vein when i write this shit
i’m think on the shit, i'm vain and i think you’re a bitch
a female poodle under some homo's voodoo, sucking the industry's dick
we catching bodies, fades in the hotel lobby, fuck your security
and that's at the ritz-carlton
my impurity's probably your best asset
i spit acid, hit your block and crumble your address
leaving them stagnant
this is torture when i tort-ya, or escort you
out the building where ex-convicts with all sorts of
permeant handshakes, your man can’t stick to the script with handpaint
popping your lip then popping the clip then popping your van, wait
we keep the piece, but want the peace
said i was malcolm to your belief whats up

(beat 3: kurupt - i'm burnt)


feeling like a motherfucking animal
hannibal lechter of 2012
elected to execute every rapper that has excelled
if music your calling
then you balling, pick up yourself
if a nigga said he could see me
bet he told you in braille, fucker
put you on front street, then buy some bread
nigga you lunch meat, should've worked at subway instead
goliath couldn't bare my triumph
i'm a leader, walk behind me as i walk through zion
swinging swords like i'm sparring with a spartan
watch they face drop when the beat drop
i drop a real jewel like a martin, fool
me and curtains ballin' like peewee kirkland callin' 'em kirk franklin
stomp 'em, leave 'em hurting
no judgement for a plaintiff
they tried to find me guilty for spitting filthy as o.d.b
but i've been o.d. since '03
that's march 14th, my first recordings
i kicked it's like sweet chin music on chuck norris
