and a nigga was built with a steel heart
k. dot on the beat, everybody said they smell fart
shit on anybody, i'm a rappin' porta potty
and i probaby gotta dump right now
see my hobby is to murder every rapper on the planet
make 'em leave the studio in ambulances
with a bandage on their cranium
i'm bangin' them on sight, with the bars of titanium
brass knuckles, i beat niggas down, who wanna scuffle?
i’m rude like sayin' ‘fuck you’ to your mother for no reason, now that's cold thinkin'
what am i drinkin'?
i do, spiteful shit, shit like fuck your bitch
record it, then mail it to your residence
say hello to the unforgiving flow, cold with it
grab a coke we gon' be here for a minute
i tell every rapper fall back when i see 'em
or get clapped like a bitch with gonorrhea
