what is a bitch in a miniskirt?
a man in his feelings with bitter nerve
what is a woman that really hurt?
a demon, you're better off killing her
what is a relative making repetitive narratives
on how you did it first?
that is a predator, hit reverse
all of your presidents' evil thirst
what is a neighborhood rep'table?
that is a snitch on a pedestal
what is a house with a better view?
a family broken in variables
what is a rapper with jewelry?
a way that i show my maturity
what if i call on security?
that mean i'm calling on god for purity
i went and got me a therapist
i can debatе on my theories and sharing it (woah)
consolidate all my comparisons
humblin' up bеcause time was imperative (woah)
started to feel like it's only one answer
to everything, i don't know where it is (woah)
popping a bottle of claritin (woah)
is it my head or my arrogance? (woah)
shaking and moving, like, what am i doing?
i'm flipping my time through the rolodex
indulging myself and my life and my music
the world that i'm in is a cul-de-sac
the world that we in is just menacing
the demons portrayed as religionous
i wake in the morning, another appointment
i hope the psychologist listenin'


sometimes i gotta vent, i don't have no one to talk to
gotta put my pride aside just to call you
these piano keys, they study me well
kids, listen up, i got some stories to tell


this bitch said my woman not black
because she light skinned with her head down her back, uh
see, growing up, none of us niggas cared about that, uh
we all off the top ramen
we all in apartments looking at martin on broke recliners (i know she know)
i say, "what's your feelings on that?", she say, "fuck them hoes"
she say it's sad to see black women act different to other black women
clashing and color ad-libbing to fuck over each other
when half of our mothers' conditions did the dirty work for us
"so what’s the dirty work?", she said, "nigga, we insecure
from a grown man’s insecurity
lack of profession, lack of maturity
manipulation like sex the only reason for you and me
we tolerate this
your perception of bad bitches make us hate the next bitch
so i ain't mad when they be mad, and speaking on me
take a jab, because i got heart and i look the part with a lookin' ass"
i understand it's deeper than colorism
i said, "what about the ones that pray?", she said, "fuck them bitches"
"'cause they be praying on your downfall, wannabe feminists, turn into serpents around y'all"
maybe i'm sensitive, maybe observant, maybe i'm flawed, maybe been through too much
living life in the ghetto as a woman kept us in cuffs
cause the light-skinned get picked on, the dark-skinned don't get picked
whoever choose sides need to die so we can exist


some of you niggas need tranquilizer
some of you bitches need tranquilizer
some of you crackers need tranquilizer
and i vow to put you all down
you got me fucked up
and i vow to put you all down


i seen the liars, i seen the opportunists, i seen the tired
i seen my own flesh and blood try to sue me
i seen it coming, this day made desires
i give and give 'till i can't give no more
then forget to forgive once i don't feel no more
who took advantage of you? how foul do you gotta play to get a w?
they'll smile in your mother's face, then try and hustle you
wish i can make this all up, i cannot share enough of me
it was them versus us (us), had to swap out my company
no more, you fuck with me
maybe i'm too sensitive, forever live would be trill
especially when my intentions is to set sail
the family fortune further would go, but that's a fantasy
i'm fortunate, 'cause now i know


some of you niggas need tranquilizer
some of you bitches need tranquilizer
some of you crackers need tranquilizer
and i vow to put you all down
you got me fucked up
and i vow to put you all down


sometimes i vent
she said, "whatever you feel right now, just vent"
he said, "however you feel right now, just..."
she said, "whatever you feel right now, just vent"
and i vow to put you all down
