anybody can get it
send 'em in a cloud if you think sky's the limit
i'm foul, like an elbow intended
in the game, no winning even if it is a scrimmage
you can get coached right now
black phil jackson maxin'
cooler than george bush when the planes went down
as far as rappin'?
i should be a wordsmith
porsche gt swerve like cursive (beep beep)
y'all wait on wayne to drop c3
i drop c4, bomb on you (i mean war)
no white flag, put 'em in a full body cast
like a sitcom, make 'em sit calm, i sip dom p
bumpin' the iselys, with a bitch on
my wee wee like i been in france too long
need another level, been advanced too long
niggas want war come on
