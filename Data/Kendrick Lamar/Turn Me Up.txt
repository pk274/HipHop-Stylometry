come come now
pac told me fuck the world, i'm 'bout to cum now
i've been a pro, but now i'm profound
propane on posers, restraining from the doja
imagine if i smoke, i probably come up with a quote
so heavy you'll forget every album you heard from hova
or 2pacalypse i'm hub city's novelist
come and get your scholarship, i'm taking kids to school
a pool full of spit, dive in, i'm 'bout to drool
you'll drown trynna backstroke on concepts that i wrote
i was a black sheep, but now i'm just a goat
and i'm 'bout to elope, married to the game joe
this is hip hop at its finest, where'd you find this? in a ziploc
til the wheels fall off, fuck a pit-stop or what not
where my tear drop? i murdered it
my pot-holes is turbulence
i'm in the sky wit it
when you listening to kendrick, just


cause i just gotta be heard
i just gotta be heard
i just gotta be heard
said i gotta be, yes sir i gotta be
heard, heard, heard, heard
