i was sitting on the couch reading yellow paper
a letter in reply, 7 days later after i wrote 'em
"stay strong, keep your faith in god," what i told him
hoping that he's listening
said that they tried to give him like a hundred years
what a coincidence, i was bumping some plies
i can taste the salt from my tears
as the water had start to flood on my eyes
i know it gotta be hard being 21
doing time in the pen and your gram's old
your brother's getting older
and the streets is getting colder
and your hoping that he's focused to stay on the right road
sleeping in a cell, it's been 30 weeks
ain't recieved any mail
it's cold and the hole stinks
and you can't even blink without niggas testing your life
as i read every word that you write, i can only imagine
jason keaton, i can only imagine


sitting on the couch, that was my uncle bobby
after he just got out, 15 years to count
haven't seen the world in so long
haven't seen a girl in so long
and before the sun came up, he was gone
like a fiend off the best rock
trying to get his life together, or what not
typed his name in the system and they couldn't find his identity
got it straight, got a place, found some serenity
found a job, found his mother's grave site, found a 40 ounce
then he found god, then he bounced, then he found a new chick
two kids, wide hips, found something in her we didn't see
found this spot in pasadena and shack with her, an investment
then found guilty, somebody had yelled domestic
violence on my uncle, was working with two strikes
only out a year, now facing life
i can only imagine
that's fucked up
i can only imagine, uncle bob


sitting on the couch, thinking about the ratio
of blacks in prison as compact in prison
when blacks pack with minorities
system grab more of these 18 year olds
18 year sentence with no parole
the state won't oversee
they make the term severe, a conspiracy?
that's what i call it, it's full of shit
a toilet can help quick, the government help?
no, just put us on death row
just give us some more guns, then give us some more coke
then give us another chair, then give us some more rope
then hang it like right there, yeah
it's justice for all but 90 percent unfair
care? no
alcatraz was purchased by a white man
for 5 grand, with intentions to expand
more prisons
so these correctionals ain't for rehabilitation
they for grossing a bigger business
imagine
we're being used
imagine
the truth shall be told
