yea, this shit got me feelin' kinda like sunday evenin'
on the pulpit, me and my heathens
me and consequence circle your seven continents all in one weekend
make sure your proposal is decent, get exposed to treason
the last of the dyin' mohicans when mentionin' rappers
my niggas'll rat-tat-tat you, then kiss your mother right after
disaster'll strike faster than a thief in the night
the thesis of a black man, policemen never could write
that's why our backs against the walls, gun raised
takin' out everything, like bank withdrawals before the year 2k
and by the end of the day, i'll be america's most wanted
shot and confronted while runnin' from the cia
livin' life as a rebel, the last panther stuck in the ghetto
tuckin' the metal like junkyards and rockstars
the smoke never settles, where i'm from
from a tree to the corner-stores is where we hung, uhh
