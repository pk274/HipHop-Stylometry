temptation sweet, i taste it
that casino waitress, drinks sedated
you the one i want, you the one i want, face it
you the one i want on a one-on-one basis
you can see my weakness, a week is not long enough
i need every season and this the only reason
you the one i want, you the one i want
leave it all on the table even if they catch me cheatin'
doin' blackjack, twenty-one, twenty thousand in it
probably twenty more before i'm done
if gambling's a sin, then i'm rollin' dice with lucifer
to make sure i ain't losin' you
that's what a craps shooter does, i'm bankin' on the win
bankin' on the last, vacant from the job that i had
life savings in my pocket
if i never make it back, then i had the option of takin' a risk
so before i slit my wrist, i'm a cash in on this last poker chip
you can bet
