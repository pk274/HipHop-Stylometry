but there's one thing on my mind
and it's about the one boy i had when i was sixteen
and he'd ride in from the very first day
forging alibis for the empty room
as the wind would blow me right back
into the world outside i know
and it don't matter how bright you look
my baby don't care about your heart
so why don't you tell me
maybe i don't belong to you
don't want to be on your own
and then again, i'll be sure to say
i'm not your average, average guy
you have the hunger and the focus
but i am not that cool, that's enough
and we'll be dreaming a little bit
we'll get lost and we'll land on the ground
and when i say i'm not thinking at all
it's not that my heart isn't beating
it's just that...well...i don't know


and you know that i won't be back (ayy, ayy, yo)
i've been watching the sky go upside down (hey, huh)
i've been watching you through my eyes (ooh)
well, i'm careful what you want from me (hey, uh)
all the things you ought to be (i thought...)
