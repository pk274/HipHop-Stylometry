look inside my eyes and tell me you see a warrior
i never felt the feeling of euphoria
pain forever or prolong the pros and cons of prosperity is strong
wake up in the morning and i gotta win
not taking the victory, that's my only sin
and so i send a message to your messenger
a warning shot to let em know i'm serious
i'm ready for a war, when i roar it can break a glass window
the only thing for sure: the perfect way to bend you
on your back even if i gotta slither through the cracks
i can crack every code you deliver, i attack
every hole where the bomb squad sit it on the tripod
even if you try hard, he can still die hard
run but you can't hide: white flags
you can pull em out fast and tell me your last goodbye


i will, i will climb the highest mountain
before the flood comes
and all my fight is drowning in blood
what i got to lose? what i got to prove?
i guess war is my love


make sure your next move is slick, your best move is nothing
you know i take risk: dark clouds, i love it
cause i can hide in the mist, hop out
and crush every soldier you're with, so i'm 6 for 6
i'm sick with determination: i'll terminate ya quick
i lead the pack, i follow no rules
i see the traps, i know you're close to
falling on your face, unload, reload
hand me another case, explode, explode
the fire of my eyes is waiting on your demise
i know you hope your help is close by


i will, i will climb the highest mountain
before the flood comes
and all my fight is drowning in blood
what i got to lose? what i got to prove?
i guess war is my love
