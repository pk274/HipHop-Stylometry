come on
yeah
punch, what's happening brother?
niggas be poppin' that shit at me like it's something new to me or something, know what i'm talking about
i tell a nigga quick, that shit just a rerun to me, nigga
i've been doing this shit since vanguard, brother
and tell me what's happening with it
niggas hate on me but hop right on my dick as soon as they see me
soon as they see me, they be like


what up doc
that's what they tell me every second around the clock
everytime i clock in, rappers checkin' they watch
studio paid for, hours unlimited
assholes, how many mc's i knock off they payroll?
how many god mc's i knock off they halo?
hip-hop ainâ€™t dead, consumers changed up
rappers love to see gold like the end of a rainbow
i stay low, like my socks under my ankles
play the back like a turtle shell, know well
that my team got me if i ever slack on my shit, so if i fall?
guess what, i don't even trip
it's like that, crushin' little battle raps
punchlines, i did that in '99, you think it's a gold mine when you think of one
you think you hot, but i think you done
like queens, new york slang, look what the killer brung
machine guns to a fight, fucking right
pay the bill or i'm turning out your lights, good night
i shatter niggas' dreams, thinkin' they the west coast kings
till i drop like visine, tell a nigga quick, it ain't always what it seems
like the stitching on swap meet jeans
i'm itching to scratch a whack rapper, gun clapper, snuff him like a rude capper
got a cool bladder, but i'm pissed off, at ya


the real is back
fuck the artificial, won't you let the realers rap
they scribble in they notebooks, me? i state facts
safe estate, they know where the best be at
whenever i ask, "are you not entertained?"
body any nigga that wanna holla my name
and what, no cut, this is top dawg gang
what the fuck, everybody else, pull your panties up


nigga said he'd snatch my chain in the streets
what chain? i barely wear jewelry
so i ever had one, you barely seen it on me
and if i ever had a gun, you wouldn't know it was on me
so snatch it and then you're done
i'm in a studio, just sipping on parmesan
thinkin' about who could fuck with kenny and paula's son
i live this shit, try stop me, you won't live to shit properly
catch four between your abdomen
next time you see me, don't ask me who i'm collabin' with
between me and you, some of the new west is actresses
new hate activists, lowkey can't stand our shit
but still we continue to drink laxatives
cold blooded, make the label hand me your budget
this is mine don't touch (pow pow), did i stutter?
catch two, cats knew, i been a gorilla, welcome to the zoo
yup, you little monkeys know what it do, come test me


the real is back
fuck the artificial, won't you let the realers rap
they scribble in they notebooks, me? i state facts
safe estate, they know where the best be at
whenever i ask, "are you not entertained?"
body, any nigga that wanna holla my name
and what, no cuts, this is top dawg gang
what the fuck, everybody else, pull your panties up


dayum, you killin' 'em k-dizzle
and if you don't kill 'em, then you send 'em to hospitals
sleepin' on a recliner bed, with a thin pillow
i'm with a white bitch, ass like a black widow
bet i dribble to the end of my lifeline
so when i die, you can say i balled for a long time
the 0-8 frankenstein, beast like sasquatch
feet size thirty-six, steppin' on hip-hop 'cause that's my bitch
i write a rhyme, then she ride my dick
the girl is mine, i don't know the ho that you with
you niggas know this, i'm way better than i've ever been
so focused, like a sniper when he zoom in
what's your motive?
i bet it's to go against, like the gt
get your bitch ass bit, all on these streets
i'm the almighty k, compton
rep it 'til my very death day, let the reaper in his face
and recite every song from nwa
i pay homage for those great who paved the way
wait, back to the subject of who's, and who doesn't do what i do
bluffin' until i touch 'em like a masseuse do
nothing compares to me, but the throne, so tell 'em bring the chair to me
i'm a rare bully, small nigga but i handle y'all niggas like i'm eight feet tall
nigga
