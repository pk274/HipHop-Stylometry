i'm sure to pluck any chicken with a rhythm i could fuck
i tell 'em call me up
like is it on or what?
can i cut 'til dawn, or what?
a slut say she want a slice of all of us
intelligent, say her marble's marvelous
she go down south like black colleges
i'm a psychologist, i tell her i can adjust
anything in the world that be bothering her
everywhere i go, guarantee she go
pussy pop on the low, like a silencer


back to the realest shit, cop a car, mash that
crash that, then i'm back at the dealership

big truck kicking up dust—conquer
chocolate seats—willy wonka

you struck by lightning, frightening, gotta be a heisman
trophy, low-key, the one and only
slay a ho, play a ho like a oldie
yup, and i'm dope like opie
um, so i'm out when the police
come, like a nut, i'm a nut
for the bucks like a shotgun bust, and i bust
venom inside the brains of young dames
like mr. dash speaking to his kids on jay-
z—we runnin' the game
y'all slipping like run in the rain
ya bitches running away from y'all to us
in god we trust, at y'all we bust
