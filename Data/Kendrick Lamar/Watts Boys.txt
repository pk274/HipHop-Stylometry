k.dot get dough
k.dot get paid
k.dot get hoes
k.dot is not afraid
whenever them vultures, start flocking 'round my way
got my back against the wall, uh, i'm ready to spray
standing by the lightpost, breakfast
got my hand on my hand on my right toes
cause shit gets, hotter than hell's kitchen
when fingers itching, it's more scratching
the djs practice mixing
it's not baseball, but we stay pitching
no waist like
