okay, i'm riding through leimert, my tires in reverse
i'm lost but i know this foreign navigation works
i made a right on king, i seen a couple skirts
i said "bitch get in but dust them sandals off first"
okay, i'm doing 105 on 105
witnesses had said they seen a ball of fire
bitch i'm tryna president at jive while you talking jive
all these presidents, won't be surprised if one came alive
i only fuck with playas and pimps nigga
you a created player like sims nigga
my cup be filled up to the brim nigga
yo bitch fixing her make-up in my rims nigga
you just target practice
everybody say they seen it but nobody know what happened
what happened yesterday baby girl fix your mood
cause i don't like my head with some attitude
and i don't like your legs 'less they at the roof
pedicure toward the ceiling, mollys in the cabinet too
pop, pop, pop, popping pussy rather casual
section 80 paid me ho so this is what i had to do
ball, i ball, iphone, million dollar missed calls
i hit the bank, withdrawals
i make her plank, with no drawers
mothafucka, i ball
