moving through the block like a centipede
no rooftop, who hot? i'mma show them where the antifreeze
i hit the dealership, and tell them hand me keys, like a grand pianist
damage anything said, then landing on top of your bitch, oops i tripped
i'm clumsy like michelle williams, or jaleel white
i feel like a predator, and none of you danny glovers are ready for, alien tactics
the god is back, they're on their knees praying like a mantis
as i perform like santa clause
pause tvs in the phantom
bitches on my left and my right like i pant them
dancing on the coast, emerging from the smoke
pimping in my blood, tell doc to check my pulse
they knew that was k.dot the gemini, with another cut like a samurai
anything else is uncivilized
fucker
