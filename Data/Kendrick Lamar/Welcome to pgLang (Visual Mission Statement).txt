too many opinions in the glasshouse
this world full of ego, let me cash out

two trench coats in the bag
baby keem, king of rap
and i think he just came back
how the fuck did i go back? (pglang)
get your case off my back (pglang)
that my son, wait, relax (it's the language)
beat my son, go to your room (pglang, pglang)
stop sneak-dissin', that ain't bool
play both sides, huh
she love all my guys, huh
