at first, i did love you
but now i just wanna fuck
late nights thinkin' of you
until i get my nut
tossed and turned, lesson learned
you was my first girlfriend
bridges burned, all across the board
destroyed, but what for?


when i get signed, homie, i'ma act a fool
hit the dance floor, strobe lights in the room
snatch your little secretary bitch for the homies
blue-eyed devil with a fat-ass monkey
i'ma buy a brand new caddy on vogues
trunk the hood up, two times, deuce-four
platinum on everythin', platinum on weddin' ring
married to the game and a bad bitch chose
when i get signed, homie, i'ma buy a strap
straight from the cia, set it on my lap
take a few m-16s to the hood
pass 'em all out on the block, what's good?
i'ma put the compton swap meet by the white house
republican run up, get socked out
hit the press with a cuban link on my neck
uneducated, but i got a million-dollar check like that

at first, i did love you (love you)
but now i just wanna fuck (i just wanna fuck)
late nights thinkin' of you (of you)
until i get my nut ('til i get my nut)
tossed and turned, lesson learned
you was my first girlfriend
bridges burned, all across the board (across the board)
destroyed, but what for?

what you want you? a house or a car?
forty acres and a mule, a piano, a guitar?
anythin', see, my name is uncle sam, i'm your dog
motherfucker, you can live at the mall
i know your kind (that's why i'm kind)
don't have receipts (oh, man, that's fine)
pay me later, wear those gators
cliché? then say, "fuck your haters"
i can see the baller in you, i can see the dollar in you
little white lies, but it's no white-collar in you
but it's whatever though because i'm still followin' you
because you make me live forever, baby
count it all together, baby
then hit the register and make me feel better, baby
your horoscope is a gemini, two sides
so you better cop everything two times
two coupes, two chains, two c-notes
too much ain't enough, both we know
christmas, tell 'em what's on your wish list
get it all, you deserve it, kendrick
and when you hit the white house, do you
but remember, you ain't pass economics in school
and everything you buy, taxes will deny
i'll wesley snipe your ass before thirty-five


yeah, lookin' down, it's quite a drop (it's quite a drop, drop, drop)
lookin' good when you're on top (we’re on top together)
you got a medal for us
leavin' metaphors metaphysically in a state of euphoria
look both ways before you cross my mind
