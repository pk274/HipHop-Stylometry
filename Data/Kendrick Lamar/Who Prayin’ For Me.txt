ain't nobody prayin' for me
ain't nobody prayin' for me
ain't nobody prayin' for me
ain't nobody prayin'


i feel my niggas been outta pocket, i feel nigga's empty-ass pockets
i feel like niggas debating on who the greatest, who stop it? i ain't a legend
i feel like all of you is spendin', i feel like all of you is desprate, i feel like all it take is a second to feel like, ye west whenever holdin' a real mic
i ain't feeling your presence, feel like you gon' learn you a lesson
feel like only me and the music though, i feel like your sibling ain't your mutual
i feel like the enemy you should know, feel like, the feeling of poor homes, the feelin' of bad poe's
a quarter dollar manipulated with stones
that feeling, the feeling of false freedom, you force feed 'em the poison to fill 'em up to they 'texes
i feel like it's just me, though, i feel like you ain't read, though, i feel like you just sleep, though
i feel heartless, often, often thus, this feeling of fallin' of fallin', of fallin' apart with those hours lost, "and ya lost it"
filling the void of being employed then ballin'
streets is talkin', "fill up those blanks with coffins"
rather then fill up the banks with dollars, but they fill the graves with fathers, fill up they babies with bullshit
internet blogs, and pulpit, kill em' with gossip
i feel like this gotta be the feeling where pa' was
the feeling of an apocalypse happening, but it's all so awkward, the feelin' won't prosper, the feeling is toxic, he felt like he boxing demons, monsters, false prophets, schemin', sponsors, but no industry promises
niggas, bitches, druggies, all someone
church, religion, tokens, blacks in judgement
lost they visits to bein' assertive to cops, and
fuck your feelings, i mean this for importers
i can feel it, the phoenix sure to watch us
i can feel it, the dream is more than process
i can put a regime that forms a loch ness
i can feel it, the scream that haunts all logic
i feel like sayin' sum, i feel like takin' sum
i feel like skating off, i feel like waitin' for 'em
maybe it's too late for them
i feel like the whole world want me to pray for them, but who the fuck prayin' for me?


ain't nobody prayin' for me
who prayin' for me?
ain't nobody prayin'
