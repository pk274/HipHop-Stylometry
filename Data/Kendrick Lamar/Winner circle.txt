life never did seem like it seen some life in me
lights in the cloud that read, "little nigga just use yo head you might can be
just like mike on the mic", jordan
you’re recording more than twice a week
that’s not enough if you’re nice as thee eminems
you mimic them legends but your work ethic is quite petite
everything you like somehow retreat
from the page i’m so impatient
pacin back and forth my sleeping pattern is getting badder than insomniacs
i’m a zombie at the studio, can you ponder that?
i soon will blow like an arsonist
all i wanna do is be heard uh
all i ever do is strike nerves (huh!)
a lot of fuck niggas and a lot of fuck bitches
that’s one thing that i observe (uh!)
cus when you doin you, everybody seem cool
til you fuck around, get a blessing
and you look in the mirror, see the same old nigga
but everybody around you stressin'
i ain’t ask nobody for nothing
i went and got it my own nigga it’s nothin
and if you don’t condone or respect that
then step back off my nuts nigga it’s fuck ya
i got a an appetite for more supper
and i lack advice for these suckers
and i sacrifice what i made, god bless my days while i’m in this circle
ridin
