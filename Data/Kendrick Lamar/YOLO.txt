uh huh, take no chances, stop freelancin'
invest in your future, don't dilute your finances
401k, make sure it's low risk
then get some real estate (how much?), 4.2%
thirty-year mortgage, that's important, that's a great deal
and if you can't afford it, don't forge it on your last bill
renting is for suckers right now
a dependable savings and you'll retire with money in your account
beast!
