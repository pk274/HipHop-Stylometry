pop 'til it's vacant
pop 'til the wrist pop
pop 'til he shakin'
pop like four on the floor been in rotation
no allegation
popular demand, i understand my name is only for conversation
new york nigga be like, "deadass"
l.a. nigga be like, "on the dead homies"
i was off the porch like fed-ex
211, got bread on me
k-dot twilight, the zeitgeist
roll like fried rice and tempura shrimp, uh
temporary pimp, nah, don't remember them
just canary yellow gem, jumping out the fuckin' gym, uh
swang like new dana dane, i ride dirty
paid like two damon wayans, retire early, uh
fade like shadows, the stallion, the cattle
a bitches decision for you is narrow
collision, the money and fame, the pharaoh
the physic, the chemist, the lame
collateral for kendrick whenever exchange
compatible for riches with more to gain
i said, nigga, yeah right
i don't fair fight but i bear fight
lookin' for my next roadkill for the headlight
hangin' on my last four kills for the highlights
my life, high life, high five, bye-bye
