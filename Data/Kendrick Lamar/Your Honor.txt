oakland and 2pac
i move oak, you see, i'm nothin' like 
i'm so far ahead of my time
i got people five years from now pressin' rewind
i'm hardly impressed with y'all
i hate rappers, where the true artists at?
if it ain't a good picture you draw, don't bring it to the architect
often y'all arguin' about who got next
claimin' y'all runnin' the game, niggas is barely walkin' yet
hoppin' all over beats without going through trainin' camp
try studyin' a few greats, then maybe you'll be where i'm at
your songwritin' ain't great, your mixtapes' medioc'
you recycle the same quotes, you're not switchin' your flow
your flow in the same place
don't just
