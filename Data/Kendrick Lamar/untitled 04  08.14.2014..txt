they say the government mislead the youth, youth, youth, youth
(tell 'em when you went to the park and everybody came back and...)
and welfare don't mean well for you, you, you, you
(what about when you tried to do a side for that but you...)
they tell me that my bill's past due, due, due, due
(talk about the charge you got...)
and preacher man don't always tell the truth, truth, truth, truth
(do you believe in god? if you don't, it's cool)
