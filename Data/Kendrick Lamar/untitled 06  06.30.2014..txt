these metamorphic supernatural forces dominate what i see
a gemini, duality personalities always conflicted me


oh! but don't be scared of me, girl
i can explain
i know it's foreign to you
i know it's hard to believe
god give me the favor
let me explain
more than a compliment
and i could use some assistance, let me show you how
i can explain
oh shando! i spin around two times
i'll be there with the answer
let me explain


my mama told me that i was different the moment i was invented
estranged baby, no i'm not ashamed
i recommend every inch of your lunatic ways
praise the lord, you teach the kids how to be themself and plenty more
you know the male species can be redundant
i mean we love a woman and think we can satisfy her
between sheets, covers and pillows
i'm promising your lack of tolerance stuck on a zero
i'm promising that i'm acknowledging you as my hero
cause you believe in me
no you're not easily impressed
but i possess qualities that you need to see
look at my flaws, look at my flaws
look at my imperfections in awe
look how you unique that my mystique is a round of applause
and yours equally valued
you stick out like an alien compared to those around you
and that's alright because i like it
you and me are the same
hopefully i'm invited, hopefully you don't change
because i know for sure who you are


i can explain
your mama raised you, your daddy raised you
hand-washing your clothes on sunday
let me explain
walking your brother to school, three miles away
to feed the mind and soul
i can explain
don't you explain that, don't you explain the reason why your mind, it travels
let me explain
i wanna know what you think
i wanna pick your brain when i see you
but don't you ever
let me explain
oh shando! i spin around two times
a blessing in disguise
i can explain
i know for sure who you are
you're the goddess of the odd
i am yours
i can explain


i am yours
i am yours
i am yours
i am yours
