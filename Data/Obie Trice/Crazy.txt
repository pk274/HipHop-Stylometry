trice is the truth, puncture your roof
if what i enunciate ain't getting through you
listen nigga, school craft raised me
hey bay-bay, you don't wanna fucking play with me
i got the k covered up in the back
got the pistol on my side nigga, o stay strapped
stacks in the jeans, this is a natural thing
i don't act out a movie, i'm actually the scene
i pull up on the scene, nigga holla back
with a bad bitch italian and black
they don't take double takes, they take kodaks
coast through the club relaxed, where the v.i.p. at
coast under the cub, post underneath the duds
supposed to, i'm a motherfucking thug
but they say he crazy cause he don't give a fuck
first nigga play me, light his ass up


say i need ritalin, cause when the choppers start riddling
bodies start dropping, disappearing
tempers start flaring, nigga nutting up
ain't no coming back from that bruh
ay, bad days some faggot in a bag
give a fuck what neighborhood you at
what dilla dick you sucking, when the pistols bucking
lord knows someone family's suffering
and i ain't the nigga that'll start the beef
i lay back, i ain't got a problem with g
but lick her and niggas like twelve hits of e
suicidal, somebody on their way to meet jesus
these demons keep chasing me
get away from me, or the ak speaks
no wonder why they see him as a freak
say he crazy, in the motherfucking street
