doody, i drop a tear in a rhyme
the day you find it is the day i stop missin' deshaun
holton, it was written, it was woven
for a soldier to leave so suddenly, got me wide open
how could god take a soul so dope and
turn around, leave us all heartbroken?
know that you're sayin', "keep goin'!
be a man! no emotion! it's your duty!"
until we meet again, doody
