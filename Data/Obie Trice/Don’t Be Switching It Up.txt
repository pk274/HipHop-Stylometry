haha
obie trice!
woo! yeah
o trice, nigga
rest in peace big proof, nigga


niggas be fake, got they mommas trace
the bitch in that man, the snitch in that man
our sissy peep the switch in that man
shit hit the fan, that nigga ran
he ain't got your best interest at hand, when the tension expand, your dick in the sand
you ain't real with it, my nigga, quit playin'
too much heat, motherfucka, get a fan (whoo kid!)

bullet in my head, less than an inch from dead
yeah, nobody to get you a permanent bed
ashes in a urn, your turn, what was said
this shit burn, layin' your nigga to rest
especially if you thorough like mitchell & ness
courage in that boys chest, not typical, bitch
i re-evaluate who i fuck with
cause most niggas chicks, they be iffy as shit (damn!)
they don't lay a nigga down, they just talkin' real loud
first to bounce will spark to come about
they bark at the main target and the problem in the crowd
claimin' he a partner, that's partial, now
if i don't know a nigga from a child, i don't fuck with him
he don't know what my mentality's about
all the casualties out, i was close to
this is o, i been through it, livin' proof


shady took a loss, came cryin' on o dog
my nigga in the coffin, still the boss that he was
i'm talkin' to my niggas thats 
woo!
