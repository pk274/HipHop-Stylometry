the weed is costin', so alcohol is often
engulfed in obie trice pee more than that thc
depression get me to drink more, but i did that before even when i wasn't stressin
it's like barley, bacardi stimulate my body to the point i might crash your party
hungover the next morning, remember the shit hardly
7-up motherfucker don't bother me
at times i get intimate with a bitch and my dick goes limp but i'm still a pimp
yes, my liver resembles a shrimp, cirrhosis so close while i wild out irish rose
hold my dick while me and bizarre pose for them extra fat hoes, gamin' to get us home
jumped my bones, i was drunk and gone, i gotta leave these wild drugs alone nigga


vodka, brandy, whiskey, brew
bizarre, obie trice, brain cells through
ecstasy, vicodin hikes up my heart rate
fuck it being high runs right up my alleyway
i drink like you eat, you don't eat like i drink though, not even fatsos
i guzzle, no sipper, wet my whiskers, get wit' cha
challenge anybody crushin' liquor nigga
