obie the person that came up introverted
'cause of nervousness, that was solely the only verdict
it was worth it 'cause he changed, became so observant
servin' such of a purpose
if you knew him earlier in his days, it's like a different version
so much hurtin' and pain gave him game for certain
that's why it's curtains in this murder, if you get him worked up
i'm so assertive on these muthafuckas acting tougher
had enough of isolatin' myself in a room
writing poems and songs, doing the same in school
now look what he became, a fool
'cause he learned how to sustain his tool and obtain fame from you
livin' hard but still julliard
a god walks and ain't spend a day in the pew
regardless of this i draw visual, pictures when a nigga vents
so welcome to the art department
