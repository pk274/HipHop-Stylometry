i'm from where diapers full of feces we's endangered species
bodies lay in traffic, that's right, where the streets be
you ain't seen nothin' this obscene from no tv
you would have to be me to feel what obie's speakin'
bodies leak like steel pipes, it's real creepy
ch-ch-ch-ha-ha-ha, jason vorhee's
you're borin' me with your story, i'm a detroitee
craft took my mind so the craft exploits me


i got no pot to piss in, en route to prison
you don't want it with us nigga, we strapped with nitroglicerin
our ambitions is some riders, thrivin' off poor decisions
a blessin' nigga still livin', still pimpin', still visions of
sittin' in that foreign whip, whippin' up cola, take a lick
to my tongue, numb from the shit
my nuts hung since i was a young one
and that's just the slum fuck of it
i'm pumped daddy gone but, gun in my palm
my mama can't save me, her gender is wrong
on my own in this jungle that niggas call home
what? his mama died from a lump in her d cup
police freeze 'em up for serving these glucks
it's like a habitual situation, we stuck
the ritual is for niggas to grab they nuts
and just soak all this bullshit up, where i'm from?


i'm from real bridge 'cause, for niggas livin' hard
welfare scarers just most chicks'll buy them broad
pimpin' the government 'cause government pimpin' us
rather see 'em sufferin' than niggas livin' up
'cause you ain't heard? bird got birds
but the nigga got murd' 'cause niggas felt he ain't deserve
what he was worth, he ain't a real nigga from the turf
he was birth with money, that's why they left him bloody
i'm from the streets where most these niggas nutty
i adapt to 'em, i'm exactly in tune with 'em
strapped with the mac that extract flesh from humans
home sweet home, better known as the ruins
