*gunshot*
let's go!
pyrex, big shouts out to everybody on schoolcraft, trife life crew!


niggas tryin' to take shots at me
like i don't hold my own
like grown's not in me 'cause i'm on
like i ain't come up, off schoolcraft avenue
smackin' up bitch-niggas, actin' sorta how you do

and my model gettin' hollow in my brain 'cause of your games
you don't like me, don't come up and holler nicely
fight me, so we can end this shit rightfully
but you're not, you's a chick
i'm speakin' on any you niggas who swishin' dicks
first you was my mans, now you can't stand the fact
i'm sitting on contracts, two
