we got you niggas nervous on purpose
to hurt your focus, you's not mcs
you's worthless, you's not them gs
you's a circus, you's no appeal, please
use curtains
you use words kool herc slurred in two-thousand-third, you's perpin'
you's no threat, who's you servin'?
when lyrically oughta bury you beneath the dirt when
you fuck with a label overseein' the earth
shady, motherfucker, o. trice's birth
and as i mold, i become more cursed
so we can put down the verse, take it to the turf
cock and squeeze, and he who reach the hearse
is he who depicts fiction in his verse
and as i breathe, and you be deceased
the world believe you deceived just to speak
you's not the streets, you's the desk
use not your chest, nigga, use a vest
before tools choose your rest, you chose death
six feet deep, nigga, that's the depth
