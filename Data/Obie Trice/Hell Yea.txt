they say he lonely, he ain't got big homie
he strayed from interscope now they don't know me
only reason he succeeded was reverse e
or maybe he was nursed by a doc beat
but slim and dre's still in my dna

or maybe he was nursed by a doc beat
but slim and dre's still in my dna
consume my body, found a trace of gangsta party
but i don't give a fuck in my artery
it's bme but fam forever part of me


i'mma have to go on without quote-unquote
(hell yeah) you know the boy trice dope
put a few of you niggas through high school
hyped ya iq, average man into a psycho
(obie!) you know i got 'em big homie
this ain't so long, i just had to own me
bme 'til a nigga c.p
i'mma do it for the d (hell yea)


yeah, it broke my heart seein beans and hova
as a music listener i know who y'all vote for
but e'rything black's not white, white's not black
that's the music business for ya
but as a consumer 'stead of you gettin a tumor
you opt out for the obvious bloomer
but the least obvious the one that'll do ya
that's learned knowledge from comin up in the sewer
and i ain't wreckin my cap to (fuze) the gap
i just want (yoo-hoo), this is the music to adapt
and if that ain't real rap
obie trice need to fall back - fuck that

through digi' design might lose my mind
so the digits i make won't be a surprise
eyes wide open, obie know you're fake
you ain't gotta say a word, i can see through your make
wait 'til i get in hip-hop i'mma take
give it to the needy, he who appreciates
no it's not the hustle
but you gotta have some type of love for this culture i grew up to
muster up somethin for the folks who appreciate vocals
'stead of them duds that make 'em roast you
who am i to coach as well?
i'mma take a different approach, you niggas pound-sign, fail


i'mma have to go on without quote-unquote
(hell yeah) you know the boy trice dope
