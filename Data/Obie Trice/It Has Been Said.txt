since b.i.g. taught us niggas to think big
i'm been about my business since then, so anxious
it ain't how we live, it's what he said, he did it for brooklyn
this i took in, sent chills through my skin
vicious, i'm experiencing the same sights as him
it's what excited obie to write these poems
rolling, going through the same shit he spoken
open up my eyes so there's no limit in them skies
when ready to die was a sick part of my life
palming that forty-five, plotting to pop my mind
then that crooked eye jamaican i'd so many times rewind
got me to walk a straight line and get up on my grind
get up out the system, who could give him better signs
no pop of mine could top big poppa rhymes
so possibly i'd be popular, huh?
that's the inspiration i got from my nigga b.i
