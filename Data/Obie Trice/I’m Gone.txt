kay slay! (yeah) yo..
drama king! (yeah!)
check it out, check it out, o. trice!
(shady records nigga, it's going down once again, boy)
it's just a scratch, man (let's go, em)


i'm gone bitch
shady records motherfucker, we gone, bitch
i said we gone bitch, so long, bitch
catch up if you can, we moving on, bitch


now who you know been to kyoto, tokyo
off of one debut, screaming, "i'm in janai yo!"?
obie trice, showed you right
he done seen overseas, he's not a prototype (nah)
nobody's protégé, em only showed o. the way
fuck what the media say
if you listen to music then you should know that o. trice fused it
in a matter where he speaks how the streets views it
choose, to translate it through the art of music
and started using it reaching the youth
influenced by the truth in it (truth!)
and as a boy, a man, i ran from boys in vans
do the knowledge, acknowledge and try to comprehend
hand full of contraband
a product of my environment, narcotics and violence
inspires the content, but my intent is
to retire these tired-ass writers in si-lence (yeah!)
cause haters they hate us cause shady became famous
and claimed the rap game when they thought he'd be nameless (hah!)
but racist accusations won't change us
let the truth be told, you think o. will be over here
like, "master, show them you got soul!"
no, anybody knows us knows that's not how we roll
so, i still push the bucket
if i ain't trust it i wouldn't fuck with it
but fuck it, i'm gone bitch!
