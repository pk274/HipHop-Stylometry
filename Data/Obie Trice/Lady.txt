can we re-enact biggie's song?
can you shit on me? i just want you to shit on me, obie


baby i'm extra large (huge) in magnitude
and magnums the lubrication that i use
to chose which hole on a ho i abuse
have 'em confused, can't tell who is who
when i fuck the shit out you, then the next day (bitch)
i'll rush the shit out you off my two-way (ooh wait)
you wanna cuddle, emotional hustle up on pocono's
poke ya nose in and outta obie's own
no, i'm in and out your home
and this in, and out your tone
i ain't the nigga that settles 'em down
put 'em in nice homes and floss 'em around
i bounce 'em around, camcord the sex
and sell 'em around town, how that sound?
if i was in love with ya, now you wanna clown?
fuck with them clowns until i pound on your crown
bust a few rounds and the cops come and get me
bad mouth a nigga just to convince a jury
you don't want it with me, you just horny as me
you want a nut, nothing but what it should be


see you looking at the life, you looking at the lights
you looking at the ice, you ain't looking at the trice
you should look at some advice when i say he ain't nice
despite the fact you think you the feisty type
o love to fight, i love the drama
love when my bitch get to cussing out yolanda (fuck you, bitch!)
find the obie condom on the counter
swinging her weave, can't breathe like i can't believe!
least i ain't deceive and try to mislead
and sell a dream just to get you on my team
i came clean to keep down the beef
keep down my reach, you can keep all your teeth, sweety
