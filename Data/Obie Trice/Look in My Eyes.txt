every man determined his definition of realness
what's real to him
everybody got their own definition of gangsta, man
okay, this is my definition of gangsta


surprise motherfuckers
you thought i never would arise motherfuckers
it's obie trice motherfuckers
look in the eyes of a real guy
i ain't got time for lies, niggas frontin' like they lyin'
nigga ya not tough decease the bluff
these streets is too heated up for you to front
dre laced the beat, heated up for you to bump
real name no gimmicks, give my niggas what they want
fuck the image and the blunt, that ain't rap dog
be who you wanna be, but let it be fact dog
we'll never let a nigga tell you how you should act dog
specially when you're fuckin with automatic gats, dog
these niggas ain't playin', i'm sayin'
i'm sprayin', i do my dirty work with my hands
i'm a man, layin' a nigga down, he advance
you fuckin' with my plans, i'm lookin for the tooth


now when obie's up to bat, they asked obie
how you cope with that, cope aesthetically man
i kobe bryant rap
i'm so defiant that the lines uninviting my rhyme
i swear i'm outta my mind sometimes
out on the grind, my kind
nickel and dime niggas we ain't rich yet
we on the corner with a 40 and a biscuit
ready for bitch shit, have you drinkin' we ain't got good sense
my hood so tense, niggas so dense
i see through the life you invent (fake-ass niggas)
slow up on how you niggas vent
you niggas ain't representin' shit
i represent school crowd killas, detroit nigga
my nigga what, the realest exploit niggas
my nigga what, what's the point in avoidin' your feelings
you niggas feel us, we drillin' you with lyrics motherfuckers
real life experiences, eminem gave the clearance
so i'm here to show you niggas brilliance
build it, shady marine no civilian
o-trice you fuckin' with a real one


this is what the streets done to me, hung-ary
gun on me, hopes high only keep change up community
give it up imunnity, raise future me's
you look in my eyes that's the dream obie's seen
man it seems it's as easy as the rhyme obie brings
but my eye shows things intervene
all in between it's like losin' my team
losin' my freedom, losin' my mind, in the bing
the being i'm a being graduated from rights of beings
to a be-enz congratulated on life's sirenes
on your biatch i done came too far
to go backwards, my aim to extreme for y'all


shady
look in my eyes man, it ain't shit but real talk over here nigga
i would never send you elsewhere
i got hair on my nuts nigga, grown man shit
that's how a nigga get into clubs nigga
when i ain't got no id
flash my nuts on they ass
they walk me right in nigga
hahahaha, yeah, obie trice
