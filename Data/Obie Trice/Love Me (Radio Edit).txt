you don't see me in the hood
that's 'cause i'm doin' this, man


niggas, i'm still grindin' (yeah), i still hearin' those sirens
i'm still gettin' chased by those lights
only the light's lime, and my mic's on
and my time is none, because i'm writin' more
and i ain't here to meet a soul in this business
i'm here to eat, speak, until these hoes feel this (for sure)
and i can't let y'all derail me, man
i got young kobie, homie, you gotta let go of obie
'cause obie be back (going nowhere, man)
we got them craps goin' on and that yacht goin' on
soon as a nigga touch down, back from tourin'
it's whatever (whatever, man), put that on the cheddar, man
but in the meantime, it's jimmy iovine time (show 'em)
chase cheese, rhyme 'til my voice give out (show 'em)
this is it my niggas, this what we boast about
now i'm here, so shut your motherfuckin' mouth
and show me love, bitch


i just wanna love ya
for the rest of my life (i don't love you, bitch)
i wanna hold you in the mornin' (ha-ha)
hold you through the night (ha-ha, right)
i just wanna love ya (we wanna love alcohol)
for the rest of my life (we wanna love guns)
i wanna hold you in the mornin' (we wanna love money, ha)
hold you through the night (we don't wanna love no bitches, though)


i just wanna love ya
for the rest of my life
i wanna hold you in the mornin'
hold you through the night (and all the bitches say)
i just wanna love ya
for the rest of my life
i wanna hold you in the mornin'
hold you through the night
