ayo, loyalty's first, all the bullshit second
i showed you on the record «cheers» to who respect it
most of these niggas neglect it
even though it's a known method
from the hectic hood that you slept in
you wanna be an exception
that's when the weapon is leaving you half steppin'
with that 'caine in your left hand
obie from a section that'll stain up your flesh and
have you on bed rest
questioning your affection for streets
d-twizzie no question
one of the best groups that done it
and obie is their reflection
lil homie that know soley that loyalty is reppin'
d-twizzie for (yo) life, obie trice is second
