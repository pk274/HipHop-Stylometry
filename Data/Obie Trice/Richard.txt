yeah, trice
the statik selektah


o back around the corner, got the crack
put in your orders, we 'bout to run up out the storages
it's notorious, the way i got big spitting stories
bme's x-clan, vanglorious
we're not your favorite, fuck it, you know the system
and you buck it, have you revisiting how you used to love it
my niggas spew through the music, acoustics
school kid used to pursue excuses
truth is, i was truant in school
so its influence is foolish, that was my views
iâ€™m back at it, the rap addict, by any means
we gonna get these stacks accurate, no skinny jeans
say he ain't a star, niggas might be right
i'm so regular, nigga gotta shit tonight
take it back, selektah, let 'em know it's trice
put your seatbelts on, we gon' ride tonight


that's my motives, jumpin' off in rovers
all white, like i was right up in the dakotas
or minnesota, did i mention soda?
when it's mixed with the yola, watch my cup runneth over
cut from a soldier, them ho niggas disposable toaster
putting holes in a nigga getting close enough
bme 'til the credits roll
'til my condition is beyond what the medics know
they wanna edit o, like a prosthetic third
leg let it go, this is shady 1.0, em let 'em know
i still profit through the process
the prize in my jeans my balls'll never digress
i'm a dick that i brag about
i put it in faster than i drag it out
world, i be your special friend see
'cause these suckas suffer from pseudo-penis envy... so!
