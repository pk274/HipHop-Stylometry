they say, "why don't we increase the peace?"
the only piece increased is that which deletes your peeps
'cause niggas run mouths but they don't run streets
till that fo'-five will cease your speech
yeah, it's a shame how the beef'll creep
could've reached ya peak, now you're left with a horrible leak
i'm tryin' to be as bleak with my speech as possible
just in case a nigga tryin' to throw me an obstacle
nigga, i'm not boxin' you, i'm hospitable
i put you in a hospital, that's how i get at you
let the doc op- on you, he don't rid you?
you back on the streets, i send another hit at you
this is not a hypocritical issue
i will critical condition your tissue, give a fuck
if all ten of them with you, i throw an extra ten of them missiles
turn gangstas into gentlemen, vicko
and ever since eminem dissed you
i swear i see the woman and bitch in you
all this bickerin' back and forth over who signs who
curtis pulled your skirt up, nigga, you got murdered
now take it like a man and shake it off, damn!
and quit tellin' all these magazines your plans
how you gon' slap up my mans? you're fict-ious
nigga, we'll send stan to come murder your bitches


ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha
yeah
go hide behind all the gangstas you want, nigga
matter of fact
go get every gangsta from every hood
in the united states of america to back you, nigga
ain't nobody ridin' wit you
you can't see that?
you fell off, nigga
ha-ha-ha-ha-ha
damn
shady slash aftermath, mothafucker
2003 to infinity!
yeah!
