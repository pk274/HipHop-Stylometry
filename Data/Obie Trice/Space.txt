yeah


they say he fell off his axis, and put me on the blacklist
say i ain't half as passionate without marshall mathers
i actually rather be chasin' my own rations
instead of gettin' fractions, pushin' someone else's establishment
got a heavy track record accurate, never went backwards unless
once or twice i made some wack shit
but that's it, facts spit, come back, and i'm that lit
with two fifths and black chick with two lips on my black dick
now everybody wanna adlib, congratulate my hustle
got them stacks all in my duffle, i ain't braggin' about no couple
baggin' up my bundle, i'm just calculatin' up double
album out, matter of fact, go up-low, uh-oh
nuts so, nigga's like, "whassup o', where you've been?"
studio, locked in, reinventin' who i've been
bingin' off that liquor like i'm 22 once again
face all in that porcelain, poisonin' my organins


you see the struggle never endin' and long as i'm musicinin'
and switchin' positions in this industry, it's so sickenin'
'til you simulate the situation i've been in
can't face what o's been in and brace obie's condition
we rely on faith, pacin' to get a hit in
if grace is forbidden then ace is never hittin'
play my cards right in case you niggas listenin'
erase whatever bullshit you got up in your system
niggas wanna be dissin' him, put him in remission
give a fuck what y'all mention, while you gossip like some bitches
i done came out of them trenches (came out of them trenches)
cocaine and my niggas, slangin' off them benches
i'm from michigan, dividend to sentencin'
ain't livin' in my senses, you ain't
