i never woulda thought that i'd see you out of control
even though my penis was deep down in your hole
you should know, between us, we was like mates of soul
nothin' could intervene us, especially no hoes
you was more so the chalant type i chose
'til more shows, haunted you nights, i suppose
that's how it go: with time spent, emotion grows
in the beginning friends, we decided to roll
so who's responsible when you get excited, explode
and obie's grinnin', then you invite that obie's cold
but bitches they gon' talk, niggas they gon' hate
we established this way before we became mates
so what's required is that you chill with all that fire
get your desire when i retire andâ€”
