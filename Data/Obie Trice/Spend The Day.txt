what the problem is? ain't it obvious?
i got a thing for you, we need to handle bizz
take you to the crib, play with your esophagus
get your nose snotty, eyes watery
i just wanna party with you, got the party bus
we doing 1800 shots, all of us
you bring the honeys, i can bring hustlers
and we can muster up conversation to discuss
and i'm gonna put it in your brain, like you're reading zane
jumping off from skyscraper, you ain't die in vain
you came and became my little mamma
miss do anything, no drama
runs in your stockings, no comma
when we encounter, you appreciate kitchen counters
all's i need is 24 hours
watch obie show you that the world's ours


say she love my aura, how my hustle unfold
way i herd 'em with the 'ye, just call me amber rose
pretty toes, no pimples, no blotch
no proactiv, note the girl's hot
they rolled a carpet whenever that the girls are out
make sure it's red cause i made sure bottoms are
my bottom broad, you can catch us at the bar
no tops on the bottles, exactly how the models are
you know i put your ass together like a model car
now your head's getting big, a few followers
on twitter with venus and serena
trice due to serve it whenever he's between them
this obgyn
you say you're bi-curious, then bring your friends
we can get it in until ante meridiem
wake up, roll over, then we do it again
come on
