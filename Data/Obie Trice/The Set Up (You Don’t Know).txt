bitch i see you
bitch you know i know you
yeah, i know you


thick thighs but she full of surprises
i swear this bitch is shady (that's what i know)
sex on her mind all the time
and you think that that's your baby (you don't know)
you a good guy that's living a lie
but she told 'em where your safe be (it's what i know)
if you cool and she satisfied
how come that bitch just paged me? (you don't know)


last time i saw you
you was brewed up, booed up, ready for a new fuck
last time you saw me
i was p.i. to the mothafuckin' m.p., what?
and lately i heard you's a broke bitch
livin in the lower class suburb
and lately the word is i live in a suburb
and i don't fuck with birds
she used to pump on the block
sell a nigga rocks, bail a nigga out, but
she tried to plot on a nigga
vacant lot one shot bitch died go figure
he used to pay this bitch
gave her lots of shit, fuck's wrong with this nigga, man?
he used to bring her through the hood
treat the bitch too fuckin good, my opinion
we used to blaze with the bitch
faded off the lick she x-rated the clip
this nigga bought braids for the bitch
louis vuitton kicks and tricked on some sucka shit
meanwhile in the hood she drivin around good
this bitch thinks she's in hollywood
meantime she settin the nigga up
telling us what his stuff she's ready to get him stuck, what?

we had to ride on a nigga, watch him
for the right time to get richer
we decided when the hit was
run up on him, 45 in the ribs, what?
this nigga screamed like a bitch
showed us where his shit, hit a hell of a lick
but the bitch, who told us 'bout the bricks
exposed us to the nigga, he knew that we'd come
but meanwhile in his hood
his niggas is suiting up and timbed, looted up
rims and new trucks your man livin' it up
then a van with no hubs suddenly pulled up and erupt
shot a nigga the fuck up, just my luck
the bitch got us both touched, it's like a rush
the bitch who blushed and smoked blunts with us
turned out to be nuts, switched up
mixed up with the wrong slut
got my frame zipped up in the bag, it's all bad
my niggas got my back, in fact
they caught on her ave, flossin in another nigga cab
