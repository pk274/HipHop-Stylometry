yeah
aye, em, you ready?
herc, you got them thangs nigga? (you know)
detroit city!


there they go, them d-town boys carry the calico
whenever there's war, you gotsta know
them boys got toys tear down the front door
detroit make noise everywhere that we go
there they go, there they go


you are not convincing
when detroit blocks stay flocked with henchmen
niggas get popped for instance, infrared dot for distance
get knocked by the cops, cop on some pen shit
straight detention, a nigga doing tension
once released he on that music buisness
when viewing 106 and them cafeterias
only to find that rap's actually serious
deliriously resort back to crack and vigilence
same shit that sent em upper michigan
us is pimping, a difference, from any city i visited
it's that detroit spirit and if we in it, balling out till the ending, period
use o as a reference to that sentence
the message i'm sending you, best just pay attention


there they go, them d-town boys carry the calico
whenever there's war, you gotsta know
them boys got toys tear down the front door
detroit make noise everywhere that we go
there they go, there they go


there they go, them d-town boys carry the calico
whenever there's war, you gotsta know
them boys got toys tear down the front door
detroit make noise everywhere that we go
there they go, there they go


there they go, them d-town boys carry the calico
whenever there's war, you gotsta know
them boys got toys tear down the front door
detroit make noise everywhere that we go
there they go, there they go
