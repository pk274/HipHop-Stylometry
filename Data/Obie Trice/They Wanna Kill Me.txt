ot's history's in the streets

homie if you subtract the voice
i'd still be giving invoices to fiends for selling them

thank god i'm in this roof
left the same night, bullet by his brain, right?
a couple more inches coulda been a night night
but the almighty wasn't ready for o. trice
i'm still here like day and night
you thought i was deceased, saw my way to them bright lights
i still manage, nigga my head's damaged
that ain't stop o. from getting cabbage, faggots (kill me!)
these niggas wanna see me dead
'cause the intelligence that flow through my head
wanna be a sharp shooter better be a fed
'cause i ain't going no fuckin' where
