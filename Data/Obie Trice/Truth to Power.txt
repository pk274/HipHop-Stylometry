i don't with fuck with you niggas you all fake
i don't see the point in your hearts, to pulsate
yea you problamatic on social media
apologetic when approach greetin' ya
this what the culture leadin' to
yellow backs with jeans squeezing their penises
and we supposed to receive them as rap geniuses
are we supposed to believe what niggas feeding us
when they sweeter than jujubes, reese's pieces


my heart goes out to orlando
and every man and women representing that rainbow
the game i represent we don't switch them lanes though
this is hiphop, this not a flame show
my daughter listening while niggas grabbing they ankles
so self-consciously this might take hold
and you can blame it on idiosyncrasies
i know where your secrets lead
these sissys wearing it on they sleeves
