i don't even like you dog but since you here
i might as well throw yo' up out of that chair
put you in a figure 4
grab my beer and crack you over the head with it and buy some more
i'm so secure with my thug life
that i rarely start fights, the name's on y'all (come on!)
obie trice, the name's all me
dirty like the dozen you hear on cd
or sick like the notes
dogmatic
