is what i claim but my game is dpg
and every hustler in my clique got to get his grip
and in my world a girl is considered a bitch
is money all that makes you move?
you ain't doin what'cha s'posed to so you gots ta prove
somethin to the ones you love but you needs ta know

it was a wake up, wake up, wake up
just to wake up, wake up, wake up...
wake up, wake up wake up...
get up, get up, get up..
