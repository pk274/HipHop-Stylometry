the dog saw 'im...they tear...they...looked liked they try to tear him off
i said "oh my god! they want to eat my husband"


i was sittin' at the pound about to eat dinner
had a hard day at the studio, i was gettin thinner
my nigga sparky-o was playin' basketball
and my niggas in the backyard, 'bout to squab my doggz
dirty 
(sick 'em)
it's just me and my doggz (sick 'em)
me and my doggz (sick 'em)
me and my doggz
beware, beware
get your puppy chow (sick 'em, sick 'em)


now when it comes to my doggz they stay fly like geese
but as for me i'm snoop dogg i'm soopafly like priest
i unleash my doggz then i tilt my brim
i'm bout to trip off locko 'cause he go taken my swim
i think 'cause my creamy low, get back to the pound
he gon' be itchin' like hell to put the bite on the clown
and when you look with the frown he gon' get like 1-2
and ain't a damn thang that your ass can do
i think it's 'cause he lost his big homey don killer see
who ran the whole yard and gangbanged op
and leave your ass red and yeah half-head
he's a damn fool, he'll jack you for pants leg
don't beg you're dead, and don't dare show fear
young gangsta fucked wit scrappy and red tore off his head
and all he could do was cry like a bitch
his life was a pit and mine's in the shit


(beware, beware)
(sick em) it's just me and my doggz
i keep my heat in my seat, my killers in my backyard
just in case you niggas wanna fuckin' try to act hard
....deadly serious in east los angeles and south central where people
it's just me and my doggz
encounter stray dogs on a daily basis and often bare the scars to prove it
