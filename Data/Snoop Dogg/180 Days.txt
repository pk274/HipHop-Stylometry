'58 continental dogg
digital dashboard, no analog
turn the corner, raise the front
my music is hella loud, so is this blunt
unadulterated, funk baby
four fifteens up in the trunk, baby
what a day, i play to play
'bout to scoop up my brand new chevrolet
and it's a donk ride, duval gave it to me
it's on some florida shit, you know the flavor homie
it's stitched by slick so it's sick as fuck
police behind me, they on my nuts
but they'll never catch a g like me
i do the right thing bitch, like i was spike lee
and i might be in a iroc or a 5 point 0
or cadillac for sure, laying real low
moon roof open with the fin tails
inhale, exhale, chem trails
me and spitta, that's some real shit
crip'd up and whipped up, hand on the killswitch


say, you better know it man
from the no to the lbc
it's what we do man
we get to it like we do it
always on that fluid
spitta, snoop dogg
y'all know what time it is
