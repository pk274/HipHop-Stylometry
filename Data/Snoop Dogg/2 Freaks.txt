came in this motherfucker blue down, booyah
two down, who down? she down, you down
no, i'ma keep the pedal to the floor
oh, i had no idea that was your ho
so? do it in slow-mo 'cause i need four more
not in my house, dikembe mutombo
pick up the fumble, rumble and stumble
the bee that don't bumble, crip legs in my gumbo
spice it up, slice it up, dice it up (uh-huh)
now hop in the coupe and spend a night with us
see, i ain't tryin' to hurt nobody
but i be on one like a motherfucker though
kick back while we tic-tac a ho on the low though
me and my nigga though, here we go
sail it, bail it, go crazy
holler at 'em, sada-da-da baby
