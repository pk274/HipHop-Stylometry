up outta there
ain't nothin' but a gangsta party
eh, light that up, snoop! why you actin' like that?
ahh shit, you done fucked up now
(ain't nothin' but a gangsta party)
you done put two of america's most wanted
in the same motherfuckin' place at the same motherfuckin' time?
(ain't nothin' but a gangsta party)
ha, ha, ha, ha, y'all niggas about to feel this
(ain't nothin' but a gangsta party)
break out the champagne glasses and the motherfuckin' condoms
have one on us, a'ight?
(ain't nothin' but a gangsta party)
a toast to the gangsters


sho 'nuff, i keep my hand on my gun
'cause they got me on the run
now i'm back in the courtroom, waitin' on the outcome
"free 2pac" is all that's on a nigga's mind
but at the same time, it seems they tryin' to take mine
so i'ma get smart and get defensive and shit
and put together a million march for some gangsta shit


i've got a pit named petey, she nigerino
i've got a house out in the hills, right next to chino
and i think i've got a black beamer
but my dream is to own a fly casino
like bugsy siegel, and do it all legal
and get scooped up by the little homie in the regal
it feels good to you, baby-bubba
you see, this is for the g's and the keys, motherfucker


it's like, cuh, blood, gang-bangin'
everybody in the party doin' dope-slangin'
you gotta have paper in this world
you might get your first snatch before your eyes swirl
you doin' your job every day
and then you work so hard 'til your hair turn gray
let me tell you 'bout life and 'bout the way it is
you see, we live by the gun, so we die by the guns, kid
