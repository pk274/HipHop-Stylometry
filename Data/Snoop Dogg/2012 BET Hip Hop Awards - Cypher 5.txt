yeah, it's back on me
i guess i'll take the microphone casually
and do my thug-izzle straight from the dome
and let you niggas know that's watching at home
bet, easily, let me show you how it go
s-n double o, break down a smooth flow
breaking like dominoes
lay it on the table for you
let you a little game for your mind
get a lawyer, this is too much for you
you couldn't understand
let me drop another plan holding my left hand
moving my right hand, dropping the next game
quik doing his damn thing, i'm spitting mo' flame
preme there on the turntables cutting up shit like
snoopy d-o double g, making you get right
never, ever hit like, we do this like
west coast motherfucker, bust in your face like
what?
