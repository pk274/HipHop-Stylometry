bad little bitch that i'm bonin'
gotta get her out of my bed before six 'n the mornin'
room number four-two-izzo
pussy was good but you still gotta gizzo (gotta go)
snoopy this, snoopy that, snoop want, snoopy do
shout out to the homie, big snoopy blue
see i'm a eastside long beach, rip ridin', gang bang affiliate
i peel 'em when i kill him when i fill him with the calm of a storm
one hundred million rips, rise and reform
see this the g-call, no iphones
khakis, chucks or some nikes on
dress code, west coast, head up
shooters on the roof for the set up, now throw it up
crip, crip, crip, don't trip
pistol grip to your motherfuckin' lip, nigga
