that's that new teezo touchdown, straight
for all the dogs that's drivin' around in beaumont lookin' for some cat
all you pitbulls should know by now that hundreds in a roll look like tuna in a bowl (tuna)
this is curtis cut-a-bitch-off
and you're listenin' to bark radio, live from chapel hill
where the south was won, whatever that means
we got some new drake and sza comin' up
and we gon' be givin' away some drake tickets as well
you know he comin' to the h-town to tear the roof off that motherfucker
this is bark radio
