let's bang
let's bang, cali is active
gangbanging was attractive, so i snatched it
and i threw it in my knapsack, marinated on it
it's the way of life (life)
i'm in the mix all day and night
pitbull fights with my dogs, i bet
a hundred real niggas that ain't even from my set (what up though, cuz?)
down to put it down, in or out of town
we don't lie d-down, we just shot it out
and then make it back to the park
pulled up real slow in a seven-deuce buick skylark (what up, cuz?)
jumped out, gave dap to my young gs
everybody's active, cs and bs
in the sky, bastards of the party
nigga, we don't die, we just multiply (ride, ride, ride)
