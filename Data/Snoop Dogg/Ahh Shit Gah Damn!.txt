me and my comrade
in a room for a hoes and they all bad
i can have anyone when i want
but i can't and i ain't, so i don't
you know i get it how i live homie
i keep that motherfuckin' thang for the pigs homie
i shoot them like i shoot you
kick like it's kung-fu
mic check one-two, ahh
lean on a nigga like i'm in the post
screen on a nigga from the left coast
big dog, livin' in the matrix
big dog, we gon' take it back to the basics
