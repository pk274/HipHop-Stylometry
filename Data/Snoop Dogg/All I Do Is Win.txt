heat in the kitchen, pot on the stove
water gettin' boiled, dope being sold
snoopy in the hoopty, system overload
i been runnin' this rap game since i was twenty years old (what? what?)
i hung with the worst of 'em, bust 'til i burst 'em up
floss 'em up, toss 'em up, hardaway, cross 'em up
pardon me, i'm bossin' up, pressure up, bless you, bruh
don't mess with us, we like the u in the '80s
back to back, set a trap, hit the lick, hit it back
hit the trick, jump the track, bitch, i want my money back
time and time again while i'm sippin' on this gin
al davis said it best, "just win baby, win"
