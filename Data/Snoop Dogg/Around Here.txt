around here, we see ops how we doin'
i ain't scared, cause you know i keep some shooters
around here, she ain't your bitch if she be choosin'
a nigga took a lot of loses, but i threw 'em
drug dealer drops, i'm whippin' the pot
niggas talking on computers, y'all makin' it hot (shit)
because around here whatever happened, we don't see it nigga
i step out, now i see the kids wanna beat us
that's crazy that kids want to beat me
and i used to be like, i want to be like somebody
now they want to be like me, oohwee
gangsta grillz


gang bangin', gettin' money, yeah i set the trend
when i got out, i knew i never would go back again (back again)
i had to separate all the boys from the men
steady steppin' steady rappin' 20 crippin', keep it in
it was 88, i'm in a crack house, cookin' dope
i'm a junior in high school, i can't be lookin' broke
so i took the coke, and i took the coke, and i shook the coke, and i sold it
grabbed the pack and i grabbed the strap
now a nigga locked and loaded (loaded)
what's next to do, i'm next to you
and i have got the best from you
stay in control, save your soul, what's best for you
