around the world, around the world
around the world, around the world
around the world, around the world
around the world, around the world


catch us in m.i.a
cleveland and dallas
we be european, d-p-gin' in malice
roll up the best dro, we here now
turn up, when you get down
roll call, all my dogs, spent 10 g's at the strip mall


round and round we go
where we stop, no-one will know
baby it's 


it was all on you, now it's all on me
all around the world, this is volume three
me and my cousin, d-a-z
ain't too many spots that we don't be
mad when i play us
you know, we know the flight's 


all around the world babe
people say the same things
people say they on they own
but they do the same thing
all around the world mayne
everything's the same game
people say they on they own
but they do the same thing
