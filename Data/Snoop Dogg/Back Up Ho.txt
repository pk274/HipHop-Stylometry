goldie loc, remember this last year
all them bitches wanting their bills paid
and was calling niggas scrubs and shit
yeah, we let it slide all for the 9-9 but for the r2g
you know we got to come back on these hoes my nigga...
(for real, for real) that's real
do it dpgc dogghouse style... eastside up, check this out baby


when i wake up in the morning
you give me breakfast in my bed
and when i need a little loving
you know you're quick to give me head




it's 6 am, she won't pay him
but she will pay me, og, ba-by
they be on bullshit most of the time
hosted and fine, anxious like ginuwine
i ain't got time to be messing around
let's hit the hotel and straight put it down
you do me and i do you back
that's how a pimp player do it like that
i met you at the club so it couldn't be love
come to find out you the motherfucking scrub, on the dub
and now you wanna get in my tub and get a back scrub
from snoop d-o-dub? ha ha
hold on, put your clothes on
bitch, you ain't bout to get your doughs on
go in the kitchen and hook me up something to eat
and put the tv on bet
crack the blinds and toss me a la times
and roll one of them dimes
and make sure the radio work
and get me some orange juice with the ice in the cup
i know i'm demanding
but i'm a motherfucking pimp and i don't give a fuck
and when i wake up in the morning, bitch you know what's up

and i'll never let you go (i'll never let you go)
woo woo woo woo woo woo woo woo woo woo

woo woo woo woo woo woo woo woo woo woo
you gon' be my back up hoe
back me up, back me up
