everybody see me lookin' fly (oh, yeah)
and i think i know the reason why (oh, yeah)
'cause i got you right here by my side (oh, yeah)
and i can't let you just walk away
if i ain't with ya, i'm not okay


if you want my love (yeah)
come a little bit closer
don't make me wait (ooh)


let's do things you always wanted
have some fun and live your life
help me waste a day and find a place
that we can face-to-face
let me show you 'round my hood
it's bad meaning bad like bad meaning good
when it comes to rules, i break 'em
