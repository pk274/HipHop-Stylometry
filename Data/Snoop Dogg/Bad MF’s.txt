band of brothers, laughing at them others
gang from the gutter, some bad motherfuckers
hands on everything, the path of a hustler
my cash looking good, pulling big numbers
hustling non-stop, getting everything i need
if snoop dogg coming, you gon' smell the weed
if doggy in the building and everybody chillin'
you best believe i'm here makin' a cool million
i'm in your meeting room, feet on your table
smoking my own brand, kush from the land
laying out the plan, million-dollar man
and i ain't moving 'til a nigga put it in my hand
a hundred grand just to make a nigga dance
big money moves, a lot of shaking hands
a lot of day ones i done gave a chance
i used to make due, now i make demands
with four aces in my hand
i used to make due, now i make demands (yeah)
bad motherfucker, i took the game and ran
