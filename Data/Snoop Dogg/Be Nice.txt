if we could all just find a way to fly away
to slip into a brighter day (say what?)
one step, so deft, so right, go left
and do it to 'em right away
i'm talking to all of my leaders
we should just pow-wow, and all of us meet up
and fight for each other, not one another
and when we talk, be nice to each other
be cordial, be glad, be happy, not sad
stay in your bag
and all of my banger that bang with they flag
whether crip or blood, be good to each other
be hood to each other in the house-a, mi casa su casa
on and on, love that we givin' keeps rollin' on, rollin' on
