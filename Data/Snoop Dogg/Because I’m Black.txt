is it because i'm black?
somebody tell me, what can i do?
(cause their ain't enough bars
to hold the the drama that we've been through)


right here, right now, i do declare
that i'm more than a gangster, mack, pimp or a player
i swear i ain't never told on nobody
it started in '82 at a 'hood house party
half ded, lil' loc and my nephew d
not knowin' what we do, but this is rtc
heart sparked, puttin' flags in tucane park
i leave the house for school, but i come back after dark
you feel me?




more power, more leadership - unifying bloods and crips
i used to smoke a pack a day, i used to have to pack a k
now i've got brothers in suits in my faculty
pushin' peace in the streets - north, west, south and east
student of the game, yeah it's time to make a change
so i'm following, no more swine swallowin'
i'm gon' just walk the walk of a righteous man
try my best to rewrite this plan
as-salamu alaykum, sir
yeah, that's the plan...




yeah, i'm down with obama just to add a little drama
and i'm rollin' with the nation, but i've been doin' that
had a talk with my mama, had to let her know that i'mma
make a change, and she said: "baby, go ahead and do that"
farrakhan is a prophet and i know it cause he show it
and he told me, so i'm teachin' brothers how to be peace
what's wrong? we too strong, and if we all get along
they could never penetrate us, all they do is motivate us
haters...

the enemy is always watching for leadership that will rise among black people because it is only by organizing effectively that you can change the reality under which we live
