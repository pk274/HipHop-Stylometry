ay, you know i got it
keep it, sweep it, peep it, light it, lit it
all things cannabis, doggy d-o-doubled and did it
forever committed, they will never admit it
but i don't trip off of that, i just get right back up in it
and put my feet on the yellow brick road and walk it out
and keep my head to the sky blowin' smoke out my mouth
o's in flows, circles with the power plant
rollin' blunts, sittin' down, leavin' buds on my pants
and every chance i get to blow some kk
with my cousin ray j
these niggas actin gay-gay
ay ay, so i told my home boy maylay(?)
let me use your ak, cause they say
i been havin' money since dre day
so what, know what
also been buyin' more trees than the law allow
bang bang! shut it down, roll up another pound
it may look strange, but it feels awfully good to me
