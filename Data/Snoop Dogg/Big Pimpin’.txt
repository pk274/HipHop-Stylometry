wit' my mind on my money, and my money on my mind
we do this everyday, about the same time, biatch!


now, do i love them hoes? (hell naw!)
and why is that? (because you're snoop doggy dogg!
and you never gave a fuck about a bitch
'cause to you, bitches ain't shit but hoes and tricks)
hahaha! dee-dee-dadi-dah
listen to the sounds from my nigga doggy dogg
slidin' thru the city in a rag six-fo'
hoppin' like a muthafucka, tryna find a ho
hittin' all the spots, but i'm comin' up blank
i'm headed to the liquor sto' to get myself some drink
parks my ride, as i.. steps inside
as i.. puts my 9-double-m to my side
as i.. continue with my mission
pussy is my dish and i'm fishin', wishin'
upon a star, to come up on some mens pushin' caviar
(and a little bit of pussy) so i can get my pimp on
'cause my pen gets my pimp on, from g to ozone
