1951
mr. and mrs. jarain bones gave birth to a 7 pounds, 4 ouch, baby named jimmy
handsome little devil
jimmy would grow up fast, loving to add, subtract, multiply
in other words, jimmy was real good with numbers
so jimmy outgrew home before the average kid was grown ​
ya, dig what i'm talking about?
so, as jimmy grew old and got on his own
he went from state to state
county to county, city to city, runnin’ numbers
but there was one thing that jimmy always preached
and that was black power, black unit, soul power
so, jimmy, i know you're up there looking down and smiling
just wanna let you know
that your legend lives on, and on, and on (jimmy)
jimmy bones, what a cool cat to know, yeah (jimmy)


jimmy, jimmy


so if you'll look up at the sky, is sort of cloudy
and it looks like it’s gon' rain
then all of a sudden, thе sun appears out of nowhere
you can bеlieve, that jimmy had his hands on that baby
i was once told that martin luther king had a dream
i know for sure that jimmy bones had a plan
jimmy was the man, with the master plan
and um, as i look back, 20 years since his death
jimmy, i know you're smiling, you're proud of everything that's going down
cause we manage to take our lives in the right step
black folks pushin' together, living together, working together
education, teaching, it's all love
got to give a shout out to my main man, jimmy bones
without you, there's no me
jimmy, your legend lives on, yeah (jimmy)
jimmy bones, baby


jimmy, jimmy, jimmy
