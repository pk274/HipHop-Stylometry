oh, no, big snoop dogg
back up in the heezy, baby
you jockin' my style? you so crazy
dre say, ain't no limit to this
as long as we drop gangsta shit
look here, bitch, you fine and i dig your style
come fuck with a nigga and do it doggy style
i'll be gentle, sentimental
shit, we fucked in the rental
lincoln continental
coast-to-coast, l.a. to chicago


bitch, please!
now what you need to do is
hem my coat, and roll me some dope (fo' real)
different strokes (huh-uh) for different folks
oh, you like settin' niggas up and gettin' them locs?
a cute lil' bitch with a whole lotta heart
shit gets thick when the light gets dark
she say she got a lick for me (well, hook it up)
worth about 200 g's and 30 ki's!
now check this out, dre: now, if i don't move
then a nigga like me, shit, i don't lose
but you know me, dog, i'm movin'!
ain't nothingâ€™ to it but to get to groovin'
you've been waitin' on a nigga like me (what's that?)
to take that chance and rob your man and beat up the pussy
a victim of the circumstance
that's the devil, they always wanna dance
see we go out with a bang (bang, bang)
i'm tryin' to work this cold thang
and take this whole thang
