take a picture, you can frame one
i'mma hit you with the game gun
denzel, will smith, and halle berry
add snoop dog, that's legendary
big cars, nice homes
weed and rolls, designer clothes
blue carpet, that's how it's laid out
you see my life is a movie
so gone and play it out
i can teach you, greet you, will seat
do what i tell you and i will put in my sequel
we can walk down sunset boulevard
walk the sidewalks and hang with the stars
liar, liar, pants on fire
i want my star to be next to richard pryor's (yeah)
because i'm the people's champ, and
black hollywood, that's where i'm at
