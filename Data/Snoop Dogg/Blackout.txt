yes, yes indeed i'm popping pills and i make it hard to breathe pardon me as i ease the freeze
have a sit, take the trip with your boy swizz
mama overdose with the dogg father
i blew your back out, made you blackout
tell your friends, your cousin, and all your peeps
that everybody want a piece


let me tell you like this
i'm a long beach cadillac and always keep it crackalackin'
ya'll dont even know what's up
see guns be clapping when sons be rapping
i'ma get it cracking with it baby
put it back in then pull it back out
show you what we mean by blackout
see, 'cause a lot of ya'll don't even know how to put it on the chick she wanna give a little bit i'm tryna get all of it


(blackout, blackout) you know what it is
(blackout, blackout) yeah it is
it's the big boss dogg
(tell me, tell me can you keep it up 'til i, 'til i get enough?)
you know i'm known from making the females blackout
(blackout, blackout) you know when i step in the place
(blackout, blackout) when they see my face, they all wanna taste
(tell me, tell me can you keep it up 'til i, 'til i get enough?)
(blackout, blackout)
