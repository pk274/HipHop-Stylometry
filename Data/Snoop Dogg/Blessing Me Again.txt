i got a whole lot that i can really thank him for
when i was moving fast, he had to slow my role
out and in control, next episode (he's blessing me again)
now look here, ugh
see when you think about when everybody tells you out
see he the only that prolly really helps you out
i'm talking from experience, you hearing this? (he's blessing me again)


i took a chance for real, so i can dance up in heaven
my granny used to always tell me "you gon' be a reverend"
but how could i see what she's saying?
when i was seven i didn't wanna go to hell so i kept steppin'
reppin', for the lord, no weapon will be formed
sunshine, on the grind, take me through the storm
seems like he testing me again
but on the flip side, it's like he blessing me again
