my money is green, and my porsche is turbo
in hot pursuit, come rock with snoop

i’m in the game for real, it pays to chill
i walk in the club, and they front the bill

she'll be on my team, in my car
on the way to the spot, yes you are
toasting up, hosting us
and when we done, we west coasting love
for shendo, blowing endo

on the v.i.p. tip, maserati's in the lot
chilling with the stars, where the bottles never stop
got a model on my lap, baby show me what you got
with a cup of landy, tiffany and sandy
girls who like girls, wanna do it to daddy

one more drink gonna lead to sex
these girls is bad, the floor is packed
they shut the door down when it reach the max
whatchu tryna drink? clear or yak?

boom shakalaka, here comes the chief rocka
smoke good with t-pain, and snoop the weed doctor
big 808, now feel the base in your chakra
and watch me smoke like a shotta'
coke bottle shape, light green eyes
drunk off of love like a colt 45
i keep kush in my lungs, i'mma smoke 'til i die
just bust a bad one, for my homie d. dimes
they do it for fortune, some for fame
i got five different strains, you ever taste purple rain?
turn up the volume, adjust the game
ain't a damn thing change, still a g-thang
lil' mama whip your hair, exhale the chronic
as the smoke disappears, i'm ready to ball
your girl on my team, and she ready to fall
and if you didn't know, i'm the big snoop dogg


boom!
say what? say what?
boom!
i don't think they heard you
boom!
talk to 'em, t-pain
