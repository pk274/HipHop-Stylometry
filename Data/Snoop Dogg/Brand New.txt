i'm 'bout ownin somethin, ya dig? real estate
i'm in the '08 escalade, with brand new gucci shades
i'm flingin it, and singin it, while stayin up for days
you know my entourage, i does it extra large
blue bezels for my nizzles double what you charge
so whenever you see me you know i'm fresh to death
french tip on my nails and now my hair is fresh
in some brand new clothes, with some brand new hoes
is them phantom do's, on that brand new rolls
on another level, blue rose petals
and when i walk the block i make everyone wanna talk a lot
to brag and boast that ain't my style, to highside and profile
i'd rather blow a pound with my pound and do what you say
