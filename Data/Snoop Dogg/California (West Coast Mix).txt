born back with the slap, the big california
we the home of the gangsta rap
where the homies be actin up
but don't trip, on crip, we can back it up
strapped up, sag it up
bag it up, dressed in all black like dracula
smoke is snooptacular
i'm at a laker game, with my own seets
we got the heat, cobey, he from longbeach
and he a jump shooter, but he goin bang on ya
don't walk through the hood, without that bang on ya
baby was bad, you wanna put that ring on her
and she ball in heals, she put that pain on ya
this california lifestyle, make you wanna immitate it
it's everywhere, so don't go nowhere
