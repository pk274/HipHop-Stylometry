greetings, loved ones
let's take, take, take journey


you could travel the world
but nothing comes close to the golden coast
once you party with us
you'll be falling in love, in love, in love (hey)


toned, tan, fit and ready
turn it up 'cause it's getting heavy
wild, wild, west coast
these are the girls i love the most
i mean the ones, i mean like she's the one
kiss her, touch her, squeeze her buns (uh!)
the girl's a freak
she drive a jeep and live on the beach
i'm okay, i won't play
i love the bay just like i love l.a
venice beach and palm springs
summertime is everything
homeboys banging out
all that ass hanging out
bikinis, zucchinis, martinis, no weenies
just the king and a queenie
katy, my lady (yeah?)
lookie here, baby (uh-huh)
i'm all up on ya
'cause you representin' california


california girls, we're unforgettable
daisy dukes, bikinis on top
sun-kissed skin so hot, we'll melt your popsicle
oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh (come on)
california girls, we're undeniable
fine, fresh, fierce, we got it on lock
west coast represent, now put your hands up
oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
