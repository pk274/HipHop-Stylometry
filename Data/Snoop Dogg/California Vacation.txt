check game, i'ma show you how to bang
"uncle snoopy, is it true you from that 20 gang?"
all the time neph', i gotta let my nuts hang
a chest full of chains, left hand with a pinky ring
i'm in a steeler cap, swisher sweet, peel 'em back
my lil' hoodrat, baby got that mini mac
baby got that twenty sack, baby got plenty that
whatever you send us, my nucca, we gon' send it back
i'm in the club with the snub, gettin' love
with twenty thousand crips and twenty thousand bloods
and we don't give a fuck about none of y'all
and when you hit the city, you better holla' at the bigg dogg
i done seen niggas hit l.a. and get they chain snatched
then they call me up beggin' me to get they chain back
what i look like, the motherfuckin' police?
there's certain rules you got to follow when you in these streets
especially when it comes to this cali shit
and i ain't talkin' bout hangin' in the valley bitch
gangbang niggas all up in the alley, crip
on some real talk, nigga we the real ones (west coast)
