shootin' niggas down, slappin' bitches up
straight cash strut with some henny in my cup
rude for the hell of it, i should be the president
aye yo homey, doggy dogg got the medicine
(where, where?) in the cabinet, i'm the magnet
of attracting the baddest bitches on the planet, dig it (dig it, dig it)
i once was a pup, neva scared to run up
i did it 'til the day i came up
and stars do shine, i take my 32 lines and try to make you unwind
first i, chop 'em and den some, flop 'em then flip 'em
break 'em and bend 'em, then fix 'em
convince 'em to buy my records, cause you know it's all hits
spread the word cause you know it's the shit!
quit playin', go get it, quit hesitatin'
it's the young and the big on tha real my nig'
