heavenly father
give power to me
over temptation
in my hour of need
say i'm not forsaken
shower over me
all of your patience
my stone ain't ready



let him chisel away away away
let him chisel away away away
let him chisel away away away
please believe
he's workin on me
he's workin on me
jesus



let him chisel away away away
let him chisel away away away
let him chisel away away away
please believe
he's workin on me
keep workin on me
jesus
