*gunshots*
black folks can't never have no fun!


have a look outside and take a stroll with me
california lifestyle, you wanna roll with me?
i could take you in and out and where it's gonna be
now as crazy as it is, you know this home for me
i wouldn't never leave it, you know that's wrong to me
i'ma stay down, you see me on the corners, g
at your local liquor store, gettin' some optimos
and if i'm out of bounds then i gotta cock the fo'
keep it on the low on the w-w-w-west coast
sign some autographs and then i do get ghost
a-humph.. yeah, i love my folks
but half of y'all fools is cutthroats
on the real know the streets'll have you
guide you, lead you, mislead you, it's fragile
yeah, see you gradually grow
and when you walkin on my side i think you all need to know...


on the 110 freeway flow, back to the block
in the seven deuce coupe, hoppin' hippin' the hop
sippin on some hen' with my nephew infrared
young pimp on the grind tryna line up some head
had fun, did, done, on the west we run
don't matter where you from, if you old or young
seesaw we raw like ooh-la-la
fuck the law, we don't get caught, we just do-da-da
yeah nigga we shakin' the cops
you niggas out there just be makin' it hot
but don't trip if you fakin' a lot
i'll break you, shake you, and take yo' spot
'cause if you think that you gon' slip through california
without gettin banged on.. brother you're wrong
