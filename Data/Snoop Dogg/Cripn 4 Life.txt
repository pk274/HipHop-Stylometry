i'm up early at the crack of dawn, movin' like a mackathon
uncle snoop in the coupe, regroup stoop bag up on
bad bitch twistin' my locks, jack in the box
do it major, slang my flavor as i stayed on the block


sky walk in the everglades, cuz, i'm forever paid
cut from a different cloth, i guess i'm a renegade
drinkin' crip juice with a splash of some lemonade
we on daytons and we skatin' like a icecapade


used to run, now i walk, all the cases i done fought
all the bud that i done bought, and all the bitches that they thought
that they could get a piece of my establishment
looky here bitch, i ain't havin' it


it's like a, action flick, with the mackin' pimp
the rap i spit will hit you like a tag and split
bag the fit, blue rag, sag for this
you mad as shit, my nigga east bagged ya bitch


got blue diamonds, blue hoodies, feel like i could never crip enough
unc' put on for years, who am i to fuck tradition up?
don't even trip nephew, just clean the kitchen up
and keep it crip'n for life, never switchin' up, (never) yeah


real talk (real talk)
from dogg pound to uptown
real shit (real shit)
you can't spell west without the es
you know what it is (you know what it is)
real hustlers, real crip'n (real crip'n)
shout out to my nigga mars
myguy, for hookin' up this motherfuckin' beat
yo east, i told you when you hit the motherfuckin'
lax, touch down, nigga
'cause i got that bubblegum
that real shit, that real crip shit
you what i'm talkin' 'bout
that hubba bubba, that blue bubblegum, cuz
you can't get it no where but here, for real though
have a little bit of that crip juice, with a splash of lemonade
and a bubblegum backwood, and you gon' be aight
you understand me, yeah, east
