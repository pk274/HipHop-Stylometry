a dream of mine i seem to find
grapes make wine, but it takes time
a diamond shine, that's how you define
baby, i'll be back for more
ain't no turnin' back, ain't no lookin' back
it's the d-o-double g with mjb


think 'bout this life i'm livin'
one hell of a feelin'
i'm so glad i listened
got my game, i'm on a mission
i'm evolvin', problem-solvin', livin' that diamond life (life)
i'm evolvin', problem-solvin', livin' that diamond life


i'm living my diamond life (livin' that diamond life)
oh, i'm livin', i'm livin' my diamond life, my diamond life
(livin' that diamond life)
oh, i'm livin'â€“
