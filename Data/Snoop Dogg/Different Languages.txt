visualize like as i do
all i want to do is like be inside you
ride you, try to find you, fill you, revive you
go on with your bad self baby baby cause i do adore
and i give you more
put it on you all the time you know mi amor
we got for sure pure, i'll even allure
don't trip i ain't leaving you for
jay got beyonce, i got shante
with no entree, that's my baby
you know the thing about when i bring 'em out
feels so good i had to sing about
get it, get it now, we flying out of town, checking in a suite
pedicure on my feet
miss bow wow, queen of the town
aiyyo jaz, tell 'em how i put it down




is it the way you look? is it the way you walk?
is it the way you cook? is it the way you talk?
i think it's all of the above
no playtime in the daytime making love
kids go to school, we can act a fool
skinny dip in the pool, do it real smooth
miss bow wow, queen of the town
aiyyo jaz, tell 'em how i put it down

he's here to stay, he's here to stay
ladies, if your man make you say
(got me speaking different languages )
he's here to stay, he's here to stay


uhh, oh yes i am
this my plan, you my girl, i'm your man
take your pain, take my hand, take my name
make my kids, do your thing
ain't no game, show no shame
if i'm the boss, boss lady must be your name
so i got you, got 212
put your face on my back, brand new tattoo
20 years in the game, what love won't do
a lot of women want me but i want you
you look cute when you smile, so i renewed our vows
nowadays i ain't moving that wow, i changed my style
it might happen to you
what gotten to me, shit i gotten to you
and start rapping 'bout things like love and being true
now maybe we can make another baby or two
