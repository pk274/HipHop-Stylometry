i step off the plane, spit my game
so sweet and sticky like candy cane
one night with the boss
fuck what it costs, ima show you how we do in the land of the lost

it’s doggy d-o, like ne-yo
so sick of l-o-v-e s-o-n-g
roll more diesel, move through europe like a pizzo
fuck with my fizzle
you know i always take care of ya
last seen in bulgaria
all up in the club with lilana
trying to start the party
big sha get them gearos at more zeroes
big snoop dogg get your hero
it’s plain to see, that the thing to be is your
fantasy
so don’t blink

(lilana) heeeyy
