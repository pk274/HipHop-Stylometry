from the lbc shore, wheels up on the g4
louis bag with the gucci loafs, silk shirt with a mink coat
flying in, selling game to all you hoes and you're buying in
legend in your presence, hiding
got a room full of bitches and they lying there
high in there, ain't no fire, but a lot of wine in there
they get it, ain't no wifi
on the low, close the door, bitch, i spy
see when i pull up, jump in, we slip out
roll up, roll out, get mines, dip out
she had to come and give a real crip a taste
out of pocket, never that stayin' in stripper's place
big brown ass with some fat titties
and baby make magic when i'm in the city
