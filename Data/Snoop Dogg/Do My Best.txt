i'm talkin' fresh fest (fresh fest), summer jam (summer jam)
day in the west (west coast), with all my fans (yeah)
i was there (yes sir), steeler gear
representin', two braids in my hair
live in the flesh, what you lookin' for?
west-less? nah, nah, westmore
we got cali movin', l.a. to the bay connect
we a hater's threat, but they ain't made it yet
california women, palm tree pimpin'
i represent the hood where nigga's always trippin' (long beach, nigga)
shit talking, crip walking in the summertime
dubs in the air, bangin' in the sunshine
