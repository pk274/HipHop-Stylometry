your way from norway to cali
this is how we play, you say ey, ey, ey
d-o-dub get big love atomic dog
when i come through i gang bang on all ya'll
blue rag in my pocket, green leaves in my lungs now
i'm buzz now floating, coasting, just left roasting
glass is toasting, ocean
slow motion, speed it up
baby want me to come and beat it up
why must i chase the cat
cause i'm a west coast gangsta mack
tha-ra-ra-ra-that
you can trust and we don't fuss
we take our time to make it up and break it up
and put it in a blunt wrap
ralph myerz make the beat that bump like that
