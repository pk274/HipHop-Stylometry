dogg, pound, gangsta, nigga
nate dogg, d-o-double g... ha ha, '98
check this out y'all
for all the gangstas out there


all i know and all i do is
d-p-g with the rest of my crew
we through with milken milli vanilli
silly niggas who be rappin' but they really be actin'
i'm smackin' niggas in they face for the '9-8
my dj warren g and my homeboy nate
the game won't wait, so we paper chase
and watch out for them suckas who paper hate
try to drop some shit to keep ya straight
i keep my niggas on a mission and the suckas keep wishin'
but my success, oh yes it's fresh
here's a toast to the eastside, l.b. for lizie
you can call me what you wanna
or you can catch me in the navigator bendin' a corner
i'm representin', just like billy clinton
i smack a bitch and make my chips, then dip
