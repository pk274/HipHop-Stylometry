it's like everywhere i lizzook and everywhere i go
i'm hearin' somebody tryna steal my flow
but it ain't no thang, 'cause, see, my homie coolio
put me up on the game when i stepped through the door
you know some of these fools are so deceptive
using my styles like a contraceptive
i hope you get burnt, seems you haven't learnt
it's the knick-knack, patty-wack
i still got the biggest sack
so put your gun away, run away, 'cause i'm back (why?)
hit 'em up, get 'em up, spit 'em up (now)
tell me, what's going on?
it make me wanna holler, 'cause my dollars come in o-zones
known for the break off, shake off, now take off your clothes
and quit tryin' to spit at my hoes
speakin' of hoes, i'll get to the point
you think you got the bomb 'cause i rolled you a joint?
you'se a flea, and i'm the big dogg
i'll scratch you off my balls with my paws, alls
y'alls bustas better recognize (uh-huh)
and see where i'm coming from: it's still eastside
'til i die - why ask why?
as the world keeps spinning to the d-o-double g-y
