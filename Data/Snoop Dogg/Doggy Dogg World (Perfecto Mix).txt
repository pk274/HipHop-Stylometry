it's like everywhere i lizzook and everywhere i go
i'm hearin' somebody tryna steal my flow
but it ain't no thang, 'cause, see, my homie coolio
put me up on the game when i stepped through the door
you know some of these fools are so deceptive
using my styles like a contraceptive
i hope you get burnt, seems you haven't learnt
it's the knick-knack, patty-wack
i still got the biggest sack
so put your gun away, run away, 'cause i'm back (why?)
hit 'em up, get 'еm up, spit 'em up (now)
tell me, what's going on?
it makе me wanna holler, 'cause my dollars come in o-zones
known for the break off, shake off, now take off your clothes
and quit tryin' to spit at my hoes
speakin' of hoes, i'll get to the point
you think you got the bomb 'cause i rolled you a joint?
you'se a flea, and i'm the big dogg
i'll scratch you off my balls with my paws, alls
y'alls bustas better recognize (uh-huh)
and see where i'm coming from: it's still eastside
'til i die. why ask why?
as the world keeps spinning to the d-o-double g-y


ayy, well if you show me ten freaks, i'll run up in all ten
seen the homie snoop dogg sippin' juice and gin
don't slip, i'm for the set-trip to get papers
styles vary, packin' flavor like lifesavers
ain't that somethin'? you keep talkin' and i'm dumpin' (blaow)
i had the fool whole block bumpin'
don't sweat, but check the technique, i'm unique like china
you'll never find a bomber rhymer than this dogg behind ya
so peek-a-boo, clear the way, i'm comin' through
one, two, three, you can't see me
i'm a g like that, strapped with hit-hard tactics
a menace, and i'm usin' 'em like tennis rackets
it's on again, it's on and poppin'
all i see is green, so there ain't no stoppin'
i wanna see some panties droppin'
i'm coming from l.a
she used to chill with dre up in compton


all i ever could do was use that ho
chill in my dickies, get riches, and kick flows
i promise we smoke chronic 'til the day that we die
ba ba ba ba ba ba, it's a doggy doggy's world
(it's your world) the dogg's world (it's your world)
tha dogg pound rocks the party (all night long)
'til when? ('til the early morn')
it don't stop (and uh), it don't quit
(for the) tha dogg pound clique (to drop the cavi dope shit)
