it's like everywhere i look and everywhere i go
i'm hearing motherfuckers tryna steal my flow
but it ain't no thang, 'cause, see, my nigga coolio
put me up on the game when i stepped through the door
you know, some of these niggas is so deceptive
using my styles like a contraceptive
i hope you get burnt
seems you haven't learnt
it's the knick-knack, patty-wack
i still got the biggest sack
so put your gun away, run away, 'cause i'm back (why?)
hit em up, get 'em up, spit 'em up (now)
tell me, what's going on?
it make me wanna holler, 'cause my dollars come in o-zones
known for break off so take off your clothes
and quit trying to spit at my motherfuckin' hoes
speaking of hoes, i'll get to the point
you think you got the bomb 'cause i rolled you a joint?
you'se a flea, and i'm the big dogg
i'll scratch you off my balls with my motherfuckin' paws
y'alls niggas better recognize (uh-huh)
and see where i'm coming from: it's still eastside
til i die. why ask why?
as the world keeps spinning to the d-o-double g, y


well, if you give me ten bitches then i'll fuck all ten
seen the homie snoop doggy sippin' juice and gin
don't slip, i'm for the set-trip to get papers
styles vary, packin' flavor like lifesavers
ain't that somethin'? talk shit and i'm dumpin' (blaow)
i had your whole fuckin' block bumpin'
don't sweat, but check the technique, i'm unique like china
you'll never find a bomber rhymer than this nigga behind ya
so peek-a-boo, clear the way, i'm comin' through
one, two, three, you can't see me
i'm a g like that, strapped with hit-hard tactics
a fuckin' menace using hoes like tennis rackets
it's on again, it's on and poppin'
all i see is green, so there ain't no stoppin'
i wanna see some panties droppin'
i'm coming from l.a
she used to chill with dre up in compton
all i ever did was just use that ho
chill in my dickies, get riches, and kick flows
i’m dishin' out blues, i'm upsettin' like bad news
cut off khakis, french braids, and house shoes
kurupt's the name, so i'm also catchin' slugs
and i smoke weed for the fuck of it
rough and rugged shit, it’s unexplanatory how i gets wicked
but it’s mandatory that i kick it
check it, i’m runnin' hoes in '94, now must i prove it
hoes call me sugar ray for the way i be stickin' and movin'
prepare for a war, it’s on, i'm head huntin'
hit the button, and light shit up like red dawn
peep the massacre from a verbal assassin
murderin' with rhymes packin' tec-9's for some action
you really don't know, do you? you fuckin' wit' a hog
you can't do me, i'm goin' out looney like o-dog
