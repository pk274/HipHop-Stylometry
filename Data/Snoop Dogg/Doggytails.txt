hey snoop dogg, can you give us a bedtime story?
alright, hand me my backwoods, here we go


just another day in me old neighborhood
not bad meanin' bad but bad meanin' good
time flies by with the boomin' system
shot for my head, i popped back but i missed 'em
so i kept shootin' 'til i ran outta shots
then i threw my gun at him and i ran up the block
swang them foes, bang them hoes
20 minutes later, i changed them clothes
for a disguise, east side niggas is back
ain't heard your new shit 'cause you niggas is whack
i came to this party all by myself
but i won't leave by myself
i got his, hers and your bitch too
they all come through, it's sorta like a rendezvous
i'm so true to this shit, never new to this shit
kick back and watch your big homie do this shit


1 little 2, little 3, little gs
hangin' by the high school, blowin' in the trees
4 little, 5 little, 6 tcs
watch a nigga back when i'm dip in through the es
7 little, 8 little, 9 little hoes
wanna kick it, i suppose, gettin' tickets to my shows
10 to 11 but a dozen on the rose
gave that bitch to my cousin 'cause he hard on the nose
hey, you know how shit goes, make that bitch strike a pose
she belong to the gang, so you know that bitch chose
so cold, make a nigga freeze up, hoes down, nigga, g's up


i did a whole lotta gutta shit
but lookin' back at it, young loc, cuz, i'm on some other shit
intellectual, misdirectional
correct yourself so you can avoid correctional facilities
mental stability, validity
everythin' you look at ain't what it appear to be
compellin' you, sellin' you, i'm tellin' you this
see poppin' this shit is like knockin' a bitch
i'm cold with it, rock roll with it, trick hoes with it
nick foles with it, get it, i be the backup, second in line
see when i get in, you ain't gettin' no more time
i'm free as a bird, c is the word, nigga, i did that, nigga
never switchin' up, my nigga, let's get this shit back
true to this shit, never new to this shit
kick back and watch your big homie do this shit
