hmm, money is flowing everything is fine
i bought my self and uzi and my brother a nine
business is booming everything is cool
i pull about a g a week, fuck school
a year passed by and i began to grow
not in height but juice and cash flow
i kick up my feet to watch some t.v
cause now i got other people working for me
i got a 55" television you know
and every once in a while i hear "just say no"
or the other commercial i love
that's when they say this is you brain on drugs
i pick up the remote control and just turn
cause with this bullshit i'm not concerned
me and my brother bounced in the benz
we driving around our territory again
i pull up at the light like a superstar
an automatic weapon cold sprayed my car
i hit the accelerator scared as shit
i drove one block to find my brother was hit
he wasn't dead but the blood was pouring
and all i could think about was warren
later i found it was dogg and his crew
now tell me what the fuck am i suppose to do

my brother is out of it but i'm still in it
on top of that i'm in it to win it
i can't believe that dogg would dis me
that faggot that punk he soft or sissy
i driving around with three of my guys
the war is on and i'm on the rise
we rolled right up to dogg's favorite hang out
what's cracking dogg and let the bullets stang out
someone shot back so we took cover
and all i could about was my brother
dogg jumped up and began to run
bustin shots hoping to hit someone
so i just stopped and let off three shot
two hit that nigga and one hit a cop
i threw down the gun and began to shout
"ay y'all all lets break out got 'em dip out
now as i left there goes the boys in blue
they pointin they guns at my four man crew
they shot down one, they shot down two
now tell me what the fuck am i suppose to do
