pullin' and grabbin' you
rattlesnakin' and stabbin' you
things you wouldn't imagine
simply because you like havin' people
talkin' about you but you can't pay no attention
they say, that's how it is
even when you be livin' presidential
they always funkin' with you
especially when you go official
take it from me, a gc
'cause people are so fictitial
sticks and stones do break bones
and talk make the weak fall off
while the strong keep keepin' on


oh yeah, just another dog day afternoon, baby
have you ever been on a trip
and found out that you was from another time, baby
where unconditional love takes root
and our intelligence is absolutely color-blind, baby
(don't you let 'em, don't let 'em)
twinkle, twinkle little star
you got your hands up in my cookie jar (don't let'em)
don't doubt it, don't doubt it
don't talk about it, be 'bout it
don't doubt it, don't doubt it
don't talk about it, be 'bout it
(don't let them put you down)
tell 'em what we talkin' bout, snoop
see, i was once told that
to be talked about was one of the greatest forms of flattery
and i'm flattered that you're talkin' about me (yeah)
for you to talk about me
is something fun to do, baby
yeah you keep doin' what you do
'cause i'm definitely gon' keep doin' what i do
don't doubt it, don't doubt it
i'm not gon' talk about it, i'm gon' be about it
can you dig it? (yeah)
i don't know nothin' but to do it (do it, baby)
nothin' to it but to do it
and i'ma do it with the do-it-fluid, baby, can you dig it? (i can dig it!)

the people's choice there you have it
the most valuable players, baby
(don't let 'em)

(don't let 'em)
