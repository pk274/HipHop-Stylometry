bitch, i know you ain't in love with me
if it wasn't for my doggystyle, you wouldn't even fuck with me
cut her off, ain't nothin' to a g
seen that punk bitch from across the street
see, i don't mean to be disrespectful
but if you come with some bullshit, i'ma check you
straight, get you right, and if you don't, i left you
sittin' in the dust, 'cause i never could trust 'em
all about the paper, there's no discussion
cup full of indigo, good kush, i'm crushin'
she a ride or die bitch, that means no question
go rounds, back to back, like we both wrestlin'
girl, you know where i'm from, and you know where i'm steppin'
blessed with all styles of the game, so i'm destined
to bust moves, dogg pound's what i'm reppin'
if you're not givin' top, get the fuck out my section


don't hit my line up
hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey
'cause i'm high (yessir)
don't hit my line up
hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey
'cause i'm high
