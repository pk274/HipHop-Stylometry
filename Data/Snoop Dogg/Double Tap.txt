which one of ya'll wanna dip with a crip?
take a trip to a place where the weather win
rollin' up a seven and
take you where you never been
hen and gin with a little bit of medicine
this that shit so heavy
double tap with the rap, baby, so ready
livin' in the south
backyard, big house
three or four cars, but she need a little d in her life
and g in her life
so i'm-a hit her with the business
finzel, can a nigga get a witness?
touch the screen two times for the set
i'll put you on the bed to the jet to get you wet
computer love, i know you want that lunar love
fuck with me on the low and i'm-a do you up
the coolest crip niggas, baby, we them
smokin' up, open up, i slide up in your dms
