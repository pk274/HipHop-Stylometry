ooh-wee, baby
you smell that? now, that's funky
oh, you say you do? i think you don't
you will? no, you won't (oh)
thank god for social media
hieroglyphically, scientifically speaking
i don't know you, but you know me
see, they call us drones (ooh-wee)
she know how to ride the way i like
grips me python tight
until i fold
