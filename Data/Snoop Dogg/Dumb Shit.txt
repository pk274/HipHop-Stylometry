oh naw, big snoop dogg
party all night and we like blowing them bombs
suit game gucci, steak at the palm
cootchie lootchie, black tie, bring me them all
what it is, what it do, snopp do dub?
is there any way that you can get us in the club?
girl i'm buzzin' with a cousin and a set of twins
diggin', duggin, shit here i go again
it's certain mo'fuckers that i run with
that keep me on some bobby shmurda dumb shit
i'm creepin' while you sleepin' but you woke up
speak up, spoke up, make a nigga choke up
so right, so wrong, so what?
if we break up, i'm the one that's broke up
picking and choosing, that lil' bitch with we
i woke up in the morning on tmz, ooh wee
