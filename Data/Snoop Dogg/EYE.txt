with a whole new routine to go
i can’t seem to figure out, dig her out
back talk, cat walk, a nigga out

we in it to win it, let's work this shit out
you got the key, my love is a house
we fight and we fuss, but we can't live without
i done lied and i done tried
and time won't pass me by, so i (i)
figured i’ma be the bigger man on this
kaytranada, i ain't really plan on this
i stand on this, ten toes in the dirt
half a century, feel the pimp in me


i know you can (i know you can)
don't nobody gotta tell you once again (never gotta tell you twice)
i (i) know you can (i know it, i know it)
don't nobody gotta tell your ass again (now listen here)
