it's like everywhere i look and everywhere i go
i'm hearing muthafuckas tryna steal my flow
but it ain't no thang, cause see my nigga coolio
put me up on the game when i stepped in the door
you know some of you niggas is so deceptive
using my styles like a contraceptive
i hope you get burnt
seems you haven't learnt
it's the knick-knack, patty-whack
i still got the biggest sack!
so put your gun away, run away, cause i'm back
why? hit em up, get 'em up, spit 'em up
now, tell me, what's going on?
it make me wanna holler, cause my bitches come in o-zones
known for break off so take off your clothes
and quit trying to spit at my motherfuckin' hoes!
speaking of hoes, i kick in the doors
put my nuts on ya chin and the story goes


why do bitch-ass niggas always talk shit
but don't when it's time to get wrecked, checked, and ripped?
i knew he was a hoe
ready to turn a trick and i can tell from his lips that my dick would fit
i've split, gums
you didn't know dumb-da-ditty-dumb
and my shit do harm so run, ring the alarm
i thought you knew i'm looney like tony montana
in the mix running shit, oops and um...
the smoothest, coolest, rudest ya know
on a kamikaze mission (ooh, if i can be like snoop)
keep wishing, listen
with my balls in ya jaws, make room to put my dick in
