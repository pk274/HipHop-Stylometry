aw, bow wizzle, i love your braids. i wish my hair could grow like that!
thanks! but if you had braids we wouldn’t be able to see those big, awesome ears of yours!
that’s right, we’re all different and that’s what makes us special


differences make you unique
the way you look or how you speak
if everybody was all just the same
it’d be so boring, tiresome and lame
different makes the world go ‘round
you should wear your differences loud and proud
believe in yourself and trust in what you see
you just be you, i’ll just be me
