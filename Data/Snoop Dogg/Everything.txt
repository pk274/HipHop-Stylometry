you and your niece, me and jacquees
we can make love in between them sheets
all you can eat on me, it's a feast
have fun wit' me while i run these streets
so sweet, so rough, so tough, so bad
get whatchu want, throw it in the bag
stayed down wit' me even when i did wrong
that's probably why i'm singin' this song
a boss hit, a boss lady, that's you
put your face on my right arm, tattoo
met you, gotchu, get you
you're my angel, god bless you
who am i in love with? just you
float on the boat, just us two
smokin' and strokin', just us two
this is splendid, flex it and bend it
lay it out for ya
now let me play it out for ya
you get what she won't 'cause she don't compare
you get what you want 'cause you have been there for me
carefully, prepared to lay down your life for me
my life would be nothin' wit' outchu
and i ain't doin' nothin' wit' outchu
