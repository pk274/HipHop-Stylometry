sippin’ yac while i elevate my mind state
hand by the burner in case a nigga try to violate
never going down, stay rising like andre
cause my corner back every thing the don say
long beach, yeah i yell it out in every song
err’y day, err’y night till i’m carried home
forever known, big ballin’, try it in the city
then yelling out swish way before it in the net
and i ain't knocking a niggas hustle, it’s all a game
and when they mention the best, will they call your name?
there's only winners and losers, ain't no in between
you either hit the hall of fame or you fall to shame
and you ain't got to wonder where my place at
pepsi blue rags sorta poppin, bitch taste that
one hit of the bong will blow ya face back
lmfao to the bank, boy, asap


i do it cause i feel it
live it like i’m talkin’
flow so straight but won't a nigga try and walk in it
i’m so high, yeah the weed, i’m still sparking it
my bitch bad and my diamonds still sparkling
got the competition shaking like parkinsons
bread's in the bag, call it good marketing
life’s a bitch but i don’t cartigan
thats what a word to the third letter
shots, shots, shots to me and my cheddar
run these emcee’s i’m tougher than leather
vietnemese eyes tighter than ever
fuck with the dogg i’m biting whomever
cause i don came from a long path
only god knows how long the dogg has
cause like time we all pass
so if you ever taste success, just pray it’s from a tall glass
