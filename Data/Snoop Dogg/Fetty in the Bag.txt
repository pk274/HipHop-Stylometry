(amplified)


from the isley brothers to the jackson 5
a nigga give it to you on the black hand side
collide and glide 'til we amplified
and do it all together, electric slide
it got good to you (good to you), now you feelin' the vibe
in the chevy, rollin', ready to ride
hand out the moon, heavy on the gas
steady on the mash, now put the fetty in the bag


it's a stick-up, i get to the money with no hiccups
give two fucks, no goof-ups
no back-ups, no swoop-ups (nope)
get stomped out in some motherfuckin' blue chucks
yeah, nigga, i'm back
in a 9-4 cadillac, playin' zapp with fifteens in the back
stash thе strap strap then adjust my snapback
salt and pepper, bеans and rice
ebony and ivory, domino, dice
twice as nice, never payin' the price
bakin' a cake, have a slice
mustard and mayonnaise, leather and wood (ooh wee)
take it from the rich, givin' back to the hood
you know how we do's it
robbed his ass and rode off to some gangsta music
