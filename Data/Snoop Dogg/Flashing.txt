hot shit, from the city of big lights
where ever you look out it's a star
with their cellphones out, doin' bid'ness by the bar
they bein' (flashing!) that shit that have you on the island
with money in the bank and you riding a real stallion
now you flying to venice, for italian
and you ain't goin' home until you blow a hundred thousand
(flashing!) boss dogg baby, on that patron
long as you're riding with me, the party is on
look at how they shake it when they know their daddy at home
(flashing!) so many models, so much love
ridin' with the boss doggy, so many drugs
in the air, it's gettin' foggy, we at the club
smokin' in the back, everybody gettin' bust
stayin' (flashing!) ya, here it is
westside get yo ass up (move that shit!)
eastside get yo ass up (push, flashing!)
