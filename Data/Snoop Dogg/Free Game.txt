telemarketing, telecommunications
tell a nigga snoop dogg back with favorite nations
gettin' money out your favorite television stations
relevant, selling shit, i'm up in the matrix
it's basic how i move with persistence, but patient
i'm slidin' through the city in a spaceship
evasive, that bay shit knock (knock)
from the streets to the suites, from the trunk to the block
llc, then we signed on the dot
control the plot, and all the money in our pot
it's a new way of thinkin'
black-owned, backbone, black bankin'
real estatin', elevatin', educatin'
money-makin', motivatin', no doubt
we about free game
from the dogg and it's on the house (free game, yes sir)
