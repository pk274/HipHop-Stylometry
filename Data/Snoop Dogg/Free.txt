i've been in this game so long 'cause my game so long
got them suckers off my timeline, i waved so long
savin' money my whole lifetime if things go wrong
keep my heater close to me until the danger gone
danger zone is where i'm from, bangin' on them 2-1
eastside resident with a gift so heaven-sent
uplift my prevalence, i leave no evidence
blue chucks on the fence is the last you see
no master degree but i mastered the degree and made shit for me
i hustle for my paper and i do that accurately
rap to the beat like mozart, i'm classic on tracks
matter of fact, i'm the modern day hathaway
i don't play, get out the way, i was your favorite back in the day
still the flavor to this moment in time, fuckin' the game
money and fame, my focus on mine to keep it in range
severed the ties of people complainin', i'm back on the rise
