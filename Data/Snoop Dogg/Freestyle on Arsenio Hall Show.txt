it's like this, yeah, and it don't stop
now stand up on ya feet and peep the beats
snoop doggy dogg's on the mic i'd like to speak, preach
to each and all, i don't stall
y'all know who the dopest rapper is his name is doggy dogg
i freak and speak and preach to you
cos' i'm on the microphone sportin' grey and blue
i'm true to what i do, i don't bang at all
i'm the smooth macadamia. snoop doggy dogg, i
make you jump, pump, pump, grab your gat but you might find yourself slump, hump
you can't see me, you wanna' be me
i got a message to the cpt- wassup' eazy?
i'm getting kind of greasy with curl on your neck
you can't see the dogg 'cos i'm out to chin check
they call me the super-duper, superb
hit 'em up, get 'em up, spit 'em up, word
