yo yo yo, what's up nate dogg?
niggas just chillin' here with the homie warren g
(friends, how many of us have them?)
reminiscin' on some real friendship man
a lotta kids don't know what that word means
(friends, how many of us have them?)
homeboys, ya know what i'm sayin', misusin' their words
fuck a homie, i'm lookin' for a friend
(friends, how many of us have them?)
that's what i'm 'bout
(friends, how many of us have them?)
uh
how y'all doin'?


ever since i could remember, i had friends i could depend on
clothes to lend 'em, money to spend on
but as time went by my life got a little strange
and the rules in this game seem to change
trust, honesty, and devotion
and money, money, money is the poison potion
there's no way that i can even say
that this game has been good to me, or even bad to me
it had to be 'cause tragically the way this shit
cracked off for doggy dogg was magically
and now i'm gettin' everything i'm supposed to get
but my friendship with niggas always ends up as bullshit
i listen to my momma though (my momma though)
she always tried to prepare me and warn me for the drama, love
but how could she do what i? i mean i'm do or die
but my life on the streets, that shit is suicide
so to cope i got a dogg and a locc
and keep my heat close in case these jokes go for broke
i'm mashin' with the clique 2-1-3 that is (that's right, that's right)
they my homeboys ever since kids, real friends to the end
