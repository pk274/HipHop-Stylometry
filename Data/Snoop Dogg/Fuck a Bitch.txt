i fall off into a party with a drink in my hand
rocawear pants, but i ain't come here to dance
by any chance, has anybody seen dj clue?
tell him i'm lookin' for him (what's yo' name?) big snoop
i'm in the big coupe, i got that whoop whoop
i'm tryin' to get a chicken, i got that big loot
let me slide to the hoop, regroup, and come through
i'll bag it up, and serve you and you too
i throw strikes like andy pettitte and roger clemens
pitch a shut-out, the whole 9 innings
the bulletproof 'lac with the windows tinted?
you mean the one with the pretty bitches sittin in it?
please believe it, we gon' represent it
and we gon' bend it and dent it
fuck what it cost, we gon' spend it
buy it, never rent it
now when you suckin my dick, baby girl put yo' face in it
get it get it girl (get it girl), make yo' head swirl
get it get it (get it girl), make my toes curl
and get it get it, go on girl, it's a crazy mixed up doggy dogg world


and i know that you really can't believe what ya hear and ya see
just put ya hands up and repeat after me
get yo' money, fuck a bitch...and blow a gang of weed
and i know that you probably never thought that you could see a true g
a nigga like the d-o-double gizzy
but like i said, get yo' money, fuck a bitch, and blow a gang of weed
