i'm a beretta, a go-getter
mo' wetter loretta, dope-getter
so better for weather, no never
so clever, go whether or not the teapot or the beef might settle
feet on the pedal, mashin' music
blastin', swervin', drivin' fast
in the wrong lane
but i ain't tripping 'cause i'm getting my cash in
motherfuckers want to lock me up
'cause i gang-bang, smoke weed, don't give a fuck
i bought my lil football team a bus
on the grind trynna find time, lettin' rеal niggas shine
figaro on the low, let thеse niggas know
boss dogg, boss paw, just to let 'em know
when i came through the door, i bang with the four
motherfucker, i'ma bang with the o
i'm the crippin' kitchen, spitting at bitches
flippin' the switches, my niggas in richmond
the real killers, guerillas
wig splitters, heavy hitters, ya dig it?
now trip, a lot of niggas like to say what they gon' do
but i'ma fuck with y'all, cuh, 'cause i want to
a lot of people say it's bad for my health
but i don't give a fuck 'cause i'm a match for myself

 (x2)
i stay fuckin' with y'all, i stay fuckin' with y'all
a lot of people say it's bad for my health
but myself, i stay fuckin' with y'all

 (x2)
i stay fuckin' with y'all, i stay fuckin' with y'all
a lot of people say it's bad for my health
but myself, i stay fuckin' with y'all

 (x2)
i stay fuckin' with y'all, i stay fuckin' with y'all
a lot of people say it's bad for my health
but myself, i stay fuckin' with y'all
