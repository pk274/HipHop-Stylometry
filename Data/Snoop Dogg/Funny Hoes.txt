one bad bitch tried to set me up
get me up, out of my hood
you got back, shot that, told that batch
talk if she want some doggy dick you gotta come get that
won’t be got bitch, i think not
besides, i got homies posted on the 9-8 block
my credentials be potentially leaving my footprints
chief of executive but stay on that hood shit
cut more … than the new mark fader
take some now, save some for later
a deed is free mind or some mory green gator
fella shippin with the bishop, yea he made it
celebratin, enterprising, merchandising, self-sufficing
but uncompromising
for what it’s worth, i’m down to earth
feel more slim, this the rebirth on the illegal
for really though, feel me though

for really though
and i’mma always stand tall like a gangsta
i’ll take you to money, i ain’t fuckin with them funny hoes
ball like a gangsta
(fuckin with the funny hoes)
and i’mma always stand tall like a gangsta
i’ll take you to money, i ain’t fuckin with them funny hoes
