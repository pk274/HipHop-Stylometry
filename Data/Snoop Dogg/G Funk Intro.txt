i'm sippin' on tanqueray
with my mind on my money and my mouth fulla' gan-jay
r-a-g to the motherfuckin' e
back with my nigga s-n-double-o-p
yeah, and ya don't stop
rage in effect, i just begun to rock
i said, yeah, and ya don't quit
hey-yo, rage, would you please drop some gangsta shit?
i rock rough and stuff with my afro puffs
handcuffed as i bust, 'bout to tear shit up
oh, what? did ya think i, didn't ever think i
would be the one to make you blink eye, i'm catchy like pink-eye
never will there ever be another like me, um
you can play the left 'cause it ain't no right in me
out the picture, out the frame, out the box i knock 'em all
smack 'em out the park, like "a friendly game of baseball"
grand slam, yes, i am
kickin' up dust and i don't give a goddamn
'cause i'm that lyrical murderer pleading guilty
you know from my skills i'm about to be
filthy, large, rage in charge
you know what's happenin', don't try to play raj
this ain't no re-run, see, hun, don't you wanna be one?
however, rage'll wreck ya 'cause i'm def
i kick my vocals, i loc yo, coast to coast or local, uh!
i'll make 'em go coo-coo for my cocoa
puffin' stuff, ayo, snoop, you're up
let these niggas know that niggas don't give a fuck


this is just a small introduction to the g-funk era
everyday of my life i take a glimpse in the mirror
and i see motherfuckers tryna be like me
ever since i put it down with the d-r-e
