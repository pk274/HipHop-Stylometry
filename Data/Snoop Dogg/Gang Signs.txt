s-n-double-o, don't forget the p, pimp
a hundred million later and i’m still on that g shit
been all around the world on my lbc shit
213 click, wish nate could see this
recognize game when it's in your face
and when i pull up, all you hear is "everlasting bass"
say what up to my young life, give dap to the g's
kiss some aunties and models that’s happy to see me
snoopy d-o-double, where you been?
on highway 110 doing a hundred and ten
back in the building like i forgot something
mekanix on the beat, you know it knock, cousin
flow dippin' and slidin', crippin' and ridin', sittin' on candy paint
dressin' and finessin', lookin’ like a blessing
making all the hoes faint, the dogg


four-fifteens with thе zap on my lap
riding through the ghetto, all you hear is thе slap
everybody throwing up gang signs (crip)
throwing up gang signs (suwoop)
four-fifteens with the zap on my lap
riding through the ghetto, all you hear is the slap
everybody throwing up gang signs (crip)

crip walking with my homegirl martha
while i'm passing joints to madonna
who wanna smoke with snoop? let's have a smoke or two
puff, puff, pass, that's what real smokers do
you was smokin' on gary payton, i was smokin' with gary payton
we not the same, stop hatin'
triple gold daytons and the walls is white
never made it to the league, but live a baller's life (yeah)
rest in peace kobe and gigi
la ain't been the same since we lost the homie nipsey (neighborhood)
pour out a little liquor for pac
and while you at it, say a prayer for the homie doc
when snoop drop, i make the world go crazy
it still ain't nothin' but a g thang, baby
