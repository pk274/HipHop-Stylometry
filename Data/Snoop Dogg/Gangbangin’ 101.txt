west coast, it's time to stand up nigga
we gon' unite 'round this motherfucker one time
i'm callin' every real crip nigga
and every real b-dogg, to the table right now
yeah, we gon' push a real line right now
see if y'all with this real gangsta guerrilla shit


have you ever seen 100,000 rip riders from the side
blue chuck's, blue rags, grey clouds, blue skies
on the move, can't lose, hill street blues
niggas gotta pay they dues on the crews or with the uzi spray
these suckas then i cruise, my granny saw it on the news
she shook up, look up and then she put me on the move
i tried to get away, but i couldn't get far
'cause the homies had the loop-loop that night at king park
and i got into a squab, got caught and went to jail
straight to the county with no motherfuckin' bail
4800 with this crippin', oh well
my big homie boy blue snatched me by my coattail
he said trip dogg, ya better get right, crip right
eyes open cause niggas get stuck on seez-ight
it ain't no motherfuckin' problem - pop-pop, tick-tock
never flip-flop, 20 crippin' til i drop


ca-rip, ca-rip, ca-rip, ca-rip
su-whoop, su-whoop, su-whoop, su-whoop
ca-rip, ca-rip, ca-rip, ca-rip
su-whoop, su-whoop, su-whoop, su-whoop

su-whoop, su-whoop, su-whoop, su-whoop
ca-rip, ca-rip, ca-rip, ca-rip
su-whoop, su-whoop, su-whoop, su-whoop
ca-rip, ca-rip, ca-rip, ca-rip

(what up blood?) yeah cuz, we just tippin'
me and game doin' thangs, switchin' lanes, hurricanes on my feet
stop, and c-walk to the beat
game, take the wheel and turn on 21st street
eastside lbc, gun in my hand
it's the turf by the surf but we don't play in the sand
we just - slip and slide out, we rip and ride out
let it c known, nigga welcome to the thunderdome


ca-rip, ca-rip, ca-rip, ca-rip
su-whoop, su-whoop, su-whoop, su-whoop
ca-rip, ca-rip, ca-rip, ca-rip
su-whoop, su-whoop, su-whoop, su-whoop
su-whoop, su-whoop, su-whoop, su-whoop
