i ain't ever met another gangsta like you
i ain't really sure but i think i'd like to
give you my number to my cellular phone
play my cards right, will you take me home?
(girl you will never meet a gangsta like me
we can our thing but you can't be wifey
go and let your doggy boy give you a bone
at the end of the night i'll take you home)
