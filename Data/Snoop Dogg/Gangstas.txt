no limit. soldiers. (ughhhhhhhh!)
dpgc. gangstas. (ha, ha!)
look here, you got three crazy muthafuckas
in the same place at the same time
(yeah, master p)
you know this shit gon be off the hook
(it's gon be the wildest shit you ever heard.)
for my bitches down south
southern hospitality
(representin, ya heard me)


from the cold, hard streets of the lbc
to a duet with mystikal and master p
real g's ship keys and shoot dice on their knees
and put pistols to the mouths, of their enemies
old country ass nigga with a gold in the front
be the same muthafucka that get your bitch ass stomped
underestimatin hatin got you knocked out cold
tryin to play my boy over, you was with your ho
them south niggas bangin' off the shit that we write
punk niggas get killed, straight on sight
no limit ain't no gimmick
it's tragic you know, so don't be meddlin with my boy and my ho
lay low, hit the floor, i'm back
yo p, take me to the streets, that's where my heart is at
you make em say ughhhhhhh!
i make em say beeyatch
together we can flip the script and get grip
you got the crack, i got the bud sack
mystikal, smack, you got the strap
deep in that gangsta shit on a night like that
you blast me, i blast you back, beeyatch!
