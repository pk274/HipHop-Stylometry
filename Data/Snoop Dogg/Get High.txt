ay yo nephew
i think it's time to put some of that real sticky-icky-icky in the motherfuckin' air
but in a backwood, ya dig?


with a lot of old money
everybody want somethin' from me
got to keep my hands on the steering wheel
'cause i foot the bill and i shoot to kill
and i slide around in that snoop deville
and my gas tank is on full
stack goods, them backwoods
we cock back and we pull
bubblegum, cookies, og, and kk
we like craig and dae dae, who gives a fuck what they say?
i be out here gettin' it, gotta get it 'cause i got it on
i'm the same nigga that you bitch niggas plotted on
it ain't as easy as i make it look
see what i'm sayin', i ain't playin', nigga take a look
we on that g shit, nigga we lit, and i'm seasick for real
thugger thug, what it does, let's get this motherfuckin' money cuz
i mean that new money, that blue money with new faces
them new cases and new bases and new aces
florida-anapolis, ain't no stoppin' us
power preaches patience
balling in two places
exchanges, smoke faces


see man, a lot of you niggas think you can smoke with us
but umm
this shit is a marathon man
this ain't no motherfuckin' umm, hundred yard dash
man step back
you ain't in our league
thugger thug, doggy dogg
