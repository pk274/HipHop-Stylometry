get up sucka
security, this sucka don't wanna get up to get down
he definitely gotta get off


this funk was produced to make ya trunk hella loose
to tell the truth, ain't nuttin' snoop, poof
we came to invade them braids
khaki suits, stacy boots, wit' grey cascades
great parties, like one time
have everybody ready to get sweaty 'till the sunshine
one nation, overtaken for the bacon
feel the floor, ain't no sankin'
i bang a fool on his chin face
so if he got feedback, ease back then blast
you know the cycle always gotta continue
so stay tuned for the drama i'll send you
f-u-n-k, for those one-hitter quitters, one song on their disc play
you know who i'm talkin' about
you gotta get up to get down or get out
