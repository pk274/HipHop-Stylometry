i try to do right, i don't wanna do wrong
i'm doin' better things, man, i wanna live long
ain't too many fools out there harder than me
i love football so much, man, i started a league
oh, what a pity, it's made for the inner city
it used to be dark but now the park's real pretty
lil' boys outside throwin' footballs
in the hood, y'all
hey, snoop dogg, how could y'all
let 'em pass instead of blast
the football field is a class
and i'ma teach, teach 'em my lesson
shotgun formation, no smith and no wesson
the haters keep stressin'
and everybody wanna ask me the question
hey, boss dogg, how you feel now?
you helpin' out the kids and they still hatin' on ya, wow!
