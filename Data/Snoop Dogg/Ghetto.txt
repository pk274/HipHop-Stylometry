i'm from the shitty city, where niggas is born to die
and if you choose to gangbang then you're sworn to ride
see at a early age, niggas make you choose the sides
it's called survival and only the strong survive
see i can talk you through it, walk you through it, let you see
but i don't really know if you gon' see as g as me
these lifelong lessons, with the street shit
these ghetto politics, cuh that's some deep shit
one nigga made it out, two niggas shot him down
three mamas crying now, all of them lying down
these preachers praying now, and y'all still playing around
twenty five in the game and i'm still staying down
with my ethic and my code which is ghetto
which afforded me to win four medals
and settle down with my wife
ghetto fabulous life
yeah that's right
double me up, i do it twice
nice, that's how we do it my nigga
