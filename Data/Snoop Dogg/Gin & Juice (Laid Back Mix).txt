with so much drama in the lbc
it's kind of hard bein' snoop d-o-double-g
but i, somehow, some way
keep comin' up with funky-ass shit, like, every single day
may i kick a little something for the g's (yeah)
and make a few ends as i breeze through? (yeah)
two in the mornin' and the party's still jumpin'
'cause my mama ain't home
i got bitches in the livin' room gettin' it on
and they ain't leavin' 'til six in the mornin'
(six in the mornin' - six in the mornin')
so what you wanna do?
shit, i got a pocket full of rubbers and my homeboys do too
so turn off the lights and close the doors
but (but what?) we don't love them hoes (yeah)
so we gon' smoke an ounce to this
g's up, hoes down, while you motherfuckers bounce to this

sippin' on gin and juice (laid back)
with my mind on my money
and my money on my mind
rollin' down the street, smokin' indo
sippin' on gin and juice (laid back)
with my mind on my money
and my money on my mind

i got the cultivating music that be captivating he
who listens to the words that i speak
as i take me a drink to the middle of the street
and get to mackin' to this bitch named sadie (sadie?)
