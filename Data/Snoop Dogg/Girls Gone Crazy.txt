forever m.c., forever and a day
rock with do double, let me show you how we play
world full of girls, room full of players
and let me show you how a player play her
oh yeah, she crazy in her own right
i know your legs tired, baby had a long night
get with me, you get your own wife
i know ya how to show ya, how to get it good
spit it too, but very comprehensive
it's written down all in my literature
book, look, it's all for you
the lazier, the crazier, the manier, the zanier
the more for me the merrier, she asked if i can marry her
put my hands up and said "baby, that's our barrier"
i like your style, your look and your character
god bless pimpin', motherfuck america
