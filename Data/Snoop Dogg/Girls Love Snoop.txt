2, 1, 3, and— (gangsta grizzile)
mmm, mmm, mmm (ll cool dram) (what?)
in a world of women (ah)
let's just say that, uh
i love women (me too)
i was raised by my mother (mm-hmm)
and she was raised by her mother (right)
so i guess i'm a bad mother— (shut yo', shut yo'—)
but anyway, i know the ladies love snoop, right? (they love dram too)
and i know girls listen to snoop (ladies love gangsta grillz)
so, uh, i brought my homegirl jane to do her thing (jane did 'em)
