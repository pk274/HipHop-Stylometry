now
what if all this time, i was walkin' with the divine and didn't know?
'cause i was blind, but the light continued to shine (and i know)
favor must be mine, and no matter how high i climb
i know this atmosphere and altitude, intervention divine, cuh
that's on my mama, cuh
nah, let me take that back
that's on god, cuz


as i look up at the sky
my mind starts trippin', a tear drops my eye
now as the streets start to riot
i put my faith in the word, and that's word to the wise man
