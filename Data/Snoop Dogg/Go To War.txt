i use to give and didn't get nothing in return, so
nowadays i'm cautious, who i trust and who i learn from
i need a woman i can grow with (grow with)
know when to talk and when to close it (close it)
hoes be thinkin' they finna come up (hello)
i just give 'em a look, i'm like "no, bitch" (hell no)


you ever heard of reciprocal?
well, you get what you give, it ain't difficult
i had to quiet a bitch down, like "shh, shh, shh" (shut the fuck up)
listen to some real shit, let me interest you
ain't no limit if we gon' get it, but if it's different, i ain't rollin' with it
i'm too slick, i'm just gon' hit it
slide off, light one then ride off (ride off)
there's a couple things you need to get your mind off
