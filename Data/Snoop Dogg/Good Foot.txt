i'm feeling the dough, and now i'm feeling the real
stunning with the stunner, man, i'm one in a mil
hold on to my hands while we walk up this hill
there's a mountain and a fountain but the waters are still
walk in the light but i'm changing drill
me and my homies gangbang on the field
take a knee, make a g, follow protocol
can't you see us kick, capri?
back with the wonder dog
not the underdog, can't you understand?
please believe me, i'm with stevie
mental wonderland
or maybe michael jackson
pure satisfaction
rest in pussy, hugh hef
playboy mansion
been a foe, mental fold
split the difference punk bitch
you on a centerfold
one is soul, never told, forever g
c'est la vie, that's me


tell me what you got for me
i'm getting on the good foot
and see i'm only here to rock wit ya
they tell me that's a good look
see, i'ma keep doing me, 'cause that's all i know
so knick-knack, paddy-wack, kid capri and snoop is back
we do it just it just like this that back (back)


they tried to run a game on a nigga
word to p.e, shame on a nigga
i never paid attention
did i forget to mention
i started up cooking up the cavi in the kitchen
then i graduated, matter of fact i made it
reinstated but still kept it gang related
i traveled the globe, private jets, and versace robes
penthouse suites, what about phony hoes?
tanqueray glasses, smoke fills the air
and hoes with fat asses playing truth or dare
no bizaar, what a lovely pair
and they all came here just to fuck wit a player
anytime i wanna jam, shit i'm runnin' through these hoes
like a pack at the coliseum
marcus allen, bo jackson, and bo diddley
if you know like i know, you come and fuck wit me, fo' real


tell me what you got for me
i'm getting on the good foot
and see i'm only here to rock wit ya
they tell me that's a good look
see, i'ma keep doing me, 'cause that's all i know
so knick-knack, paddy-wack, kid capri and snoop is back
we do it just it just like this that back (back)
