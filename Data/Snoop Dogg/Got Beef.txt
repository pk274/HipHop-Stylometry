yeah, yeah

snoop d-o-double g, l.t. hutton thangs
yeah, we all off up in the hills right about now
it's about two in the morning!
i got big c-style on the grill
eastside!!! keepin' it way real
dogg dogg, lbc

chorus: snoop dogg (repeat 4x)

if you got beef, with dpg

bridge: charlie wilson, snoop


the life i lead
the average nigga would have broke down a long time ago
try to bang in a show and get slumped like the crow
anyday now, we gonna run at my nigga them killas is nathal
we see it all like night owls and we stay on the prowl
they don't wanna see me shine again
they fuckin' with my mind again
but as soon as i finish this heineken
i gotta go get my nine again
(it got a body on it from a party don't it?)
yeah i been tryin' to slang it, but don't nobody want it
they can't help you with band-aids, we comin' with grenades
you ain't seen this many niggas in your life with diamonds and braids
i'm from the home where they get sprayed and gang related raids
fuck y'all, that start bangin' after "colors" was made
let's c-walk to that, and never give me no hassle
cause i come from one of the worst cottage in paso

chorus


now don't come round here fuckin' with us
cuz on the real homeboy, we'll be fuckin' you up
and to you bitches who be thinking y'all could slide by
with that punk shit, bitch, biddity bye bye
i fuck a bitch up faster than i do a nigga
see to me, most bitches is women but bitch you'z a nigga
we got rules and codes, g's and hoes
friends and foes, ride or get rode on

chorus 1/4x
