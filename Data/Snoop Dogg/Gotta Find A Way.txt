it wasn't about money up front
all a nigga wanted was a big gold chain and a blunt
"why? what do you mean?"
living my auntie mary and i ain't having a damn thang
i can't get a job
i might as well steal and rob
man, life is so hard
hanging in my homie garage
while other niggas doing killing for a living in the city of stars
i got a lick but i ain't got caught
nigga slippin' leaving a sack by the bar
and i seen where he set it, thought he had hid it
nope, and i'm about to go get it
come up, i gotta stay run up
left eye open while i'm sleep with the gun up
please don't run up about that money i'm funny
my nigga you'll get done up
