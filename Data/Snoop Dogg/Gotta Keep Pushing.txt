(blackberry molasses)
(one of the things that never change)
(you gotta keep pushing on)
(the sun don't rain all the time)
(there's gonna be some heartache and pain)
you gotta keep pushing on
just sitting here reminiscing, man
pushing on
gotta keep pushing on
mm
you gotta keep push—


who remember growing up eating corn flakes?
spend the night at granny house 'cause momma on a date
so you ate what you ate and you ate it quick
'cause you knew your grandma, she ain't play that shit
paw paw, he stayed in another house
with another woman, she a brick house
growing up fast was a shit show
it's a fеw things i learned from the gеt go
a few folks in my fam fell down
then they got they feet back on solid ground
and came back around and showed me how to fail
see there's a lesson every time a nigga take a l
dead or in jail, that's the fairytale
what i know about it? i know it very well
that's why i don't stop, won't stop, can't quit
keep pushing making that dope shit
