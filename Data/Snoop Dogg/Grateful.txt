no more wrong and i'm tryna do right
thank god for my kids and my lovely wife
the life i used to live, i had to leave it alone
'cause my backbone was 'bout to get it alone
what's a man to gain the world and not share?
everything i went through helped me prepare
for the day that i talk like this
and i'm sure that jesus walked like this
it's a fact though, exacto
rewriting my rap flow
come as you are, i'm posted up at the backdoor
church panic, i'll be making the plans
kissing their babies and shaking their hands
man, god gave me my life back then he brought my wife back
i'm suited and booted, praising his name
through my trials and tribulations, i'm grateful for everything
