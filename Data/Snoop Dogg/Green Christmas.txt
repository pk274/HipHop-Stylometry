kids got a christmas tree, daddy got a tree too
keep some trees on me everytime i see you
light up for the holidays, that's the shit that we do
the people made they voice heard, cali made it legal
now i'm droppin' off gifts, smokin' in the rico
old-school christmas so greet it with some seasonin'
chillin' in the seat i'm in, couple placеs so full
them back to the trees again
kush in the room
now thе purple hit the circle
gorilla glue in the mess
take your time, don't let it hurt you
sippin' on act now
watchin' my grandbaby
bought her some headphones
blowin' so fast, crazy how time flies
look at granddaddy with them sight eyes


baby, christmas to me ain't white, it's green
green, green, green christmas
and it's so easy to see it's gonna be
another green christmas for me, for me
da-da-da-da-da-da, for me, for me
da-da-da-da-da-da, for me, for me
gonna be, for me, for me
another green christmas


jingle bells, my weed smells
like i'm gettin' paid (like i'm gettin' paid)
smokin' real up on the hill
nothin' but top great, oh
i don't need no sock (i don't need no sock)
but i got this green all day (but i got this green all day)
headed to the studio (headed to the studio)
smokin' all the way (smokin' all the way)
