when i come through i'm bangin' like a crip dawg
sippin' on some cisco, hand on my pistol
chicken grease with the crisco
kaepernick, slap a bitch, we in san francisco
this hoe, that hoe, nigga you can add 'em up
been with the shit, two strikes nigga, bat up
jumpin' out the gm with it
i learned how to swim with it
thirteen, learned to mix a lil' gin with it
been with it and you can check my pedigree
let it be, there's a picture of me next to the letter c
i'm confident, the crip keeper
i'm at your door, doing chores with the street sweeper nigga
