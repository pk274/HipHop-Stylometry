good weed up in my blunt, pass the chronic up front
herb by the pound, pay the cutter every month
meditation is the highest, pass me chalice
real ganja baby inside buckingham palace
new york to west coast, love that shit green
ganja man them pull up on the babylon scream
from herbs aroma, atmosphere so clean
i don't want to wake up if this is living a dream
nickels and dimes, no hard times, you never know until you try
say goodbye to the bad guy
had i not known
have blown, home grown, rocking rolling stone
oh, mary jane, could you please take me home?


herb is now a household name, dem seh it commercialize
still my homie up top doing twenty for life
still marginalize though dem sell legalize
herb mek we meditate, invite di life
inna l.a. all day, burn it all night
jamaican marijuana is the people's choice
snoop dogg, what you say? tell them what you like
california kush straight off the bush, never leave me alone
you ever smoke weed that touch your brain and touch your bone?
put you in a zone while you chilling all alone?
with your girl on the phone listening to nina simone
yeah, and now i'm gone
