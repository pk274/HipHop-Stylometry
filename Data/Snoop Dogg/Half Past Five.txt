you and your girls
went to the club
mad at your nigga
lookin’ for love
it’s cool with me
i’mma buy you some bub
slip you a ex
and let you hit on this bud
yeah, i’m that nigga tryna see how it was
and give you a : nate dogg
niggas wanna kick it
but i hardly ever kick it
‘cause when niggas come to kick it
niggas steadily trip
i wanna be your lover
wanna freak you undercover
hoe, don’t worry ‘bout my woman
‘cause my woman, she dip
niggas wanna kick it
but i hardly ever kick it
‘cause when niggas come to kick it
niggas steadily trip
i wanna be your lover
wanna freak you undercover
hoe, don’t worry ‘bout my woman
‘cause my woman, she dip
