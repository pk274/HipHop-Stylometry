when the evening falls
and i'm left there with my thoughts
and the image of you being with someone else
well, it's eating me up inside
but we ran our course, we pretend we're okay
now if we jump together, at least we can swim
far away from the wreck we made


then only for a minute (only for a minute)
i want to change my mind
'cause this just don't feel right to me
i wanna raise your spirits (i wanna raise your spirits)
i want to see you smile but (i want to see you smile)
know that means i'll have to leave


oh, oh, oh
know that means i'll have to leave
lately, i've been, i've been thinking
i want you to be happier, i want you to be happier


so i'll go (i'll go), i'll go (i'll go)
go, go, go
i will go, go, go (go, go, go)
so i'll go (i'll go), i'll go (i'll go)
i will go, go, go (go, go, go, go)


lately, i've been, i've been thinking
i want you to be happier, i want you to be happier
even though i might not like this
i think that you'll be happier, i want you to be happier


then only for a minute (only for a minute)
only for a minute
i want to change my mind
'cause this just don't feel right to me
i wanna raise your spirits (wanna raise your spirits)
i wanna raise your spirits
i want to see you smile but
i want to see you smile
know that means i'll have to leave


oh, oh, oh
know that means i'll have to leave
lately, i've been, i've been thinking
i want you to be happier, i want you to be happier
