made a milli off the flow, now it's time to reinvent it
i'm the soldier and lieutenant, i'm the owner and the vender
yeah, the angel and the sinner, main course and the dinner
my glove with the glitter, doin' deals on thе shitter (what?)
you won't find a nigga realer, you can look around thе globe
shit get hot up in the kitchen, so don't stand around the stove
i'm from long beach, nigga, i ain't hang out at the grove
i was hustlin' with them hustlers gettin' payouts from the blow
blew chucks on the souls of the foot of a man
niggas talkin' about gettin' money, but how good is the plan?
middle finger to the law, one foot in the sand
ran this motherfuckin' town and 'bout to do it again
all the shit these niggas talkin', i can smell they whispers
y'all get higher than i, but me, i remain official
how i walk and how i talk and paint the picture
right before i went insane, let's hit you
nigga, i'ma sing this with you
