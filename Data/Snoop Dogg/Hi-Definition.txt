lupey it's snoopy, let's go wild
tiptoe through the door, do it doggystyle
and tell all my chicks in chi-i-cago
lupey hit the lotto, snoopy hit the bottle
dolemite tight, they bite, they might follow
take this chill pill, lil nigga swallow
recital is very homicidal
the big screen will capture it, 'cause it's high-definition
listen, cooking collard greens in the kitchen
them alphabet boys on a mission
if you ever get cash, you better get it quick fast
'cause nowadays, niggas get to snitchin on yo' bitch ass
even your boys best believe in them toys, out your game
specially when a nigga know your real name
blam blam with the blammer
smile nephew, you on candid camera, film at eleven
dressed in something so fresh and wonderful
f-n-f and s-n double o-p


gather 'round, go a-head and stare
(you street folks don't need permission, my life's in hi-definition)
listen with your eyes follow with your ears
(i don't need no intermission, my life's in hi-definition)
