but ended up bein a chemist
24/7, devin my nigga committed

follow instructions, changed up the dialogue
manifest no stress, life is a big test

diplomas, gowns, caps and degrees
these are necessities in life you need so i'ma get it
focus, committed
15 years later, but yeah a nigga finally did it
uh, now who's to say in life there's ups no downs?
and when you get up, you gotta get down
uh, and when you get up, look around
and don't frown on the ones that's down - just give 'em a hand

nouns and pronouns, they make up my sentence
high school days, uh
