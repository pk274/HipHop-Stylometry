hello, it's snoopy collins, bootsy's baby brother
i got the p in me â€” come on, baby bubba
slippin', slidin', dippin', glidin'
ridin' to a whole new dimension
it's like playin' some ball, me and my doggs
jammin' on all'a y'all (all y'all)
get up off the wall
you can smell it, snoopadelic, run go tell it (that's funky)
they gon' yell it, we gon' sell it
y'all gon' buy it 'cause y'all feel it
the groove just set
one more rhyme, one more crime, one more time
it's all the same, for real'a, my nilla
it's snoop and bootzilla, my nilla
you've been losin', i got the groovin'
that's guaranteed to keep your party people movin'
come on


ah yeah, play on, playa
cincinnati, ohio
ah yeah
yay-yay
we got to do it (do it 'til we get it)
los angeles, california
ah, we ain't on the porch here, mama
