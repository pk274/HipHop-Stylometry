big snoop dogg with a yellow paris hiny
with two girlies in the back in they crip blue bikinis
shaking and they jumping cause the deuce keep bouncing
tipping, whipping, tha ass, steady dipping
candy paint dripping and these axles want a sipping
as i shake like a dice game
cold as the ice age
mike jones rocking like a rolling stone
it's snoop dogg boy i'm b-b-bad to the bone
yeag them cali boys
we love them low lows
an real car club niggas bang they low doors
and take four tows
see everything is fine
i'm in the 64
a 60 trail a 59
i love my car
like i love my wife
see low riding ain't a sport
it's a way of life
on the real dough i'll tell you how it feel though
if you see me in the for creeping slow yo
