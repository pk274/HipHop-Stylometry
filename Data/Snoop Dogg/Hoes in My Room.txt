and what they doing in ya' room? nigga make 'em bail (yeah)

and told security, "let 'em in, with no delay" (ha ha!)
so when they get here, they'll probably be like half naked (woo!)

ay, ay y'all gotta go
y'all gotta get the fuck up outta here, ugly ass bitches
i dont understand how these bitches always get in my dressing room
you know what i'm sayin'?
soon as i get off stage
it's 7 or 8 ugly ass bitches posted up in my dressing room
and security act like they don't know who did it
i know you feel what i'm sayin', all my nigga around the whole world
we need to form a society or something
fat, gorilla, monkey mouth bitches

and if they do, we kindly put our foot up their asses
and re-direct them bitches to security dressing room, you dig?
