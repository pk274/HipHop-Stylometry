yeah, now we gonna talk about these hoes for a minute (talk about these, let's talk about these hoes)


trip, now daz, luke, kurupt, and snoop
come bangin' all the hoes in ya muthafuckin' group
it's a shame, how my game
gon' get that pussy for me in a minute mane
there's hoes all over this place, i bumped a hoe from atlanta
named nevanah, and i, ran a, plan up
that i had designed for another bitch named savannah
man i, had a lot of hoes in my lifespan
even had a bitch from iran named jan
not to mention japan, i had a tight-eyed hoe with dough
ya know? fo' sho'
now ya know i can bump 'em
so when they get out of line i won't hesitate to dump 'em
cause i was taught not long ago
in order to gain a hoe, you gotta lose a hoe
that's why my stable, keeps me able
to buy nice cars, homes, and cables
gangsta haters, a question for y'all
why yo' bitch paws in my draws, holding on my balls?


now let me tell you som' right, a lot of niggas don't understand (nah they don't understand) how real pimps and real players handle their shit (they don't understand, know what i'm talkin' about)
ya know, aye, me and my man, dogg (tell 'em), you know we just puttin' hoes in they place, we pimpin' hoes (pimpin' hoes), laying hoes down (slamming cadillac doors)
you know, a hoe is gonna be a hoe (hoe gon' be a hoe)
some of y'all niggas don't understand that (yo' hoe be a hoe, let the hoe be a hoe fool)
so, so don't act like you don't do it (cause you know ain't nuttin' to it), cause you know ain't nuttin' to it
just like we said, aye, hoes gon' be hoes (lay yo' bitch down, lay yo' bitch down, lay yo' bitch down, yuh, yuh), niggas gon' be niggas
we gon' get ours
aye, y'all hoes gon' be mad
