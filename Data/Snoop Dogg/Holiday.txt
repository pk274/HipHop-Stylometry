look, open your eyes, déjà vu
in ways i knew my focus remains on you
i'm so true, i love that, 'cause who woulda knew?
lbc, me? do what it do
question? is your bathwater ready for ya? (for ya)
'cause i could be the man for ya (for ya)
baby, are your bills paid?
were those dinner reservations made?
the whistles, the bells, how 'bout your hair?
what about your nails?
see, i can have it done for ya (yeah)
looks like i'm the one for ya (yeah)
i'll crack the whip and get a little action in here, my dear
but first, relax a bit, the questions and answers are clear
