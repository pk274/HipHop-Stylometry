yo, nick (yo)

what did it start off at?
three hundred thousand dollars
so it's at $4.8 million?

ayo, hit-boy
i think it's time for another one
yeah, haha
i'm snoop dogg— dogg
and my rhyme— rhyme— rhymes are fresh
i'm snoop dogg— dogg
and my rhyme— rhyme—  rhymes are fresh


walkin' through the sandbox with flip-flops on
this reminds me of a hip-hop song (right on)
no instagrams, no tiktoks on
you run up on the dogg and get bip-bopped on (bip-bopped on?)
back in the days, yeah, they took my songs
but if i get back, then i could live like that (facts)
see, we don't cry over spilled milk
i'm snoop dogg, baby, and i'm smooth as silk
every beat i rapped on, that bitch was killed
every brim i wore, that ho was tilt
i'm standin' tall like i'm walkin' on stilts
aftermath on blast from the house i built, uh (haha)
and that's east to the west, right?
the niggas on my team, they say they livin' they best life
a drug dealer turned ceo
and i'ma show you how to get this dough


livin' what i call the way i did it
doin' it my way, that's how i get it
reppin' the east side, long beach city
keepin' it gangsta is all i know, know
we gon' throw our set up (set up)
and we gon' get our bread up
while i roll my weed up
in my sandbox with my feet up (feet up)


we keep blowin' trees, all these emergencies
a hundred-million-dollar deals with this cryptocurrency
spitter, hitter, did her, get her, man, i got a lotta moves
used to spend a lotta bread on a whole lotta jewels
fools learn fast, so i must be the fastest
took all my classes, learned it by the masses
surpassed all the masters, now i'm the master
last thing out there is my doggystyle masters
yeah, i gotta have it like a bad habit
'cause doggystyle, nigga, was a motherfuckin' classic (ooh-wee)
am i lyin'? no, you not
it was hot, so motherfucker, gimme what you got
now we can get off into some gangsta shit
we can laugh, toast or blast (what up, cuz?)
or you can be a gentleman
and handle this shit like you got some class


livin' what i call the way i did it
doin' it my way, that's how i get it
reppin' the east side, long beach city
keepin' it gangsta is all i know, know
we gon' throw our set up (set up)
and we gon' get our bread up
while i roll my weed up
in my sandbox with my feet up (feet up)


i'm snoop dogg— dogg
