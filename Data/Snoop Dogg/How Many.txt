the main nigga talkin' 'bout he never tell
now he flossin' in the hood leaving a paper trail
lying-ass nigga going straight to hell
first time i heard about his shit, i ain't take it well
nigga in the hood tellin' everybody
baby mama in a brand-new maserati (ooh-whee)
told the side nigga she was fuckin' with me
funky dog-head, nothing-ass bitch
now the word out, the feds knockin' at your daddy house
meeting at the park, after dark
nigga didn't even try and play it smart, couldn't play his part
snitch-ass nigga got the same heart
police talkin' that jail time
it was smoke you a cig and tuck your tail time
you's a bitch, nigga tellin' on everybody on the stand
judge said "point him out", that nigga use both hands
