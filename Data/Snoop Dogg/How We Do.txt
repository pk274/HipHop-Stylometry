boss dogg
even when i'm on, i'm off y'all
lookin' for the king, it'll cost y'all
you better leave now, are you lost, dawg?
the zombie king, yeah, i hear him coming
og ghoul with a thirst for the run-in
you in the wrong bar, wrong town, got a spot to fill
the real deal, coming down that hill
your brains for breakfast, soul on the menu
major checklist, ghouls, goblins, guard the exit
the fire in his eyes, ain't hard to catch it
el diablo, the haunting, taunting veterano
it's scary, i know
the goner gulch, where the drama is
but don't hate the game
we in the zombie biz (yеs, sir)


we feel the love
whеn we all dance together (what, what, what? together)
we made it, made it
up all life long
we won't stop (we won't stop)
el diablo is here


dance! we the baddest crew
hands high, what's eating you? (c'mon, c'mon)
us, we coming through
killing it is how we do
el diablo's on his way (el diablo)
smell the odour of decay
dance, we came to slay
'cause killing it is how we do
