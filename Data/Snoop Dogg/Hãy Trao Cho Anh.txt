lookin' at my gucci, it's about that time
we can smoke a blunt and pop a bottle of wine
now get yourself together and be ready by nine
'cause we gon' do some things that'll shatter your spine
come one, undone, snoop dogg, son tung
long beach is the city that i come from
so if you want some, get some
better enough take some, take some
