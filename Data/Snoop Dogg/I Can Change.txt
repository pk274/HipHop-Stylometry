hey yo nephew check this out man
now i know you got that bad chick right there
you ain't even tripping off of her
but she doing all of that for you
she got this, she got that, man she's off the hizzle
i mean when you find one like that
you got to make that change man
'cause they don't come too often
and when they do come
you gotta be smart enough to know when to change
like sam cooke say, change gon' come nephew
and you better believe that


take me to the river and baptize my soul
i'm so outta control, needing someone to hold
man it's cold
i ain't been clubbin', drinkin', or smokin'
i'm focused, bowin' down every night prayin' and hopin'
i'm trying to figure out a way
but i just don't know how to say
but i'm rearrangin', hopefully i'm changin'
and you can see that baby 'cause it's hard for me
kinda sorta odd for me, but ain't nothing to it
if you need me to do it i guess...
