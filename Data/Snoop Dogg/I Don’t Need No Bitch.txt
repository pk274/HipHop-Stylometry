my mama told me never ever trust one, bust one and break ‘em
be about your paper nigga take it
everyday’s a hustle, got these haters at my neck
suckers tryna get a check
boss dogg does it, hoes wanna call it what it wasn’t
tryna kiss a nigga all in public, bitch, is you crazy?
i preach pimping not pussy, shit i heard it all before
i ain’t no motherfuckin rookie
i’m a long beach, grown twenty? playa ’bout his g’s
i ain’t tripping off these walls
you know these rats is after cheese
messing with my focus, the locust on his grind
they be focus on this dick and keep your focus off my time
stay in the lane that i made for you to chill
until then it’s been real, i gotta handle business
and you i know we’re in it, see tripping gets you nowhere
cause bitch i’m on that


i don’t need no bitch, bitch, bitch, bitch all on me
trippin’ and calling my phone, always lying
i don’t need no bitch, bitch constantly checking on me
bitch don’t even try it
i’m out here grinding, thats why
i don’t need no bitch, bitch, bitch…


i don’t need no bitch, bitch, bitch, bitch all on me
trippin’ and calling my phone, always lying
i don’t need no bitch, bitch constantly checking on me
bitch don’t even try it
i’m out here grinding, thats why
i don’t need no bitch, bitch, bitch…


hell no, i don’t need one
and all that talking and fussing bitch you can miss me
i put these size twelves down on a 10 speed
before i let a bitch get the best of me
(i don’t need no bitch bitch bitch)
the recipe for danger, phone checking, the recipe for anger
i’m from a gang but i don’t wanna bang ya
and i can tell how you tell all your friends about my benz and my ears? bitch
really i’m the perfect stranger, which turned you to the perfect stalker
body like miss parker, maybe get little darker
but i’ma have to pass on that ass you was too much in the first place
never understood when it was work day
and then she all up on your boy in the worst way
you need to detox, bitch see dr. dre
cause crazy ain’t gonna get it, and tripping get you nowhere
cause bitch i’m on that, bitch i’m on that


i don’t need no bitch, bitch, bitch, bitch all on me
trippin’ and calling my phone, always lying
i don’t need no bitch, bitch constantly checking on me
bitch don’t even try it
i’m out here grinding, thats why
i don’t need no bitch, bitch, bitch…


you need to quit talking crazy
i don’t need no bitch
you need to quit talking crazy
