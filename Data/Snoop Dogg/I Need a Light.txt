ayo, dram, you got a light, 'cuz?
i need, i need
i need a light, i need a light
i need a—, i need a—, i need a light
i need a—, i need a—, i need


i need a light, i need a light, 'cause i gotta smoke right now
i need to pick me up (yes), whenever i'm feelin' down
that's why i need a light, i need a light (i need)
'cause i don't really wanna black out (yes, yes)


i'm tryna find me a lighter right now, nigga
is it up under the couch?
baby, you got a lighter over there?


i need a light, i need a light, 'cause i gotta smoke right now
i need to pick me up, whenever i'm feelin' down (down, down)
that's why i need a light, i need a light
'cause i don't really wanna black out


lobster, butter, dos, he goes, big, baby, bakery, overdose
smoke to cope, with a rope of dope, she ain't ever been with a loc' before (oh, no)
so, i show her, blow her mind, mind, mind
peek in the blinds, been seekin' to find
and drinkin' the wine and sneakin' behind it
doggystyle might make you smile
hands on the stick, don't touch the dial
nails foul, crip style, you like style, so you're stuck with brown
busta rhymes and she bust it down, penthouse suit, now we fuckin' around
seven-five to the atl, don't matter, my nigga, i'm takin' a pound
boat, plane, car, train, pull a few strings to get them strains
stranger things, danger, man, anger, man, so i just maintain
twist a spliff, shoot to give, flick the bitch, 'cause i need a hit
too late to back out, dogg pull a sack out
dram, pull a track out, 'cuz, i'm finna black out


man, see that be the thing
when you ain't got no light, you ain't right
