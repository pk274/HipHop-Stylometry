layin' in the bed, a nigga half asleep
moms want her money, she been on me for the past week
a nigga gotta be at work at three (what?)
but i'm like "fuck that job, should've quit that shit last week"
so i hops up and get my hustle on
dippin' through the eastside (eastside), gotta get some real paper
nigga tryna eat right, gain my respect
and work my connections, bang the set
and still change my direction
i want a big house, fancy car, good credit
ain't nothin' to it but to do it, go get it
fuck a nine-to-five, i want diamonds shinin' (shinin')
fuck burgers and fries, i want a private island
stackin' up boxes on the late night shift
can't even get the hook-up from my late-night bitch
for all my real niggas gettin' rich, fuck that, i quit
