yeah, west coast nigga...
cream on the inside, clean on the outside
twenty-fo' on the ol' schools sittin up high (high)
push - i hit the gas, fuck a red light
all chrome chevy signs on my tailpipe
i smash out doggy dogg live the +boss' life+
show these niggas what it cost and how to floss it right
they hear the song and they jerk to it all night
euro grill, candy paint drippin off white (drip, drip, drip..)
yeah, we got the streets turned up
purp in my blunt, brown in my cup
boat motor in my engine, 15s' in my trunk
ice creams' on my feet, i'mma fuck the streets up
(fuck it up!) wet paint job, shift kit, no clutch
pocket fulla money wit some hustle boy chucks
sugar coat seats, soft white crust
they say they ridin clean, but they ain't got it like us!
