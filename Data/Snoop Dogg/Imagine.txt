yo doc, what up my nigga?
snoop dogg, this is what it is mane
this record is so motherfuckin' gangsta man
i think it's time for me and you to just, tone it down a bit
come on


can you imagine being lit up by some hot shells?
imagine being tossed around and put in jail
imagine life when you can't get from under
imagine niggas at ya when you done fo'
remember how they asked you, "what you run for?" and treat ya like a bitch
when they kick you in your dick and take your shit
reactin' like they hate to see you gung-ho
but just imagine if the rabbit got the gun though, but you already know
imagine niggas in the lbc
felt just like snoop dogg and d-r-e
and felt just like them niggas in the 2-1-3
then imagine that's what's coming when you fuckin' with me
imagine you was up on top of this shit
imagine if the bitches could stay off this dick
i mean, imagine we said, "fuck this shit"
imagine if my niggas got together and tore up this bitch, yeah
you can't imagine growing up in jail dumb
happy just to be alive, watching all your people run
would you imagine growing up to sell you
fifty million records worldwide or fuckin' off somebody's son?
imagine if these niggas never saw a color
would it be peaceful in them streets where niggas kill each other?
all a drunk fool get is pissed-on balls
keep fuckin' off my niggas, they gone murder us all
imagine that


"in the name of allah, in the name of god
the beneficent, the merciful
the one god to whom all praise is due
regardless of land, labor, or title
no matter what name you call god by
whenever life seems hard
everybody know that you mustï»¿ talk to god"
