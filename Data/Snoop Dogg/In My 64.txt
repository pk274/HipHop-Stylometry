rag back, bose bass speakers, kenwood amps
vogues crawlin over train tracks
t.i. zip in the fo, yeah if you playing em back
it's the doggy doggy, yeah i got the game back
hat to the back, spilling drink on my lap
beating down your blunt, get my trunk vibrating
tipping and lock, the switches is hot
you might see me tripping through watts
