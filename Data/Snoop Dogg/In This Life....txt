this one's for my sons and my lil' daughter
peace to jmj and my nigga headqcourterz
a gang starr with a gangster, on a mission
world premier, limited edition
my mind keeps driftin cause i haven't had a spliff in
a long time, i'm doin fine, i feel terrific
i bop up the street, c-walk to the beat
it's cold outdoors, so i got to keep some heat
i never know when a cutthroat gon' try to test me
disrespect me, things could get messy
yes he, shoot a good game, like james
i mean jesse, watch out nigga, heavens to betsies
the big drum beater
with a car full of heaters and some fly senoritas
in some stacy's or some chucks, cause i gotsta keep it g'd up
run up on the dogg man you bound to get beat up
