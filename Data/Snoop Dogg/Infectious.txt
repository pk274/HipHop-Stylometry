get it baby
get get it baby
get get it baby
two times, ow!


to kiss your lips, dip, slip into a zone
2, 1, 3, 5, 4 home alone
infectious, gold tips with the chrome
nick nack paddy wack, give me my bone
i want you and i know that you
want me too so let's just do once
own your mind, take your time girl
and put that thing on me

but you fell for me anyway
