wakin' up, feelin' good, rollin' through the neighborhood
do or die, every day, i lead 'em in a different way
i don't take no mess, get it off of my chest
i'ma be dressed to impress, no stress, fresh
off the eastside, trae called me up and said
"unc', i'ma need you on the b-side"
so i came through-a, mic checked, one-two-a
gettin' real funky, kinda smell like manure
eight cars, eight stars
return of the mack with these hot eight bars
flip through it, dip through it
this is the shit that'll make you get to it
break down, give it up, pour it up
now drink it up, roll it up
light it up, how you feel, y'all?
see you in high definition with a mothafuckin' real dogg
