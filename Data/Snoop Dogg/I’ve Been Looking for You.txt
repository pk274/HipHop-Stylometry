everybody loves the sunshine
(what i feel, what i feel, what i feel, what i'm feeling)
folks get down in the sunshine
(when i do what i do, what i do, what i'm doing, doing, doing)
everybody loves the sunshine
(what i feel, what i feel, what i feel, what i'm feeling)
lives get found in the sunshine
(when i do what i do, what i do, what i'm doing, doing)
everybody loves the sunshine


summertime, pockets bulging
something's happening and i'm indulging
electrifying, death-defying, yeah, that's the science
defined with no compliance but my alliance
i'm cold with it, roll with it, so go get it
take some, bass drum, so vivid
picture that, sunset, flowers, and trees
hydraulics and parliament, impala with parlor seats
follow the policy, this a little dp-ology
dress code, cut-off khakis with wallabees
yes sir, we does the most
so i'd like to give a toast to the coast, black excellence


i've been looking for you (let's get it)
you've been looking for me (i gotta get it)
i've been laying low in the shade (i'm laying low, y'all)
the sun is just what i need (i gotta go, y'all)
i've been looking for you (you looking for me)
you've been looking for me (ha, i'm looking for you)
i've been laying low in the shade (lay low, lay low)
the sun is just what i need ('cause everybody loves the sunshine)

the feeling is fine once you fill in the line
ain't no blank spots, just all go tank tops
i'm realer than real and my word is my bond
pop a bottle of don and blow a blunt with lebron
i'm on my way to the tip, ain't no cookies and milk
just satin and silk, i look for my quill
we writing the script, flipping the shit like a flapjack
boss lady, that's my queen, blackjack
21, get it done, we having fun
make dough, legs show, let's make a run
real talk, boss dog, you are the one
the star, the light, and the sun


(i know you heard that)
i've been looking for you (i'm looking for you)
you've been looking for me (you looking for me)
i've been laying low in the shade (i'm laying low in the shade)
the sun is just what i need (you know i need it)
i've been looking for you (i heard)
you've been looking for me (you know it's true)
i've been laying low in the shade (lay low)
the sun is just what i need ('cause everybody loves the sunshine)
