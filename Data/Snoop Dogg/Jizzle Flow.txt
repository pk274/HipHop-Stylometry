ayo, jizzle
i told you
this was that thing that killed john wayne


i'm blue cripping

when i aim it, i squeeze and i catch two slipping
poppin' off, now they nigga gone and they do miss him

all black like shabba
whole block for the one time, yellow tape don-dada

i got a hundred young niggas, all grimy
ebg behind me
