work-work-workin' on these niggas
talkin' on, stalkin' on, c-walkin' on these niggas
lurkin' on these niggas
breakin' bread, take ya meds
to sustain my mindframe
dogg pound, that's my gang
daylight my time change
taste like that bombay
spray like that nine bang
always do my thang
niggas know 10 to 4, stay high, way high
but i can make a drink up out it
i can make you think about it
dpgc, outlaw immortalz
smash that, flashback
get yo tape recorders
push play, good day
get more money
pussy, roll it up, and it betta be that kushy
com-comin' through, thirty deep, no creep
all guns, all hot
king james, all heat
so bow down to the bow wow
the shit gets no reala
long don, king kong
bitch, i'm godzilla
