shot clock and it’s getting late
crossover then hesitate
skate by him like a figure eight
whoever left, dunk bait
give me the ball, can’t wait
catch ’em all with the pump fake
money good, that’s number 8
clutch time, hard in the paint (kobe)
purple and gold, laker legend (killer, killer)
stone cold, ain’t no question
five-time champion, the eighth wonder reigning on ’em
take cover, switched up, then changed numbers (wow)
many tried him, but came up short
24, king of the court
i’ma need backup, mission abort (what?)
you do not know me, you cannot hold me (mvp)
dribbling left and right, then pull it back, kobe (rest in peace)
