tae bo, five, four, three, two, one
working out, chiefing up, creeping up, keeping up
with the joneses, smoke a zone with my pen pals
in my neighborhood, flavor's good, roll up, put some papers to it
straight into it, gon' make him do it, that thing can do it fo sho
get my lift on, while get my spliff on, fo sho
break bad, stay cool, way cool, roll a doob
old school, paid my dues, spray these fools, ladies drool
cause they know what i got
i got a bag of the saturday pot
and it'll keep you up from thursday to saturday night
what do you like?
when you smoke with the dogg, you had the time of your life
now light... the fatty, jump in my cadi
pull your seat back, yup, i know you need that
let it flow, set it go, incredible
that ain't gold, laying low like 10 to 4, on the floor
