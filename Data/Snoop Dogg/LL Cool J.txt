super socco and gin, pop lockin' my pen
hanging out with the twins, servin' yay for my ends
pimpin' hard on her, not play, for real
bake cake for real, let's make a deal
(that's what i)
on the eastside of long
creep slow with your favorite ho
rockin' her boat, what you savin' her for?
me and ras spent days with the ho
in the c-a-r-s-o (c-arson)
johnny struck a match, i crack a new batch
came back with the deadliest catch
no look, cookbooks from scratch
i knock a bad bitch, all that
and show her how to fall back
(that's what i)
frame name, a game, nights to blame
fights with gangs
don't nothin' change, but the grass, man
i came to bang
fire and desire, ice and flame
don't give that bitch your last name
