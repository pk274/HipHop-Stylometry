she and all her girlfriends they go out dressed to win
assumed they had clean energy but took to no enemies
from boys and girls who broke necks to see
i love you cuz you married me when i needed therapy
'cause when it comes down just to me and my money
overseas ball no pivot you talk about it and i love it
and you don't want it from me, ha
you don't want to make nothin' of this
i wonder when will i be happy ain't nothin funny
i need you here to do music and write your raps when
metaphor figure four let it break your back, yeah
come on, baby, let me tell you tell you all the things i feel
straight quoted in nine-trey by the dime
taking shit down we ain't like the price
he clutches the wine and tips it in cyonide
plastics which you recruited tie the guy
you see i live for the love of the street
step in my car lets start the menage-a-trois
girl your high beams is on i wonder how they fit in that bra
what was that? dial 9-1-1 someone's comin' in from the back
i got a autographed shirt they wrote "much love to you"
and he ain't came around 'till i made a 100 grand
