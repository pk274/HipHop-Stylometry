let's roll one, get fucked up
and if you ain't smoking bud, we ain't got no love for ya
let's roll one, get fucked up (put it in the air, air, air)
and if you ain't smoking bud, we ain't got no love for ya


i'm fresh off the motherfuckin' piece of good pussy
now i'm with my nephew, blowing on some cookies
intergalactic, the skies are fractured
take it out the plastic, now light it and pass it
portable, affordable, elegant
see, my shit's the bomb, but it's executive
i say mine, spray mine, playtime
and bust on yo' bitch in the daytime
i puff from the streets to the suites
"dogg, you gon' go to jail", motherfuck the police
see, i ain't never gave a fuck about the law
i smoke everywhere i go, even in little rock, arkansas


let's roll one, get fucked up
and if you ain't smoking bud, we ain't got no love for ya
let's roll one, get fucked up (put it in the air, air, air)
and if you ain't smoking bud, we ain't got no love for ya


let's roll one, get fucked up (roll it up)
and if you ain't smoking bud, we ain't got no love for ya (see, if you ain't smokin', you gotta go)
let's roll one, get fucked up (put it in the air, air, air)
and if you ain't smoking bud, we ain't got no love for ya (what you waitin' for?)


let's roll one, get fucked up
and if you ain't smoking bud, we ain't got no love for ya
