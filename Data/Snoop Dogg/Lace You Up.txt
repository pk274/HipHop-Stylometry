i used to be the same way that you is
until my homie took me 'round to a get-down, sit down
listen for a second, check it for the record
put the needle on the wax, that's whole new perspective
selected with my objective
'cause i'ma keep you protected, every step that you step with
i'm callin' plays like leftwich
it ain't how you came, it's how much game you left with
my lessons effective, see, 'cause your life is invested
and how you get tested, domestic, trust this
your big homeboy done faced up
new shoes nephews, i keep you laced up
