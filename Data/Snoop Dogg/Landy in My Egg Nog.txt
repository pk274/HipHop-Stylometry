hat's off, i'm the black jack frost
i'm cold and motherfuckin' niggas back off
holla daytime get it party out the crack off (mack boss)
in the house (get lost)
i'm about to get loose with somethin' fresh (yes)
clean from the tip top, down to the rest (dress)
the og q, i might do what it do (what's that?)
me too, i'm nothin' less (when i pimp)
that's what we do (then again)
i might just chill
i might have a drink or two, depending on how a nigga feel
but i, all in all feel thankful, money in my pocket and a guap by my ankle (bankroll)
ladies all wonder how i stay so (fly)
but a nigga feel fly-er with a drink (no lie)
so, how many times i gotta tell y'all, happy holidays, but i think i need some landy with some eggnog (eggnog)
