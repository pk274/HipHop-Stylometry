nothing last forever unless you talking 'bout my rap game
i can do it to you like this or like that man
no pressure on me, i'm the freshest homie
walk by faith, to see me is to know me
undeniable, reliable, as fly as they come
the prodigal son and i am the one
insurmountable funds, that's for my daughter and sons
see i remember getting nickels, dimes, quarters, and ones
see i ain't looking back no more, i'm up in paradise
eating steaks and shrimp like a pimp and that's err'night
stepping out the shower, to a mink floor
i'm in the hills, getting money, i got pink toe
max my stacks just like rico, penthouse suite at tinico
i open my blinds to get a view
now tell nigga what it really do?
