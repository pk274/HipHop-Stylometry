that's right, cash right
shining like a flashlight
baby shake your ass right
cause this could be your last night
set the mood, spoon and groom
ladies feel my living room
bobby a, what you say?
ian carey, my dj!
play that song, make it bang
we gon' be here all night long
if you got that feeling, feeling
yeah, now sing the song
d.o. double g, i am sold publicly
speak my mind, take my time
in the sky, i am fly
if you're low, come with me
cause i can get you hella high
join my crew, be my friend
tomorrow night we do it again
same time, different place
what an ass, what a face!
what a life you can have
and you don't have to pack no bags
just get on in, and tomorrow night we do it again
that's how it is, i always does it big
your place or mine? a case of wine?
baby stop wasting time, so take a flight
cause i'm only in town for one more night, ya dig?
