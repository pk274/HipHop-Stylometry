the legend of jimmy bones
sharp as nails, tough as stones
this ain't based on no true story
this the real motherfucker


payback is a dog, and revenge is sweet
murder is the cold that jimmy lifts by these wicked ass streets


i cut ya head off, go ahead get ya lead off, set off
motherfucker bit his leg off
i want revenge, this shit gon' end
you thought i was gone? motherfucker i'm back home
jimmy bones, it's on so ain't no stoppin' this
i'll take you to the necropolis, and place you in the front
remain calm through this damn thang, listen here man
killin' after killin', dealin' after dealin'
you motherfuckers don't really know how i'm feelin'
but i can't waste time and reflect on that
i gotta get these niggas who stabbed me in my back
jeremiah, lupovich, and eddie mack
you turn my peoples out on the crack sack
7-9, remember that, way back? but karma came back
now you motherfuckers gots to deal with that


what goes around, comes around
do unto other, as you would want them to do unto you
it's a dog eat dog world
