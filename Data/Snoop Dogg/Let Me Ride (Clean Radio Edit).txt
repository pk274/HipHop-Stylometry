rollin' in my '6-4
what all the homies sayin'?


it's just another day for dre, so i'll begin like this
no medallions, dreadlocks or black fists
it's just that gangsta glare with gangsta raps
them gangsta tracks makes a gangs of snaps, uh
word to my homies on the streets
and word to these hyped-ass lyrics and dope beats
that i hit you with, that i get you with
as i groove in my '4 on d's, hittin' the switches
bitches, relax, while i get my proper swerve on
bumpin' doggystyle and about to get my serve on
but before i hit the dope spot
gotta get the chronic, the r√©my martin and my soda pop
now i'm smellin' like indonesia
bus stop full of fly honeys and skeezers
they wanna roll in my funky '6-4
pancake, front and back, side to side, and all that, so
when i crawl, i comes correct
now if your ho in my ride, it's your ho you check, fool
now let the chevrolet slide
as i dip and make a trip to the south side, yeah


rollin' in my '6-4
what all the hookers sayin'?


check this out
the sun went down when i hit slauson
on my way to the strip, now i'm just flossin'
checkin' my rearview 'cause brothers, they will do
jack moves, black fools 'cause i smack fools
tryin' to set me up for a two-eleven
get with dre and get caught up in a one-eight-seven
but i don't represent no gangbang
some brothers like trippin', but i just watch 'em hang
so on and so on, why don't you let me roll on?
i remember back in the days when i used to have to get my stroll on
didn't nobody wanna speak
now everybody peepin' out they window when they hear me beatin' up the street
is it dre? is it dre?
that's what they say every single day in l.a
yo, but i ain't trippin', i'm just kickin' it
while my d's keep spinnin' and these hoes keep grinnin' i'll be...


rollin' in my '6-4
what everybody sayin'?
