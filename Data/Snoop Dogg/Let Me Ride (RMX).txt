rollin' down the motherfucking backstreets
with my drink and my cup and my strap in my lap, see
ain't nothin' but the g-funk, bumping in my g thump
hell yeah!
(with all the niggas saying)


right back up in you it's the d-r-e
witta ounce as we bounce through the cpt
diamond in the back,  danas on the wheels
this is strictly for my bitches, now we're hittin' in switches
niggas gettin' jealous cause' hoes be on our dick
but dre don't give a fuck and i don't give a shit
so the '4 won't blow
stoppin' by the spot to get some indo
