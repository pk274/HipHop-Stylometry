go! swizzy! snoop dogg!


i’m in the zone like, lockin’ alone like
niggas keep talkin’ but i’m sittin' on the phone like
picking a bone like, sittin’ on my throne like
niggas is wrong like, singing’ my song like
my nigga i’m so tight, spitin' with gold mic
walk through a dark cloud, came out in a strobe light
rockin’ a robe like, hef with his hoes like
heavy is the head but to me it's just so light
eat with the rich and get back to the low lifes
cup with his cool-aid the flavor is so right
dip in and floss like, ship it in one night
fuck what it cost like, livin’ the boss life


lemme see em, lemme see em, lemme see em up

i’m back in my zone like
living a long life, stuffin’ the bone like
puffin’ a long night, pingin’ the pong like
singin’ a song like, king of the kong like
godzilla fo'realla, my killas is so right
if it don’t go right, make sure you all ride
deuce deuce and a tec-9 with a .4-5
niggas is so dead, my nigga i’m so live
back in my zone like niggas hittin’ my phone like
shoot him some bail like, cuz he won’t tell right?
the homies don’t act like, the homies don’t act right
under interrogation becomes cooperation
that's why i dealt like, solo and bolo like
kick a little ass and talk shit like i’m dolomite
dip in and floss like, ship it in one night
fuck what it cost like, livin’ the boss life
