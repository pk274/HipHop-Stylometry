no more drama
no more fights
i'm, movin' on, i'm livin' my life
i, gotta make a change, you argue too much
you be callin' me and pagin' me for what
just to bring me down
i'm threw with that
look, mama
you can't be doin' that, you and that loud mouth
friend of yours have a nigga bendin' corners
now you got me bendin' doors
i'm on two
don't do that
i dip through the bee-zack
and slide through in my lee-zack
mack that, crack that, a new one
and get two
and now i'm feelin' brand new
pimp's up, say it, snoop
what it is, what it do
bet it do, what it s'posed to
roll it on, girl, cause i'm a roller coaster
i get what i'm 'posed to
and this is time
and time is money and money is time, so i'm gone

hook: ai
gotta know when to let go
gotta know when to let go
gotta know when to let go of drama
gotta know when to let go
gotta know when to let go
gotta know when to let go of drama
hey

repeat chorus
