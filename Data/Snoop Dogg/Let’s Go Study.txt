i wanna go study, baby would you be my buddy?
and help me with my project, cause you are who i roll with
honestly i know it, take me boo, you the one i wanna go with
five days out the week, my stay's out the street
it pays to be discreet, your fragrance is sweet

honeydew, money do
but this ain't about no money, this about me and you making ooh
take it from me, first day of school i'm looking cool, i got my clothes pressed
i'm a senior but i'm seeming like an old vet
time will pass me by if i don't graduate this time so i expand my mind
find ways, to elevate it, motivate it, calculate it, reinstate it
look at you girl, you got me dedicated


uh, put me on the game
though i keep my head in these books, i'm not a lame
usually kinda square, i'm trying to use it for a change
telling bitches things, like if wanna get with me you gon need a lot of brains
and just cause i don't play, who say i can't ball?
my nigga mac, dude me and him is in the same hall
so don't get mad if i relax and get my bake on
just promise that you'll try to catch me if my grades fall


devin there you are, look at my repertoire
spitting game, you know for reppin hard
change that perspective, that's my objective
cool and oh so collective, connected
check this, i need you more that you could know
see you the seed in my weed, baby help me grow
let it go, let me know where to meet at
student of the week, baby i will be that, you know i need that


call you on your phone and never come see you, darling i will never do that
i'm roaming through the halls and asking people who be with you just to try to know where you at
call you on your phone and never come see you, darling i will never do that
