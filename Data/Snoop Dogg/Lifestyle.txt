"west coast"



i jumped outta bed this morning feelin' good as a motherfucker sunshine on my mind give it to me brother
or roll wit me see what you discover

the oh why got the shit that make stevie wonder
so fly do or die give me ya number
ok kj make the beat a slumper
he is able no cables bitchi be the jumper
12 gauge i call her rage and love to pump her
let off a few shots clap clap dump her
and now i'm sitting in my coupe
system banging like a motherfucker big snoop dogg
shuttin' it down crawlin' around with the pound
gangsters make the world go round & round, ya feel me now?
come close so you can hear me now..
