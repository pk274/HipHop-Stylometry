wake up, jumped out my bed
i'm in a two man cell with my homie lil 1/2 dead
murder was the case that they gave me
dear god, i wonder, can you save me?
i'm only eighteen, so i'm a young buck
it's a riot, if i don't scrap, i'm gettin' stuck
but that's the life of a g, i guess
eses way deep, shanked two in the chest
best run 'cause brothers is droppin' quicker
uh, too late, damn, down goes another nigga
bouncin' off the walls, throwing them dunks
gettin' that rep as a young hog
it ain't nothin' like the street life
you better be strapped with your shank, 'cause ain't no fist fight
so i guess i gots to handle mine
since i did the crime, i gots to do my time


somethin' for the real ogs to get with
some facts, made our made, now you runnin' but don't play
like every single day, really, though
you know me, i'm the smooth macadamien, gamin' them for my homie
no needing bein' calm if you pack right
and earnin' just enough to keep your sack right
late nights, i wonder what they gettin' for?
early mornin' on the corners, what they hittin' for?
seven young g's put they serve down
in a g ride, east side's where they swerve now
not thinkin' about what's really goin' on
got crept on, stepped on, now they gone
i spent four years in the county with nothin' but convicts around me
but now i'm back at the pound
and we expose ways for the youth to survive
some think it's wrong but we tend to think it's right
so make all them ends you can make
'cause when you're broke, you break, check it out
so ain't no need for your mama to trip
'cause you's a hustlin'-ass youngster, clockin' your grip
