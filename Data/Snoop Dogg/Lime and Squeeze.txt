a gang of pretty women and they all in the soaker
iâ€™m feelin' like i felt in that corona commercial
play your shit, layin' back, enjoyin' the breeze
fix me a drink, grab the lime and squeeze
i'm just that nigga she been tryin' to please
so we hopped in my car, let me find my keys
started up and drove down the block
next thing you know, she was on top, roof missin'
the coupe drippin', all wight lennon, suit pimpin'
while i'm throwin' up deuce, crippin'
'fore you trippin', i'm the same og, no trickin'
no cupcakein' and no sippin'
i'm chillin' with baby, she way badder than most women
i like her friend, she don't mind, so go get her
pretty face with an ass that i couldn't believe
the wind blowin' through her long-ass weave
