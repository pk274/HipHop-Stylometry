lodi dodi, we likes to party
we don't cause trouble, we don't bother nobody
we're just some niggas who're on the mic
and when we rock up on the mic, we rock the mic (right)
for all my dogs keepin' y'all in health
just to see you smile and enjoy yourself
'cause it's cool when you cause the cozy condition
in which we create  'cause that's our mission
so listen close to what we say
because this types of shit happens every day
i woke up around ten o'clock in the morning
i gave myself a stretch up, a morning yawn, and
went to the bathroom to wash up
i threw some soap on my face and put my hands upon a cup
and said, "um, mirror mirror, on, the wall
who is the top dog of them all?"
there was a ruffle duffle, five minutes it lasted
the mirror said, "you are, you conceited bastard"
well, that's true, that's why we never have no beef
so i slipped off my khakis and my gold leaf
used oil of olay 'cause my skin gets pale
and then i got the file for my fingernails
i'm true to the style on my behalf
i put the bubbles in the tub so i can take a bubble bath
clean, dry, was my body and hair
i threw on my brand new doggy underwear
for all the bitches i might take home
i got the johnson's baby powder and cool water cologne
now i'm fresh, dressed like a million bucks
threw on my white socks with my all-blue chucks
stepped out the house, stopped short, "oh no"
i went back in, "i forgot my indo"
then i dilly (dally) i ran through a (alley)
i bumped into this smoker named (sally) from the (valley)
this was a girl playing hard to get
so i said, "what's wrong?" 'cause she looked upset
she said, um


damn, now what was i to do?
she's crying over me and she was feelin' blue
i said, "um, don't cry, dry your eye
and here comes your mother with those two little guys"
her mean mother step, then says to me, "hi"
decked sally in the face and punched her in the eye
punched her in the belly and stepped on her feet
slammed the child on the hard concrete
the bitch was strong, the kids was gone
somethin' was wrong, i said, "what was goin' on?"
i tried to break it up, i said, "stop it, just leave her"
she said, "if i can't smoke none, she can't either"
she grabbed me closely by my socks
and so i broke the hell out and i grabbed my sack of rocks
but um, they gave chase, they caught up quick
they started cryin' on my shoes and grabbin' my dick
and sayin', "why don't you give me a play
so we can break it down the long beach way
and if you give me that okay
i'll give you all my love today
doggy, doggy, doggy, can't you see?
somehow your words just hypnotize me
and i just love your jazzy ways
doggy dogg, your love is here to stay"
and on and on and on, she kept goin'
the bitch been around before my mother's born
i said, "cheer up," so i gave her a hit
i said, "you can't have me, i'm too young for you, bitch"
she said, "no, you're not," then she starts cryin'
i says, "i'm nineteen," she says, "stop lyin'"
i says, "i am, go ask my mother
and with your wrinkled pussy, i can't be your lover"


yeah, uh, tick-tock, you don't stop
and to the, uh, tick-tock and you don't quit
yeah, tick-tock and you don't stop
and to the, uh, tick-tock and you don't quit
bitch
