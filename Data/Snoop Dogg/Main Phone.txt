i'm on a road to the riches, checkin' paper, mane (paper, mane)
i wanna play in gold like a laker, mane (laker, mane)
my bitch too negative, gotta shake her, mane (shake her, mane)
sheâ€Š gotta catch me in the wind like a paper plane
i came up in the '80s when the women were defensive
so i came up with a counter called passive-aggressive pimpin'
when you make 'em feel lucky for fuckin' me in the loft
help 'em bust nuts and they helpin' me buy trucks
not outright, but a nice down in the first month
i mean, i'm not really pimpin', my nigga, fuck you on?
beats slappin', 9 milli' packin'-ass nigga
oh, soon slew city slew mackin'-ass nigga
i am spit-taking llama
'bout my decimals, digits, commas
rubles, shillings, pesos, watch out
because punk shit lead to trauma
that's why i'm on my


nike cortez on my feet in a deep sleep with a freak
from the meet and greet, now it's left to me
rick bounced the beat, gave a ounce to p
had to cut the bitch off for popping off to me
i'm back to business relentlessly, i ain't done 'til i'm finished
variety in your society and bitch, i'm the menace
you wish i would call back, you wish i would fall back
see, i'm a dope boy, so i'm a need my football back
in and out these routes like i was julian edelman
i needs all mine from the shit i been peddling
i'm settling for nothing less than the top notch
jumping over all you hoes like hopscotch
bitch, back up off me and leave me alone
i'm walking my dog a half a mile from my home
on my phone, tryna get rich, talking shit to a bitch
coming up with some shit like this


yeah, holla at me
no, i'ma text you from my other number
yeah, it's the 818
oh, you want me to hit you from the 213?
we find our hero, blaps bastardly, roaming the land
with nothing but his mpc and his moral compass in hand
avoiding all punk shit, not needing two dollars in his hand
weaving through the malevolent man and malevolent plan
you got to catch him
