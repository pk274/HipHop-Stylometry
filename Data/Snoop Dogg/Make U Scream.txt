you ever laid on some pink mink sheets blowin' swishers
holdin' on some champagne while doin' ya damn thang
caressin' on tha world main
adressin'' you is no pain
betty wright is playin', no pain, no gain
i did it for the hell of it
hit it now you tell a bitch
now she want a little bit, i did it for the smell of it
it's relevant and evident
yeah girl you heaven sent
i love the way you break and take all the evidence
pimpin 'cuz i'm stayin' in your mothafucking residence
while you out bringin' me back the dead presidents
(pimpin', pimpin', pimpin')
you can say that i got you
i do it 'cuz i have to, plus i feel like i got you
