ayo, g-one, i've been listening to this nigga quik album
and he ain't got no songs about the pussy
you know that nigga gotta have something about the pussy on
this shit, you feel me?
and i'm just that nigga to beat the pussy up
so, uh, if you feel me like i feel you, ya know what i'm sayin'
let me get a little piece of this thang here like that there
trip...


let a nigga from the e.s. l.b. d.p
beat that pussy 'til it's soft and mushy
i love that bushy, and most niggas still do
unless that bitch shit smells like mildew
we'll do damn near anything to get it
and once i got it, i'm outtie, i stay 'bout it
i sip a little tea then light up my weed
i slip on my rubber out the cover then i proceed
to give your little thick ass what you need
gangsta gangsta, i'll make ya cootie cat scream
didn't i turn ya on like a phone?
you lovin' that doggy dogg meaty bone
when ya moan, ya whole voice tone
make me wanna put my bizalls in ya jizaws, and y'all
know what i'm gettin' at, i'm spittin' at
nigga wanna fuck, trick; so what's up, bitch? (biotch)
see as long as my muthafuckin' dick get hard
and i got a million dollars banked out on my credit card
no disrespect or no disregard
but i'm hoppin' for that pussy like they used to hop for cars
my nigga dj q told me come on through
'cause he got a gang of bitches that was down to do
keep it poppin' since i'm from the big lbc
that's right down the street from compton
i pop in the liquor store to grab some hay
a bag of ice, some blue dice, and some cognac
yeah, the pussy's good
especially when it's from a whole 'nother neighborhood
how good do it get when you on that g shit?
i'm strokin' that pussy 'til that bitch seasick
we dick bitches down and that's rule #3 in the dogg pound
bitch, drawers down!
