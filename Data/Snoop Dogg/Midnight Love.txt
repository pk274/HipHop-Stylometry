i'm makin' things happen fast
ain't no need to wait around for what never seems to come along
face lookin' stupid, broke, startin' feelin' dumb
i'm young but i'm a grown man
takin' thangs into my own hands, i'm tryna own land
but life'll twist ya like a twister, get twisted with this
it seems on but it's off, i keep missin' this shit
i'm high but i try to stay focused, wide-eyed
lookin' dead at the chips, i blink, they dip
it's hard to hang on, but i can't let go
smokin' on my last breath
blow out life what's left is death
now i can go wrong or i can g or make a right
whatever way that i turn, it's still death after life
and if it don't discourage me, i ain't got nothin' to lose
but some thoughts that probably never turn to money to burn
but i learn 'cause i see, and i earn 'cause i g
but, these problems probably have a nigga gray and deceased
at an early age so at an early stage in life
i chose to get my shit tight, you gotta struggle and fight
it cost an arm and a leg just to live on your knees
and i'm tryna keep my sanity, god help me please


mischievous and devious is how my life was
puttin' the serve down with cavi just to keep the cluckers buzzed
some of the money makin' motherfuckers from the other side
was thinkin' about a jack move, tryna whoo-ride
gettin' jealous 'cause my niggas got this rap game sold up
them niggas wanna trip (brrr-brat-dat), they got blowed up
grown up or not, you can still get shot
you don't never play a motherfucker out for his knot
rule number one, pay attention to this shit
don't be fuckin' wit' my niggas on the midnight shift, shit (shit)
he kept gettin' it on to the break of dawn
now he's known for servin' more than an ozone
he's got a 1-8-7 on his motherfuckin' chest
a strap in his lap and a bulletproof vest
he's lookin' for them niggas from the night before
12:01 he layin' low all in a nigga back do'
