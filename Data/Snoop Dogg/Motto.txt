nigga, look, fuck around and your shit took
read a book, i kick ass, i'm bigfoot
i sit, observe, and curve 'em like a fish hook
i'm in the suburbs swervin' with your bitch, look
we burn rubber, me, her, and her lover
that's my motto, hit the lotto, pick a number
i'm feelin' froggy, might jump in a bitch throat
fuckin' with doggy dogg, nigga, that's all she wrote
don't be talkin' money, but you're always broke
you can get the back with all the pistol smoke
let me handle my business, nigga, back up in this bitch
captain crippin', don't miss the motto
