nigga what y'all for?
comin' in is the boss, drippin' with sauce
bitch it ain't my fault, the fights are fault
and all the cars i bought
two-time villain, ain't no tellin,' if you cold
take that loss, don't get crossed
ring them bells, stay g, we broke, we fail
no details, we ring bells
we the grandkids of the slaves y'all couldn't kill
for that ill-will y'all put on us
always got your motherfuckin' foot on us
ain't no escapin' facts, so for that
motherfucker, take that
and every nigga that i'm with is invincible
but welcome to the school, nigga, i am your principal
and did i mention (what?)
that i'm the crook that can cook in the crippin' kitchen


awh, and there you have it
a razzmatazz, a blast from the past
mount westmore, can you believe it?
e-40, snoop dogg, too $hort, and ice cube
yahaa
