as i look up at the sky
my mind starts tripping, a tear drops my eye
my body temperature falls
i'm shaking and they break in tryna save the dogg
pumping on my chest and i'm screaming
i stop breathing, damn, i see demons
dear god, i wonder, can you save me?
i can't die, my boo boo's 'bout to have my baby
i think it's too late for praying, hold up
a voice spoke to me and it slowly started saying
bring your lifestyle to me, i'll make it better
how long will i live? eternal life and forever
and will i be the g that i was?
i'll make your life better than you can imagine or even dreamed of
so relax your soul, let me take control
close your eyes, my son, my eyes are closed


murder
murder was the case that they gave me
murder
murder was the case that they gave me

i'm fresh up out my coma
i got my mama and my daddy and my homies in my corner
it's gonna take a miracle they say
for me to walk again and talk again, but anyway
i get fronted some ki's to get back on my feet
and everything that nigga said came to reality
living like a baller loc
having money and blowing hella chronic smoke
i bought my mama a benz and bought my boo boo a jag
and now i'm rolling in a nine-trizzay el do-rad
just remember who changed your mind
'cause when you start set-tripping, that ass is mine
indeed, agreed, proceed to smoke weed
never have a want, never have a need
they say i'm greedy but i still want more
'cause my eyes wanna journey some more, really though (check it out)


now i lay me down to sleep
i pray the lord, my soul to keep
if i should die before i wake
i pray the lord, my soul to take


no more indo, gin and juice
i'm on my way to chino, rolling on the grey goose
shackled from head to toe
twenty-five with an izzel, with nowhere to gizzo, i know
them niggas from the other side recognize my face
'cause it's the o.g. d-o-double-g, l-b-c
mad dogging niggas 'cause i don't care
red jumpsuit with two braids in my hair
niggas stare as i enter the center
they send me to a level three yard, that's where i stay
late night i hear toothbrushes scraping on the floor
niggas getting they shanks, just in case the war
pops off, 'cause you can't tell what's next
my little homie baby boo took a pencil in his neck
and he probably won't make it to see twenty-two
i put that on my mama, i'ma ride for you, baby boo

murder was the case that they gave me
