me and my friends, we right back at it again
and we don't plan on stoppin' so you best to come on in
we got henn, we got 'gain, we got gin, we got kin
we got everything you want and we keep a trunk of funk
let the dj play the record that i love which is mine
bring it back, come rewind, let it bang one time
yeah, i knew you like to party like i party, like i party
dog house, no doubt, now, back, back, back (you know, you know, you know)
