i built this from the ground, pound up
until i knock your roof off
new boss snoop off and on and
heed him in the morning catch him while he yawning
my bitch is on the phone and my homies 'bout to zone in
cracky smacky dippy whippy habitual potential
strip for your credentials
mental unessential, shit's official like a referee with a whistle
nah my nigga shit's official, like a jihad, muslim with a missile

hard times, bad times, fuck doing jail time
cook it up rock it up bag it up and sell mine
