bank accounts, big cars
living good like a movie star
my mama house ain’t in the hood no more
i moved her out to san lu' obispo
but it's a trip, though, 'cause i'm a 20 crip though
i gotta lay low, my homies wanna do low
i got two strikes and i'm gonna get my third
these niggas snitching on me, they think i'm selling birds
so when i'm in the streets, i'm quick on my feet
see, talk is cheap so i stay quick on my heat
you niggas bad? well, dogg is badder
"rat-a-tatta!", make you niggas scatter
i one shotta, your boy want me now
went to the station, that nigga straight point me out (snitch)
so i'ma lay away and spray away and spray away
'cause at this time i think it's best to just stay away


separate, elevate
concentrate, dominate, and innovate
try to be, fly as me
and every other homie tell a lie to me
i need a deal, i need some stones
i need some beats, dogg, i need a loan
help me out, throw me some cash
if i got it, you got it and you ain’t got to ask
but on the real - or is it lately?
a lot of homies done tried to implicate me
they say i changed; is it the fame?
if i throw it to you, then charge it to the game
money fold: overload
in the hood, another episode
man, i'm getting old, the game cold
yeah, i'm from the dub, but that ain’t how i roll
