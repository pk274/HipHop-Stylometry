big long cadillac, 4's on them thangy-thangs
karma hole with the marble floor, inscribed is my family name
pitbulls, swimming pools
fly you out on my private plane
fly you back below my sack
and get a new batch that'll do the same
ah, man, cold game, front row seats at the laker game
kobe bryant, that's my nigga
juicy j, blaze, my nigga
we up in here, we ain't gonna stop
a hundred niggas that did move your plot
a hundred more rich niggas back on the flight now
when will this shit ever stop? never
the bigger the money, the bigger the bang
the bigger the trigger, the bigger the bang
listen for shake up for shame
listen, my niggas, that this is my thing
dog house, laid out on forty acres waiting
kobe bryant, that's my neighbor
yeah, that's paper
