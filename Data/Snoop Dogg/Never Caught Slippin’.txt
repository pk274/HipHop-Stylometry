hell yeah, big snoop dogg comin atcha live my nephew nottz, another dirty music production, can you dig it? yabba-dabba-doo!
something gangsta for you


i got killers on my team
riders on my side
don't act like you want it, cause you can get it
we ride
everybody know about us
that's big snoop dogg aka mr. calvin broadus
i got the key to the secret garden and get money out the ho that's in my glove compartment
right next to the heater, hotter
we dippin' and bouncin' like a teater-totter
my nigga tryin' to get a seed up out her
nah, not me, i had a rubber on, now he the father
trying to blame it on the dogg
i got enough problems of my own, ya'll
young and i'm restless
trying to be the best at this

that's probably why i stay on some other shit
so whether you like me, hate me, you're loving it
i do it for the fuck of it


that's right y'all.  ain't nothing to it but to do it.  put your pimp foot forward and let the other one come behind.  you know?  that's how we're doing it ya'll.  we just ride, glide, slippin' and slide.  all through your ear hole, given ya' what they ain't got.  another dirty music production
