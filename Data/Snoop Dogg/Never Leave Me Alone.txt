man, somebody was naughty when they snitched on me
and the judge just sentenced me to do about a century
i'm mobbin' through the county mainline
back in 9500 just tryin' to handle mine
spittin' game at the homies about the good ol' days
as we try to pass time waiting for the chain to chino
i see no reason to cry but i miss my baby boo
and my nigga spanky too
it's true that the dirt i did from an o.g. to a snotty nose kid
got me caught up in the rapture like maze, days gone by
and real g's gon' cry
but i try to walk the yard with my head to the sky
and hope my baby boo ain't fuckin' niggas on the outside
but what's the chance that it ain't crackin'?
if i was out and she was in i'd probably be mackin'
i can't lie so i say i would, now my girl in a world of playa hood
a playa should show a nigga love and look out
but the niggas i know would probably turn your ass out
so keep away, better yet stay away
and hope i get out one day, okay
but if i don't, i guess this is home
my girl is trippin' she got a block on her phone
