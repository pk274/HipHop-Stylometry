i used to dream of bein' on records that they played at the barbecue
handled some spinners, manhattan's traumatic
from marvin to mayfield (uh) from mavis to gladys
done some' with the best (ooh) to the best
so, i guess i'm the status, yeah
my momma played it every day (yeah)
on her eight-track cassette
mom's played the best, that's why i'm so fresh
and you know that, fo' sho' that
it's gettin' good to me (yeah), feelin' like a throwback
