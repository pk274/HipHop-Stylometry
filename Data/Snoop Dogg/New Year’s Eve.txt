we're having a good day
let's make it a great night
you know i see you
and tell you you're so tight
my special lady
you're one of a kind
and every time i see you shine
it's like the lights of midnight
on new year's eve
and i do believe
on new year's eve
we can make it
we can live forever

11:59 and not a second later
she's stayin' in the mix like a crossfader
it's about to go down
no elevator
live for the moment
love in the air
she got me feeling like
i don't wanna be your player
real talk
so i don't wanna be unfair
now watch the apple drop
and celebrate the year
i see you shinin' away
from over there
and all the other girls
no, they don't compare
i whisper something bond to you
all up in your ear
i infiltrate your mind
and then i penetrate her
i get it crackin' baby
call me the ... lady


we're having a good day
let's make it a great night
you know i see you
and tell you you're so tight
my special lady
you're one of a kind
and every time i see you shine
it's like the lights of midnight
on new year's eve
and i do believe
on new year's eve
we can live forever

grab a glass
make a toast to the good life
bacardi, lime and ciroc
it will pass the time
leather seats in the back of a phantom ride
you stay on my mind so i had to make you mine
master kush smoke for a master mind
my special lady
only one of a kind
i never seen it comin'
i guess love is blind
new year's watch the city come to life
i must say girl
you're looking right
your hair did, nails did, dress
fitting tight
i think i just might
see she's the one i like
see we can look forever girl
let's get hot one night


we're having a good day
let's make it a great night
you know i see you
and tell you you're so tight
my special lady
you're one of a kind
and every time i see you shine
it's like the lights of midnight
on new year's eve
and i do believe
that you and me
we can live forever
