ready for a kush shotgun
but i'm watching niggas, don't wanna have to pop one
that's my weed, nigga (what?)
hit 'em with the bop gun
money talk, drop some
don't like it? you can leave, nigga
california drippin' in my low-rider
hit the switch, bounce, then it go higher
def jam, don't give a damn
rollin' backwoods by the gram

king kush, they call me sire
smoke with the boss, i'ma get you higher
with snoop dogg, ain't nothin' flyer


we only smoke fire
