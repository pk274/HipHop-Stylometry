hard times and good times... when they're mixed together
it can only make you stronger... even live a little longer
i see the gs on the corner, holding steel, think they're real
but oh, it's only a short life...
pennies on their eyes cause they won't see tomorrow


sometimes, i wanna run away, but i'm holding on to what i feel
in this life, we don't crush no deals, back in the day
back in the day when i used to be a mindless kid
now i'm on that holy bid, no regrets for the things i did
it's the only way, only way, only way...
to live with no regrets...
you know you'd better live with no regrets


you can roll up your problems, smoke 'em like a champion
you can pray for a miracle, and still nothing can happen
i ain't never bid us over, and i'm no predictor of the future
but i know, it's a short life...
pennies on their eyes cause they won't see tomorrow
