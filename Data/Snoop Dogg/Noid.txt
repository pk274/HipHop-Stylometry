oouuwee, this weed got me paranoid (so ‘noid, so ‘noid)
oh shit, the effects hit me so hard (so high, high, high)
it must be full of cannabinoids (cannabinoids, cannabinoids)
please sell me a quarter, how much you want for it? (sell me some) (how much you gonna charge?)

this year thanksgiving fell on a tuesday
it’s my world, motherfucker, fuck what the rules say
all black clouds like it’s your doomsday
married to the game, so this is what the groom say
i’m so motherfuckin’ ‘noid right now
good thing that i’m hangin’ with my boys right now
all the way to heaven with devin and berner
i got my dope sack off of 11th and verner
and it's a cookie pack
big snoop dogg, yeah i took it back
see i’m a veteran, nigga you a rookie pack
look at that nigga right here, and those bitches over there
and all of that smoke that’s floatin’ in the air
yeah we ball and pop
on my block you better not call the cops
no matter what you thought or what you’d seen
hid my dope so i can get away clean
