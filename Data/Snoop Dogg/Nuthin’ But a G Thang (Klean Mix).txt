{verse 2 dre dre & snoop dogg}

dre, creep to the mic like a phantom
well i'm peepin' and i'm creepin' and i'm creepin'
but i damn near got capped 'cause my beeper kept beepin'
now it's time for me to make my impression felt
so sit back, relax, and strap on your seatbelt
you never been on a ride like this before
with a producer who can rap and control the maestro
at the same time with the dope rhyme that i kick
you know and i know, i flow some ol' funky ish
to add to my collection, the selection
symbolizes dope, take a toke, but don't choke
if you do, you'll have no clue
of what me and my homie snoop dogg came to do



it's like this and like that and like this and uh
it's like that and like this and like that and uh
it's like this
(

fallin' back on that bass with a bellified gangsta lean
gettin' funky on the mic like a old batch of collard greens
it's the capital s, oh yes i'm fresh, n double-o p
d o double-g y, d o double-g, ya see
showin' much flex when it's time to wreck a mic
pimpin' hoes and clockin' a grip like my name was dolomite
yeah, and it don't quit
i think they in the mood for some motherfuckin' g shit (

is where it takes place, so when asked, yo' attention
mobbin' like a lil' boy but i ain't lynchin'
droppin' the funky stuf that's makin' the sucker dudes mumble
when i'm on the mic, it's like a cookie, they all crumble
try to get close and your butt'll get clapped
my guy, my homie doggy dogg has got my back
never let me slip, 'cause if i slip, then i'm slippin'
but if i got my nina, then you know i'm straight trippin'
and i'ma continue to put the rap down, put the mack down
and if you chickens talk smack, i'll have to put the smack down
yeah, and you don't stop
i told you i'm just like a clock when i tick and i tock
but i'm never off, always on to the break of dawn
c-o-m-p-t-o-n, and the city they call long beach
puttin' the shit together
like my nigga d.o.c., "no one can do it better"



like this, that and this and uh
it's like that and like this and like that and uh
it's like this
and who gives a fuck about those?
so just chill, 'til the next episode
