one, two, three and to the four
snoop doggy dogg and dr. dre is at the door
ready to make an entrance so back on up
'cause you know we're 'bout to rip shit up
give me the microphone first, so i can bust like a bubble
compton and long beach together, now you know you in trouble
ain't nothin' but a "g" thang, baby
two loced out niggas goin' crazy
death row is the label that pays me
unfadeable so please don't try to fade this (hell yeah)
but, um, back to the lecture at hand
perfection is perfected, so i'ma let 'em understand
from a young g's perspective
and before me dig out a bitch, i have to find a contraceptive
you never know, she could be earnin' her man and learnin' her man
and at the same time burnin' her man
now, you know i ain't with that shit, lieutenant
ain't no pussy good enough to get burnt while i'm up in it (yeah)
and that's realer than real-deal holyfield
and now you hookers and hoes know how i feel
well, if it's good enough to get broke off a proper chunk
i'll take a small piece of some of that funky stuff

fallin' back on that ass with a hellafied gangster lean
gettin' funky on the mic like a old batch of collard greens
it's the capital s, oh, yes, i'm fresh, n-double-o-p
d-o-double-g-y, d-o-double-g, you see
showin' much flex when it's time to wreck a mic
pimpin' hoes and clockin' a grip like my name was dolemite
yeah, and it don't quit
i think they in the mood for some motherfuckin' g shit (hell yeah)
so, dre (what up, dogg?)
gotta give 'em what they want (what's that, g?)
we gotta break 'em off somethin' (hell yeah)
and it's gotta be bumpin' (city of compton)


like this, that and this and a—
it's like that and like this and like that and a—
it's like this, and who gives a fuck about those?
so just chill 'til the next episode
