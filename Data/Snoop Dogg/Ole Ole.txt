don't want to go, never wanna leave
you can stay here forever with me
you could be the one, i could be too
if this was my last chance, i'd give it to you
party and bullshit, this what we do
i am the one so you could be mine too
ooh wee, the la-la, dance with me boo (c'mon)
hands in the sky, don't stop until i tell you to
dynamite, want to party light
gettin' to it 'cause you do it, 'cause you do it right
you're gonna feel it so let it go
pretty lady, baby-baby, won't you let it go
