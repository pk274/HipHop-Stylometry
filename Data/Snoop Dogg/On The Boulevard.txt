i'd rather be ridin' than walkin'
while all you loud mouth niggas keep talkin'
all you high paid niggas stay fly
i'ma slide left, fly right on by
i'ma do it on the boulevard
fast bitches, fast cars and stars
stayin' boxed up eatin' caviar
lookin' for the next play to have it all, ah nah

it's funny how the game goes
new face but they look like the same hoes
i try to get away, everybody wanna hit of dre
stay focused, bang i done hit a day

nigga fuck what cha' heard, shit is all lies
niggas mad dre and snoop stayin' multi

my career in fifth gear while y'all's dyin'

you thinkin' california all sun and surf, for sho'
i can see you walkin' under the earth

my gun burst em'

and i still got my first mil'
still bounce till i feel like the earth tilt

every club, dre and snoop loudest
g-funk, get it crunk like the dirty south
hold ya mouth, you ain't worth a third of me

a word from me, exclusive as a surgery
but i don't use a scalpel, chainsaw shoppin'

like that

whole staff'll come through and spin
either on the film or the two-inch wheel
behind the wheel of a sixty-four
i can't stop till i done fifty totes

y'all motherfuckers know me
i smoke a lot of weed, sayin' fuck a pass like kobe
