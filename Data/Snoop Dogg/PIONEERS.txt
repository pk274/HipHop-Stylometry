intensity’s not a perfume
actions speak louder than coaches
no matter what you assume
i’m prepared for whatever approaches
i am a champion, pioneer for the future ahead
i’m with the pantheon, better roll with a winner instead
the rеvolutions never steady rootеd but the goal at the end with a toast
vision without execution is just a hallucination at the most
i’m in it like jdt, sn double o p bout to kick it on fresh grass (yeah)
remember that no one is interested in your story till you win and go double the bag (grab)
all of those wins, don’t forget those losses, cause
they make those wins, feel better when talking
net games so gross
my foot works so ghost
live from the west coast
my verse so cold, that you gotta run it back
hit like instagram and post
