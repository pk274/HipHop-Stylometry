i just think, i think, and this me sayin' it from bein' in death row
and bein' on the outside, lookin' at y'all
i think y'all a better version of death row records
and that's, that's with no disrespect, that's with all respect
(i felt the best, yeah)
cause once you go... (like a blade to the side)
blood on the pavement, fallin', leaves it to dry
