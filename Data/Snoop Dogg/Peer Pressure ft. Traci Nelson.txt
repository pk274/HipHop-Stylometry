if i do if i don't if i will id i won't
i mix the c with the p and live the g with the funk
got you rapping at school my nigga acting a fool
he got suspended now he all alone in his room
playing my cd la da dee da dee
east side shit goldilocc and big trey d
on the 
baby girl wanna be grown
she got a facebook page and a cell phone
her daddy getting money her momma on the go
she moving too fast but she really don't know
life is a trip lil mama don't drink that
they telling you it's cool baby don't take that
cause if you do ain't no telling
you's a good girl why you fighting and rebelling
if you keep that up you gonna end up spread
misled better yet sick in the head
so stop trying to be like them and be yourself
stop look and see yourself
it's so real gotta stay hard in the paint
you can't fake baby put paint where it ain't
monkey see monkey do what i say i do
if i take one you take two


i'm up all night like i'm on twilight
turn left turn right your life my life
do wrong do right low life high life
i go green so why you keep offering me white
can't stop gotta go hard in the paint
can't fake nigga put paint where it ain't
monkey see monkey do what i say i do
if i take one you take two
