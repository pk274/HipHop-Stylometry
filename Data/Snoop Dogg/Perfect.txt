listen for this, the way that i lay down the shit that i do
like rapping, i'm maccing, i'm trapping, i'm acting, my bitch is your boo
my money and cars and jewellery and fame, that's all with the game
or really it's all about can you survive a drought when there's no rain
perfect, flip that shit, now work it
run these hoes like raining brothers, bitch, you in my circus
let this game surface, show you what your purpose
keep you on that right track and i help you keep your focus
now that you know what i am and i am what i say that i am
i say what i do and i did what i did, my nigga we fan
my bitches are stars, i meet 'em at bars, we sit and we chat
i give 'em this dick, they give me they money, as simple as that
