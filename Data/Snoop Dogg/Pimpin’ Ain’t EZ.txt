well it ain't
all them faces in that laker paint
casa by the lake

balling is what i does
i ain't messing with you can'ts
i'm a can do negro
a real life california hero
about six zeros at the end of the number in my bank account
nigga ain't ya mad at me
i'm so happy to see that you stopped your life to watch mine
yeah you see it fool
snoop's everywhere, italy i'm heavy there
did a show in rome like ho say you ain't never there
talking 'bout you popping bottles
i don't see none
you made it rain where?
i don't see a wand
go on get it off
that's what they like to hear
it's your money pimp
we don't fight it here
it's hard enough to be me
not trying to be you is someting i got to see
until then i'mma


this ain't a joke a loc made it look easy to you

and snoopy is your homie
nah nah girl he out of here
yeah he just act like he don't know me when he all up in here

though i don't condone faking for a bitch
don't call it pimping when you're bringing home the bacon to this bitch
go ahead and talk money

but know the deal you better flip her like a somersault
snoopy never played the role for which he wasn't built for
never called somebody friend that i wouldn't kill for
