let a motherfucker know from the get-go
came through the door slow with a four-four
limping, crimping and pimping, mixing ‘em all, fixin' the ball driftin', listen, dawg
my rap is that, my cadillac is drippin' wet
you can bet, turn it up, roll it up, burn it up
give it back to me, let me show you how to move that
groove that, weed that, do that
all in fallin’, ballin’, yellin’, doggy do that, chew that
record sales, whole sales, detail, retail
you fail, we sell, ding-dong, get your mama, ring your bell
back in the club with my nephew kelz
twenty-five girls in the dogg cartel
and they do what the dogg say, grifted or walkway
pimpin' on them all day, can’t you tell?
i’m likin' it, lovin' it, cubbin’ it, gubbin’ it
drinks up, blunts lit, platinum boss shit
nigga, you know how we do this


take it back in the back of the car
mac, mac like mackin' 'em hard
like dat, corps crackin' em hard
rich nigga with a platinum card in a platinum car
with mink on the seat, bones on her feet, hoes on the street 'cause they all wanna make that trip to the promised land
lil' mama can give it to me like i’m the man
give it to me like i told you
grab you, flip you, hold you, break you down
stop the press, drop your dress 'cause i’m gon’ take you down
what'd you think? i got drink and you want drink right now
two shots and now you ready for that, that now
and i’m gon’ give you that, i know that you giggin’ that
platinum smile on your face, yeah, they know i’m diggin’ that
and i’m likin' it, lovin' it, cubbin’ it, gubbin’ it
drinks up, blunts lit, platinum boss shit
you know how we do this
