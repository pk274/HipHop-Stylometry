it's kinda hard for a playa like you
but let me show you how a nigga like me get revenue
what you never do is punk out, what you better do
never let the game get ahead of you, get a better view
better yet, a better crew, praise god, i'm a marry you
get ya holy, carry you, bury you, slowly
roll me another blunt, stuff it
lick it, puff it, tuck it, fuck it
that man, that game, that thing it busts
in d-o-double-g we trust
yup, yup, young loc with the two steps
he creepin' with two tec's, they sleepin' with two chicks
right before we blast, all you heard was two clicks (bloaw!)
end of existence, for instance
rewind, replay it, re-chop it, remix it, re-twist it
goddamn, d-o-double-g, cuz, we missed it
travel slow, i'm an indian, but not a navajo
i smoke the big leaf, end all the big beefs
my hair in two braids, i'm the big chief
la-da-da, be-da-ba-da…
yeah, break that down, how fresh you are?
the king from queens, mr. escobar
connect with the best from the west, yes-yes, you are
oh my god, it's snoop dogg and nas; playa, play on
