pimp or die don't ask why
nigga that's just how we does
with mary jane in the game
you know cuz gon' stay buzz
don't flip out, trip out
just too quick
just let me hit your ass with some of this player shit
i once was in love with a girl named shail
she was 17 years old and bad as hell
i was 22 so i couldn't tell
cuz if her momma knew, i'd be threw in jail
well, it all went down like this
it started with a date and ended wit a kiss
next thing i know, i was diggin' her out
sneakin' into her house
sneakin' into my house
i choose you, and you choose me
if you use me, that's when you lose me
don't confuse me
i ain't that young ass, lower class
quick to blast nigga that you spit at during lunch time
i'm the equivalent to iceberg slim
gold dig, pretty toning, snoop called in on in
that's when my old pimp homies
pulled me to the side and this game is what he showed me
player, player say what you say
one more time just keep it divine
we got braids in our hair
we don't mind if you stare
the dress cold as the mold of a motherfucking player
beyotch
