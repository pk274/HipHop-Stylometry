hungry kids in the crib, ma
pocket like it's hot, pocket like it's hot, pocket like it's hot
when the craving's got a hold of you
pocket like it's hot, pocket like it's hot, pocket like it's hot
and your munchies get a attitude
pocket like it's hot, pocket like it's hot, pocket like it's hot
i got the pockets in my arms, settin' off smoke alarms
and i eat them smokin' hot cause i got it goin' on


i bring the heat, but y'all knew that
the big sauce boss, yeah i had to do that
i keep it fired up, even when i'm inside
you take what's mine, then you're gonna have to run and hide
