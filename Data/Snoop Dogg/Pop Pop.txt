now ever since the pandemic, nigga been on lockdown
when you see me movin', probably cruisin' with my top down
keep an exit plan, right hand for the knock out
dababy and the dogg, motherfuckers better watch out
doin' overtime for my grind, i never clock out (nope)
twenty-five thousand square feet for my rock house (yup)
vet her first, met her first, and let her burst
i got it poppin', four hoppin', niggas coppin' real estate up in my metaverse
