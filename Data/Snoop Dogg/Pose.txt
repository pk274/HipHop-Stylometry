head, shoulders, feet and toes
work that body, go on and pose
please the crowd, easy now
go ahead, baby girl, "cheese" and smile
she said, "mister, mister
would it be cool if i took a picture?" (picture)
to hang it on the wall with the rest of the best
i had her back in an hour or less
he say, she say, we say play
doggy dogg, take it easy
it's time to expose, i'll break off the rolls
now take off your clothes (do it)
get real close up under the light
and do that thing, show you're right
now close the doors
now you can really give it to me, go on, strike that pose


i know you like it
strike that pose
