snoop dogg, oh


it's just so tragic, just like magic
tragic, tragic, magic, problematic
one lonely kid on the block tryna be
cool as it can be, problematic boy he is
ain't nobody stopping 'cause he really don't listen
on the mission doing what he want, 'til he get in trouble
now he's on the bad side, problematic slowing down
better pay attention 'cause they ain't tryna play around
lay him down


break bread or fake dead
so problematic, ya dig?
oh, oh
