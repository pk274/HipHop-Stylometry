look up in the sky it's the fly
my herion whip, clip on hip, now trip on this
a bunch of outlaws try to take my town
set up shop, run me out, and cut me down
and how that sound?
when i'm the illest superhero
born and raised on that muthafucking underground
brrrrbrrrrbrrrr stick 'em, ha haha stick 'em
try to catch me slipping but now you 'bout to be my victim
i'm not aquaman but i aqua-boogie
i'm sorta like a monster, chasin' cookies
and i spin a web any size you can call me to fly
i walk walls and this is for all my dogs
(woof!)
i'm like the wonder twins, my style activates
the many niggas get in it and try to paper hate
it's fly, the rider man the rider man
i do it like a muthafucking rider and
i represent all the time and
i represent the mad ass fuckin' eastside
(eastside) -look out, look out, come out
cause here comes the rider man
(rider man), nigga
