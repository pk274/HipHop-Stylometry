watch your mouth never speak on what you not know
i'm from the west coast i turn his face into a pothole
15 deep niggas creepin' in the tahoe
let's see you act macho when i pull the burner on ya
sideways like a taco
rap niggas weak, all talk like a raldo
trunk full of cargo
dry like barstow
arsenal run up on 'em
get up on 'em
drill 'em with the clips
niggas gon' respect mine
i run this whole shit
crip rag in my pocket
three eighty on my hip
but back to this hip hop
who next on the list
gangstas don't kiss we get old and die rich
i smoke till i'm sleep
crush these niggas with my fist
your daddy was a coward you's a son of a bitch
so back to the glock with the infra-blue clip
we hit licks and gang bang
you on some t-pain shit
chop the pop and 20 crip
watch the flames hit his whip
then i'm back to the block shit
rock shit, hot shit
hit 'em in the chest
doggy run up in his pockets
misrepresenting sock him in his eye socket
i sat back and let you little niggas make your profits
nonsense, i'm watching, hoes out of pocket
you heard what they say
don't block it till you knock it
you stole my whole style
i'm 'bout to take you fools hostage
brrrah, bhrrrrah


from the looks to the hooks
i'm looking at these new niggas flippin' through my book
there's only one king
is you a pawn or a rook?
i got hand machine guns and soldiers on foot
so beef with me it's none
nigga down south, huh?
i throw a bullet at ya who gon catch it nigga duck
then send them goons at ya
turn your weapons into dust
you against me it's like trying to fight a bus
i'm at the bet awards sitting in disgust
it's still a +g thang+ but yet they wanna be us
they wanna be daz
they wanna be kurupt
cash on delivery money up front
yeah
bubble kush out a purple blunt
who's the best nigga circle one
snoop dogg
i'm large in the streets
my arms and my feets knee deep in the game
i'm the best on the beat
let you little niggas speak
and run for a treat
motherfuckin' geeks
all y'all niggas owe me until you rest in peace
and that's our d.p.g. motherfucka
