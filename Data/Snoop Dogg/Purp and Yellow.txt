swish, twenty-four, that's black mamba
snoop dogg, he’s a dope rhymer
collaborate with the golden state
in a yellow six deuce with the purple plates
i dip and dodge
i hit three and roll
fish and chips
bounce pass down to pau gasol
we don't give a damn about the big three
la lake show we bout to three-peat
and you can bet, that's on the set
ron artest about to get wet
i'm on the flo’ and thats a fact
sittin’ next to uncle jack blazin’ up the purple sack
