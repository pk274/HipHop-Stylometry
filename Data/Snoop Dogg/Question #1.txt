a nigga had the nerve to walk up on me ask me where i'm from
i told him i ain't bang, he didn't listen so i gave him one
not the cididy one, nigga try to hit him up
now you wanna get him up, set it up and wet it up
now from the hood, checking niggas on the daily
started off bg, og, baby
real live homie, two heaters in my seat
had to check a nigga at the compton swap meet
where you from? i don't bang
where you live? where you hang?
say the wrong thing, and bang
lights out, kites out to the homies in the pen
crippin' in the city, we ain't let the cuz in
a lot of niggas camouflage, try to blend in to fit in
get a hood rat so they set in
but if she got a brother, a daddy, or a cousin
they hit your ass up like motherfuckers, where you from, cuh?
