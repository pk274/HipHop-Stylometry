no pain, no gain, this life the same thang
been playin' so many games, gotta find a slow lane
sooner or later, no later, 'cause when he finally date her
you'll love her or either hate her, regroup or re'bilitate her
these are some real fly words from the wise one
i got my wife in my life, 'cause she's the right one
better know it, better show it, every time i step in
a real woman make a real man, and this is definite
yeah
