jump in the who ride, slide to the rhythm of
snoop d-o-double-g, a nigga from the dub
i represent it to the fullest everywhere i go
guaranteed to bust a ho, yeah, i'm so original
i don't have to, i told you from the get-go
i like to lay low with my niggas blowin' endo
we like to drink, talk shit, and spit at bitches
and that's the way we do it, sometimes we hittin' switches
in the lowrider slidin' to the hood and back
it's snoop dogg in the muthafuckin' cadillac
they call it snoop deville for real
i get the money and i never ever pop no pills
i used to pop 'em, i'm lyin' to these mothafuckaz now
i used to do all kind of shit when i was wild
they used to call me lil' bow wow, now i'm big bow wow
in this mothafucka bustin' a freestyle
snoop dogg is in the place to see
do it with my nephew, freddy d
ooh-wee, in the place to see
snoop d-o-double-g from the d.p.g.c
