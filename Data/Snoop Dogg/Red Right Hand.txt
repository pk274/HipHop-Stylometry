by the order of the peaky blinders
this is red right hand by snoop shelby
check it out


take a little walk to the edge of town
and go across the tracks
where the viaduct looms
like a bird of doom as it shifts and cracks
where the secrets lie in the border fires
in the humming wires, yeah
hey man, you know you're never coming back
i said you're never coming back
you know, you're never coming back
i said you're never coming back

so past the square, past the bridge
past the mills, now past the stacks
on another gathering storm
comes a tall handsome man
in a dusty black coat (say what?)
with a red right hand (say what, say what?)
did you hear what i said?
in a dusty black coat
with a red right hand


he'll wrap you up in his arms
tell you that you've been a good boy
he'll rekindle all the dreams it took you a lifetime to destroy
he'll reach deep into the hole
heal your shrinking soul
but there won't be a single thing that you can do
'cause he's a god
he's a god, he's a man
he's a ghost, he's a guru
they're whispering his name
through this disappearing land
but hidden in his coat
is a red right hand
yeah, red right hand


you don't have no money?
he'll get you some
you don't have a car? no car?
he'll get you one
you don't have no self-respect
you feel like an insect
well don't you worry buddy
'cause here he comes
through the ghettos and the barrios
and the bowery and the slums
a shadow is cast wherever he stands
stacks of green paper in his red right hand
stacks of green paper (yeah, money) in his red right hand


you'll see him in your nightmares
you'll see him in your dreams
he'll appear out of nowhere but
he ain't what he seems
you'll see him in your head
on the tv screen
and hey buddy, i'm warning you
turn it off
he's a ghost, he's a god
he's a man, he's a guru
you're one microscopic cog
in a catastrophic plan
designed and directed
directed, designed and directed
by his red right hand, yeah
red right hand
