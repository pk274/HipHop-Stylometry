when the background clears and you're the one left standin' there
you're runnin' out of time, you're prayin' that you make a hiss
whatever they do, whatever they do to you-you-you
whatever they say, whatever they say to you, you better
sound off in that paris
roll call in that lebanon
bandoleros in the mexico
can you hear me, the whole kingdom?
