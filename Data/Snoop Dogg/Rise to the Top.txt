this feel like a cocaine song, my bowl game strong
baby say my stroke game long
she on everything, move and choose up, who ya choosin'?
in it to win it, get it crackin', now how ya doin'?
maneuverin' while we movin'
smoky in this motherfucker while we crusin'
we off the coast of france with a host of friends
coastal winds get close again, you the most advanced
take my hand, go with the flow
do what i say and walk it out and pay attention
don't you give it away
and once we make that clear
i'ma tell you what you wanna hear, yeah
