cookies and milk
satin and silk
i'm chillin' in the living room, wrapped in a quilt
i'm waiting on this fat red suit-wearing comparing
my gifts to my home boy next door to me
a gift here, none there, but who cares
my little sister needs a comb just to braid her nappy hair
but here we go again waiting on the enemy
to slide down the chimney
look here, that ain't reality
