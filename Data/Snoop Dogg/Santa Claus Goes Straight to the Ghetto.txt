now on the first day of christmas, my homeboy gave to me
a sack of the krazy glue and told me to smoke it up slowly
now on the second day of christmas, my homeboy gave to me
a fifth of henn-dawg and told me to take my mind off that weed
now by the third day of christmas, my big homeboy gave to me
a whole lot of everything, and it wasn't nothin' but game to me


santa claus (ooh-ooh-ooh, don't get too close because you might get shot)
is coming straight to the ghetto (welcome to the ghetto)


santa claus on the ceiling, jack frost chillin'
pinch the grinch for being a holiday villain
season's greetings, all the proceedings
are brought to you by the church house where we'll be eatin'
chestnuts roastin' on a open fire
singin' my jingle, where is kris kringle?
i didn't pout and i ain't even shouted
i even stayed in the house when the homies tried to sneak me out
and all i want for christmas is my six-four chevrolet
and a granddaughter for her grandmother beverly
ain't that somethin'? (uh-huh) nah, ain't that nothin'
how it's christmas time and my rhyme's steady bumpin'
everybody happy (happy), hair still nappy
gonna steal a gift for my old grandpappy
catch me giving out turkeys at the church house
don't try to work me, just stand in line and everything gon' be fine
holla at ya folks, boy, it's goin' down
ain't no help from no elves, just tha dogg pound
and we passin' out gifts, blazin' up spliffs
christmas on the row, can you dig it? (can you dig it?)


we wish you a happy new year
we wish you a happy new year
we wish you a happy new year
we wish you a happy new year
