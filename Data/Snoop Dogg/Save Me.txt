not trying to say i lived perfectly
but i'm saying i do believe
that through ups and downs, don't help around
they keep trying to kick me down, but i have the answer
dear god, i wonder, can you save me?
they can say what they want 'bout me (i don't care what they say about me)
i know who i'm destined to be
one day, they'll see (they're gonna see it)
they'll wish they could be
on the other side, and they'll wish they knew the answer
dear god, i wonder, can you save me?
