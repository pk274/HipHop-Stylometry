i am over here
looking at you
you are over there
watching me too
both painting pictures of
of how we'll kiss and ahh
so what we gon' do?
(so what you gon' do, what you gon' do?)
tell me why we're standing here (someone tell me, tell me)
the moment's fresh and so sincere
you got my mind blown
and baby, i'm ready to go (hey)
but uh...


(let's make it)
hot as you can stand it
somethin' like volcanic
you and me seems organic
just like the stars and planets
yeah, we are
so what you gon' do?
(so what you gon' do, what you gon' do?)
tell me why we're still in here (someone tell me, tell me)
there's nothing for us to fear
i can tell it with my eyes closed
and baby, i'm ready to go (let's roll, hey)
but uh...


every time i fall though
want me to speak on a word or two
it's the d o double g
and i do it, so lovely
diggin' this track by the neptunes
babygirl, follow me to the rest room
now get buck wild
shh... don't make a sound
i'll take you, lay you down
make your body go 'round and 'round
do you want to?
don't say you won't, i know you do
most girls play shy
it won't hurt until you give it a try
i know you like my smile, dig my style
big bow wow (but uh...)
