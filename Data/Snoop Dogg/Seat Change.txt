playa, play ya, lay ya, spray ya
on the real, loco, i should be the mayor
compassionate writer, fly to a spider
scope on me tough like a sniper, viper
my cipher is g's, no fleas, green trees
no seeds, oh please, we press, we ease
artistically in a midst of me, i'm mystically and magical
the weight i form the group
makes a move i mean, cause my shit is like classical
it blows my mind and i know, this new diamond i quote
it's worth about a meal ticket, baby
is ya down to come get it?
cause my seat is unoccupied
west coast living, is you down to ride?
we can take ya to the spot maybe, but it's hot baby
from the bottom all the way to the top, baby
you with the boss dogg, that it is
see, i'm 'bout the currency with urgency, can ya dig?
