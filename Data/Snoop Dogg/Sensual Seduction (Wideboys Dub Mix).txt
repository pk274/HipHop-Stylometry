i'm gonna take my time
she gon’ get hers before i
i'm gonna take it slow
i'm not gonna rush the stroke


so she can get a sensual seduction
so i can get a sensual seduction
so we can get a sensual seduction
so i can get a sensual seduction, whoa, whoa


approached the chick with the real pretty face
nice curves on her with a little bitty waist
i whispеred in her ear, "lil’ mama, what you drink?
i know that you'rе a freak but you know that i ain't gon' say shh"
see my game is outrageous
i got her to the crib and exchanged some love-faces
but it wasn't no need for me to rush to bust one
'cause i wanted her to have an eruption


bust-bust-bust-bust one
bust-bust-bust-rush to bust one
sensual seduction
bust-bust-bust-bust one
bust-bust-bust-r-rush to bust one
sensual seduction


i was all in da club, havin' a drink, blowin' on a sweet
when i peeped this little freak out
i was all in the bar, wind drift up, shawty redd came on
then she hit the floor, now
with a see through dress, long hair, light brown eyes
lookin’ like miss bo peep
and a playa know if i take her home, with them real thick hips
you so right i’m gon' beat
so i approached the chick with the real pretty face
nice curves on her with a little bitty waist
i whispered in her ear, "lil’ mama, what you drink?
i know that you're a freak but you know that i ain't gon' say shh"
see my game is outrageous
i got her to the crib and exchanged some love-faces
but it wasn’t no need for me to rush to bust one
'cause i wanted her to have an eruption


bust-bust-bust-bust one
bust-bust-bust-rush to bust one


sensual seduction, sensual seduction
sensual seduction, sensual seduction
sensual seduction
so i can get a sensual seduction
so we can get a sensual seduction
so i can get a sensual seduction, whoa, whoa
