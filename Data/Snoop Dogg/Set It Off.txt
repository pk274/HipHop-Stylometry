i am doggy dogg bitch (beitch) love to hit a switch
never hit a bitch (beitch) love that gangsta shit
can i hear your flow? can i fuck yo' ho?
boy you hard on 'em - nigga you ain't know?
when you testify, you got to keep it fly
a lot of niggas lie, shit we do or die
e'ryday we high, it's like a nine to five
i got my nina my fo'-heata beata by my side
i keep it tucked close when i'm on the west coast (west coast)

lock you up and fuck you up
talk shit to you beat you down then cuff you up
and leave you in a cell stuck (damn!)
