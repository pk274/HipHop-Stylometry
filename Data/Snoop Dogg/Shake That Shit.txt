now all the ladies in the place with the style and grace
small waist, big booties with the pretty face
i love it how you wizzork, tight mini-skizzirt
do it 'til it hizzurt, invited to the chizzurch
tell all your friends that the dog's in the louie
i bet a hundred dollars that they all wanna do me
foxx is a cutie, better yet a beauty
rolling with the house, yours truly
can i get a shot of the plizzo, before the bar clizzos
take you to the plizzad, lay you on the flizzoor
two for the money and one for the shizzow
keep it on the low, here we go, here we gizzo
