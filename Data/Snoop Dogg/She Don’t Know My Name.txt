hmm, she say them suckers agitate her, told her i'm a regulator
man i wanna lay down witcha, maybe we can do it later
i ain't got no time to waste, another move i got to make
cold thang, she ain't even know my nizzame (damn)
i didn't even have to say it, baby wanna stop and play it
rewind that, pop and grind that
you'll find that, a woman like yourself can't keep cumin' by yourself
get in where you fit in, now enjoy yourself
cute brightskin brownskin take me to the mountain
get you wet like a fountain
then get your counselin, have a seat, have a drink, have a toke
it's a doggy dogg world, you can have whatever you want
or whatever you need, all you got to do it follow my lead
take my hand, and roll with me
and live it up, with a d-o-double-g, lavishly
