yeah, ayo, swizz
what up, man?
we're just sitting there reminiscin', man
rock this lil' wuwop
what we should be doing, nigga, used to have, man
yeah, it's all in the past
mmm, mmm


say you with your girlfriend shopping at the mall
but really you was at the pad, bouncing basketballs
and i do it all, seen it all, but i wasn't even trippin', dawg
i'ma sip this zippin', dawg, i'm on something different, dawg
took me for a fool
wasn't 'bout no money or no car or no jewels
why do fools fall in love?
and do think i wasn't trippin', cuz
and then i ended up slippin' up
yeah, i couldn't get enough


g's don't fall in love, that's what they told me, cuz
now if it's true or not, if it's you or not
we stayed up for a few days, we layed up for a few days
it became a workout, then we started doing two things
you started actin' weird on it, on the real, homie
and then she slipped away and disappeared on me
and told a lie at the same time
and had my heart in her hand, and i ain't even lying
