ya i don't know why you treat me so motherfuckin bad
you ain't gonna realize whats you got till its gone, thats real
you gets no lovin, babe


girl you know i got you livin plush in the cut
and every time i wanna dig you out
you tell me "don't rush"
money stashin, you got me sneakin
and we all alone in the zone, i be tweakin
i almost got caught, my game is leaking
i had to stay at my daddy's house, on the couch last weekend
it's written on my face, and i can't even hide it
so i decided, to ride it
roses are red, and violets are blue
girl you got a nigga hooked, when you do whatcha do when ya do
and now ya want a benz for ya birthday
and i been waitin to hit that ass since the first day
i'm buyin you gifts, draping you out, with gold
i'm showin you love, you's above any other hoe
tattoo wit my name on your tits
and everytime i dip, i make sure to kick some chips
now bitch trip


you don't show me some love
show me love, for real, you gets no love, yeah
you gets no loving, babe
you gets no love, you ain't gonna miss it 'til it's gone
you don't show me some love
show me love, for real, you gets no love, yeah

you gets no love, you ain't gonna miss it 'til it's gone


and that's on us, and i trust you won't bust under pressure
and i ain't even trip, when you dip wit them chips off the dresser
and you didn't even have to fess up
i just gave you another g, and told you "pick ya dress up"
for the weddin, the settin was set
40 g's for your ring, you's a queen sippin moet
i'm upset, and i don't even want to have jip out
but baby didn't give it to me, ughh
i was down at the alter, i seen sister salta
said "lady could you pray for me?" ughh
i'm in a love affair, i can't share, it ain't fair
because my life is my wife, and that ain't right
cause i'm a do what i'm suppose to do, and what i was choose to do
whether it's buyin a house, or car, or some clothes for you
i try to stay true to it, see i ain't new to it
that's why i do for you boo, i need love too, three


you don't show me some love
show me love, for real, you gets no love, yeah
you gets no loving, babe
you gets no love, you ain't gonna miss it 'til it's gone
you don't show me some love
show me love, for real, you gets no love, yeah
you gets no loving, babe
you gets no love, you ain't gonna miss it 'til it's gone


see i done put it on the line, see this here is genuine
an as long as you with me girl, see everything is gonna be fine
see can't nobody match it, don't touch it, ya might scratch it
this love affair, it's so original, i call it classic
see i'm attracted, an i'm infatuated
at the same time, elated, and gang related, dogg pound on mine
but to find time to leave all that behind
and try to spend some time and give you all of mine {what's that} ya see
i ain't hard to get along with, to do a song with a nigga like d.j. pooh
dedicate this whole thing, to a girl like you, boo, look here
you know i'm true, just continue to do me like you want me to do you
and, i hope we don't never have to, write another chapter
just keep it on the real wit me
cause i don't really wanna, see you on the corner
just show a nigga love ya see {gets no love, gets no love}


you don't show me some love
show me love, for real, you gets no love, yeah
you gets no loving, babe
you gets no love, you ain't gonna miss it 'til it's gone
you don't show me some love
show me love, for real, you gets no love, yeah
you gets no loving, babe
you gets no love, you ain't gonna miss it 'til it's gone
