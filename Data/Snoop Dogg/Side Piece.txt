yes i'm the most high
baby want it, mimosa
i tried to reverse her, a mentirosa
got me livin' the vida loca in acapulco
with my pictures on the wall on a poster, a roller coaster
so i try to dance my life away to get it over
i'm sippin' jameson with famous friends until i'm sober
don't wanna go home, i know i'm gonna get into a fight
i called my sidepiece and tell her i'mma spend the night
and if she out of town, baby we' gon' book a flight
she got it laid out with incense and candlelights
your shit's on hit, officially lit
you're tryna get a nigga sprung, your pussy wet, you lil bit
you have no idea, what? you want me right here?
are you sure that we can do this shit right here?
cause if it's on like that, i'll spend the night here

good love, good sex and good weed
baby oil to rub down my sleeves, relax and breathe
red wine, crackers and cheese, baby shootin' the breeze
while aiming to please
oh please, don't stop with the antics
high heels, t-shirts, no panties
me knockin', she's rockin' the boat
while baking me a cake with a root beer float
then put the tv on the channel where's it's nothin' but sports
every room at the house is where i smoke my dope, no joke
got keys to the spot so i can slide by necessary
mary, mary, quite crip contrary
apartment contemporary
jo malone candles, very airy
ain't that right siri? (that's right siri)
so keep sendin' that right
the way it's lookin', i'll be spendin' the night
