los angeles, valley-o
oakland, long beach, the bay
niggas gettin' money all day every day
trunk thumb, marache
her titties bounce, i blow a ounce
large amounts, of niggas pounds
unannounced, at ya door
snoop dogg, sho dogg and 40-o
westward hoe, this ain't our first rodeo
i know, half these niggas suspect
ruff-neck had to go and get a blood check
nigga fuck your pills and your high-heels
i see you stumblin', and you mumblin'
oh brother (oh brother), remember there's only one step from the limo to the gutter
mutherfucker, i drive off and burn rubber, as the ghetto bird hover
remember, i keep it one thousand, with the homies at the top of the mountain


a million big faces in the bag and still countin'
with a gang of niggas waitin' on the album
still dippin' with the top down, banging that westmore
the best four, niggas we can talk about them
while i'm slidin' in my old school ride, chromed-out, front back side to side (lean back smoke a...)
take one token, chocke
hit it again, i'm fitted to win, my niggas on ten (on ten)
the nigga within will take your bitch and wiggle it in
and ickle her friend with dick on her chin, but
i ain't trippin', but i ain't slippin', i wear my own clotches designed to crip in
nowadays niggas hardly listen (hardly listen), so fuck around and get that ali whippin'
i keep a stick and a sticky on me
and on the averge i keep a bad bitch, droppin' 50 on me
big place, smoking state to state
turn it up and let the trunk vibrate
we the greats, it's not up for debate
turn it up and let the trunk vibrate
this is for my niggas from los angeles, valley-o
oakland, long beach (yes sir), the bay
niggas gettin' money all day every day
