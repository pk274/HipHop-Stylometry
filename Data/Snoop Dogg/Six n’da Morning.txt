that's what she said when she came up out my bed
little bad bitch i met her from my homie fred
her baby daddy locked up doing time with the feds
now she on the streets a cold freak, and a molly head
i'm lying y'all, i think i'm probably dead
but i don't give a fuck, and she don't give a shit
so we gon' keep on fuckin', she suckin' my dick
after hours and both of us are drunk as a bitch
so we headed to the hookah bar
man i'm chilling like a superstar
and i'm burning them right
and we up in this bitch until they turn on the lights
ya dig?
