somebody's gettin' my love
somebody's beatin' it up


we went from nothin' to somethin'
we went from down to up
we went from rags to riches (say it ain't so)
bad times, good times
the big house and the fancy cars
drivin' all around with big movie stars
tell me, do you love him, baby?
does he freak? does he drive you crazy?


somebody's gettin' my love
somebody's beatin' it up
say it ain't, say it ain't so
sleepin' in my bed (sleepin' in my bed), sleepin' in my bed (sleepin' in my bed)
baby, said you love me, you said there'll never be (never be)
so we put our thing together, now we family
sleepin' together, stayin' together, good and bad weather
tougher than leather, we still writin' love letters
never could i ever betray you, say you do the same
but soon as i leave town, you change the game
i can't lie, it's a crying shame
that you lie in vain in my bed with that mayne
stuck for words, you can't even explain
how your pleasure caused me so much pain
it's your loss and my gain, 'cause i'm a player in this game
and i can't do a damn thing but maintain - bang


somebody's sleepin' (somebody's beatin' it up)
in my bed, in my bed
somebody's gettin' my love
somebody's beatin' it up
somebody's gettin' my love, somebody's beatin' it up
somebody's gettin' my love
somebody's beatin' it up
somebody's gettin' my love, somebody's beatin' it up
somebody's beatin' it up
