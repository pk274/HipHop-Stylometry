slow down, i can't take the heat
slow down, it's wicked in these streets
slow down, i can't take the heat
slow down, it's wicked in these streets


life ain't nothing but a big old twist
a lot of times when i'm smoking, i'm doing that just to reminisce
it's funny, on how shit be
a lot of money, make y'all wanna come get me
but look here, i work hard for all the things i got
and to hang with a niggas just an intricate plot
you smoke my weed, you try to bang my hoes
and talk bad about a nigga, behind closed doors
but look here, dog, a ho once told me loc
bite the hand that feeds you, and you'll wind up broke
bitch niggas don't deserve to kick it
with rich niggas, nigga we seven figure niggas
and we bigger than the biggest hip hop, niggas of rap
and when we get to spittin', make sure y'all step back
you with that? cause if you ain't clown
we from the d-o double g, we groupie true and slow down


slow down, i can't take the heat
slow down, it's wicked in these streets
slow down, i can't take the heat
slow down, it's wicked in these streets


slow down, i can't take the heat
slow down, it's wicked in these streets
slow down, i can't take the heat
slow down, it's wicked in these streets


i got niggas, shot niggas, drop niggas for fun
i swap from these shoulders, i don't need no gun
but it's the 90's and niggas don't bump by the end of the round
the clown bound to dump, young chump
you don't wanna get caught up in the mix
cause i'm a soldier, blasting at the rollers, bitch
we don't, never ever, talk no shit
unless we back that shit up, nigga you get lit up


slow down, i can't take the heat
slow down, it's wicked in these streets
slow down, i can't take the heat
slow down, it's wicked in these streets


slow down i can't take the heat
slow your roll, tuck your heat and watch the haters
slow down i can't take the heat
slow your roll, tuck your heat and watch the haters
