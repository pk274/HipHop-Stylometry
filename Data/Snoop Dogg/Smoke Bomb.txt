hands up, now twist your fingers
on the set momma raised a banger
every hood do the same stuff
and then they came up when they name up
with a bunch of hard heads like
biggie poppa, warren g, and lil' half dead
rectified, don't run up on a nigga or your neck will fly
back in your lap click-clack get back (back-back)
