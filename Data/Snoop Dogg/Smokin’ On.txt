let me turn you on and turn you out
to make you feel like you really wanna feel
for real, show will, nigga, i got that kilo
you know what i got:
captain crunch, soda pop
light green kush cut from a bush
mix it together, get it together
hypo grow with the hydro flow
smoking on some shit called i don't know
this is that shit that was caught
from my niggas on the block with a .44 glock - oh no!
cuttin' it up, button it up
homie don't speak at all
you might 'scape, you might be most likely like shark bait
i might hate, nigga, you smoking that lightweight
wrong class, featherweight, levitate
set it straight: let me break it down for you
flip it, zip it, let it fly
if it's good, it's gonna get you high
drop it, stop it, that ain't the one
we don't even smoke that shit for fun!
