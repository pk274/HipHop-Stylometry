baby, i'm just a man with good hands like allstate
and you are now addicted to this lovin'
let me explore your love 'cause my time is short today
and now you're conflicted, and this is what she had to say


(ah, i need you right back to me, snoopy)

oh baby, i wish i had time to stay and play but
(snoopy, don't go, ooh, ooh)

(snoopy, don't go, ooh, ooh)
'cause my time is precious, you dig?


baby, i got to go far away for a while
