hold on dogg, what now huh? - how you feel?
yeah, shit's gettin' bad before your boy got steel
not gettin' kneel, watch yourself cause it's ill
home boys kill home boys and that's real
the hardest niggas who tell ya
when you're in jail, you're a motherfuckin' failure
with no one to bail you, they'll sell you every bang
except the game, to stay on the top of the game
remember the homeboy with the flossy rings
where he at? - just homies took him up out the game
it's a cold game
but you got to know, when you're ended, it's a cold shame
if you're gettin' barred, you got to stay stand
and do what you got to do, to get in
every since, i put my hands in this dirty rap game
look here, i've been on this mission tryin' get the scratch, man


so what, so what, so whatcha want?
so what, so what, so whatcha want?
so what, so what, so whatcha want?


so what, so what, so whatcha want?
so what, so what, so whatcha want?
so what, so what, so whatcha want?
