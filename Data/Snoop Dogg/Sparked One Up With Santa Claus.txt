we got so high on christmas eve
no one else got presents but me
you know santa likes his christmas trees


kick up your feet, take a rest
he said "this christmas stuff has got me so stressed"
i know the thing that'll do the trick
santa baby come and take one hit


we got so high on christmas eve
no one else got presents but me
you know santa likes his christmas trees


the fire is slowly dying
the reindeer are so so tired
outside my sleigh is waiting
but santa is way too faded
what a christmas eve


yeah she did
what a christmas eve
i've got so many places to be and so many people to see
all these kids want their gifts
what time is it? 11:59?
i only got one minute? oh wow
