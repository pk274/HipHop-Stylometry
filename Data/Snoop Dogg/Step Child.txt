you know, in life, i come to find out that
there's a little bit of good, little bit of bad in everything
it's always some good people, always some bad people
perfect example: i know some good gangbangers and some bad gangbangers
i know some good police officers and some bad police officers
so the moral of the story is, we gots to get some motherfuckin' understanding
or else


all frowns, no smiles, no more black on brown
let's get togethеr and show 'em how we get down
i hеard payback's a motherfuckin' nigga
that's why i'm sick of gettin' treated like a goddamn step child


all frowns, no smiles, no more black on brown
let's get together and show 'em how we get down
i heard payback's a motherfuckin' nigga
that's why i'm sick of gettin' treated...


all frowns, no smiles, no more black on brown
let's get together and show 'em how we get down
i heard payback's a motherfuckin' nigga
that's why i'm sick of gettin' treated like a goddamn step child


all frowns, no smiles, no more black on brown
let's get together and show 'em how we get down
i heard payback's a motherfuckin' nigga

it may be time to let it burst
but first we gotta treat each other better first then get reimbursed
yeah, we need a bag, big bag for our sweat and tears
back pay, this owed for the last 400 years
third generation soldier
g-pops and pops served their time overseas, mines was on the corner
fightin' for the blue, goin' against the red
while the white part sittin' around collectin' all the bread
we can fight they wars but they won't fight for us
they gentrified everything so now they right with us
yeah, next door neighbors askin' for favors
actin' tense 'cause they unsure of our natural behavior
thinkin' that we want revenge 'cause the way they enslaved us
but we peaceful, y'all the ones labeled us dangerous
like we threw 'em in them cages for not knowin' how to act
it's like the pot callin' the kettle black, y'all niggas crazy
you want me to stop talkin' like this? well, nigga, make me
they control the cash money so they think they baby
try to silence nick for what he read out a book they wrote
hmm, ain't that a slippery slope?
that's why i question everything that that history wrote
time to repair everything that that history broke
hit the clutch, get in gear, one foot on the gas
the other foot way deep in they ass, you understand me?


all frowns, no smiles, no more black on brown
