recognize game when it's in your face
one thing about me and these trees
we have an unbreakable bond
we're connected from the roots to the seeds, to the leaves, to the trees
feel me, please
we plan to disperse to the earth
what is it worth
whether you're last, whether you're first
from the date of your birth
we smoke trees cause trees was delivered from the earth
dig that
see a lot of y'all don't know
so said snoop dogg
flatbush zombies
blaze one for the nation
