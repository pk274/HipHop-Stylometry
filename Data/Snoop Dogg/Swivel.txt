i can send a missile
i got my head on a swivel, swivel
i got my head on a swivel
eyes peeled when i wiggle
i got my head on a swivel, swivel
i got my head on a swivel
this is not a starter pistol (no, no)
i got my head on a swivel, swivel (yeah)
i got my head on a swivel
if you need me just whistle
i got my head on a swivel, swivel
i got my head on a swivel


from the depths of the sea
blowing trees in the big leagues
i got a plan, i'm going ham on all you dbs
you better double me up, safety cover me up
single coverage won't work boy, i'll burn him up
give me the damn ball, move the chains at the same time
dressed to impress when it's game time, flame mine
i'm wide open, hoping, scoping out the scene
catch a quick screen, cake walk on your whole team
will he beam, will he run,  will he walk, talk, or will he lean
i need riders and goons when i build a team
i get it cracking with the snap of the wrist
it's nothing less than a championship, now peep this


call a few plays then break the huddle
check that d, they in the zone no rebuttal
i can throw a strike down the pipe about 80
hand full of rings, i'm shady like brady

i'm in full beast mode, too cold to be cut down
lifting weights, staying in shape, won't be shut down
antonio brown or julio jones
one on each side, now who do you zone
they on me like a bloodhound cause i won't go down
it's like a merry-go-round the way i'm bending my routes
i'm so sick with this, they can't stick me
stick to to this
sports illustrated, get a flick of this
lost him, cross him, quarterback toss
highest point homie had the randy moss him
one hand as i shook him off me
some obj with a dab of that dj coffin, get off me


call a few plays then break the huddle
check that d, they in the zone no rebuttal

if you play wing back, slot end, or receiver
you got to outwork your opponent or you won't receive a
pass from the quarterback cause he's under pressure
they get a couple 1db's about to press up
looking apart from the start, on the dress up
coach on the play, i'm hoping that he don't mess up
ayy back up off me, you playing me close
you bout to be hot buttered on a breakfast toast
i rock it out and find my way into the endzone
a couple cheerleaders want to be in my friendzone
i tell 'em "cool," i keep my head in the game
cause i'm ahead of the game and i'm a veteran man
