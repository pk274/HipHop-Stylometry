you came with your friend but she fat as fuck
and nann one of my homies wanna fuck, and now she wanna front
from the get-go i figured this is how it gon' be
tell that little punk bitch that you ridin' with me
don't stop, fo' hop
hollywood hills back to too $hort's spot
you wanna roll, let's get ghost and jet
i wanna see if i can make you wet
'cause you need it, let me beat it
your lil' fat friend, actin' conceited
sittin' in the corner; leave her, the bitch is a loner
dancin', givin' me a boner (ooh, mmm)
i pull a pole on out
me and you, boo, we need to roll on out
you sit here, in the bed where
a nigga just wanna put the head in, biatch
