i've been trying to develop an alternative fuel from a mix of all natural substances
but the mix was highly volatile until we found a catalyst
to help stabilize the compound and supercharge the fuel
i'm sorry, what was this magical catalyst?
marijuana, motherfucker!
uh, ladies and gentlemen, players and playettes, teachers, staff, and students
i am very honored to welcome you to the high school annual talent show
brought to you by the makers of wiz khalifa premium rolling papers
and the qualified growers of snoop dogg master kush
so without further a due let's get this show on the road
first contestant bring your talent to the foreground and let your smoke be the background


i go green like i was arch bishop don juan
and blow circles around you suckas like a marathon
my gym teacher told me but i didn't listen
my bitch did my homework and now i'm in detention
it should be suspension, this is my audition
so play your position, get the picture i envision
did she mention; snoop dogg was made for kissing
a barracuda fishing, she on a mission for me
pleasure, pain, and glory in my inventory
my sats my little bitch she did 'em for me
and now we prancing on stage at the talent show
we flossing, my clothes, my chain, and my knapsack
full of that, hand me that, can you see my telescope
principal say she want to see me cause she smell my smoke
'bout my money, tripping even if i fold it wrong
blowing zones with wiz because this is the protocol
