you thought it was gone, but it's on once again
light up the chronic, while i take a couple of sips of the gin
if it, if it dre (uh huh) if it, if it snoop (uh huh)
back on track as we roll like a 7-8 coupe
de ville, you chill on the funk cut
guess what? (what up?)
we still loccin' up
so those who oppose will get smacked up nicely
by the smooth macadamian who's awfully sheisty
some thinking that i would switch, but i’m never to ever switch
still clockin' the grip and i give a fuck about a bitch, baby
i gotta have it you see, and so does my diggy-dog
the motherfucking doctor d-r-e


i'm still saucin
cause i'm the boss and
say they flossin'
cause it’s compton
every baddest bitch who wants to get broke off
thats how i do it, get into it
with the fluid, and i thought you knew it
doing it like this and doing it like that
and, uh, when it comes to gats the nine has to know i'm rastlin
why try to put up a fight when i can just grab my chrome and put it to your dome?
only make ya thank, so before you try to gank
would you ask your stank about my bank or ya strength
(the 1-5-1)
cause that's what you're dealing with
my 9 double-m, that's what i kill 'em with
if you keep coming at the doc like he's (crazy)
fucking with snoop, you’ll be pushing up daisies
niggas who talk shit really don't (faze me)
cause ain't nothing but a 'g' thang (baby)


now gs, not bgs, but ogs
"what about the women snoop?" bitch, please
i ain't got time to be pent up for a ho
even if she giving up dough
yo ho, no
(baby)
your love is so out of reach
you must've forgot that i was born and raised in long beach
where the hoes come a dime a dozen
you start fronting on the pussy then i fucked your cousin
i ain't buzzin'
i'mma get mine straight up
i'm still doggy dogg, so what would i have to wait if knowin they ho'in
throwin' the pussy at a nigga like me
cause i’m shakin' ‘em, bakin’ ‘em, takin’ ‘em, fakin’ ‘em
makin 'em brake they selves, g
and your pooh-butt nigga bet' not trips
so you know i got a grip on my shit
and i'll bust a cap if he approaches me
just to let him see how a real motherfuckin' g
can turn into murderer with just one switch
die try to throw up for your ugly-ass bitch
now you're put to rest and there's no coming back
as i groove in my life just to show you where it's at
so get a glimpse of a pimp who kicks back
it's still like this and like that (hell yeah)
and you say that i'm crazy
but ain't nuthin' but a 'g' thang baby
