we do this in our sleep, nigga

i wanna holla at you, ma
you know it's hard for a player to admit that sometimes
but i'ma spit that sometimes, y'know what i'm sayin?
ayy, p, give it to me one time nephew


there's something 'bout this girl man, from around my way
she from around the way
ever try to hold back your feelings, but it just wouldn't stay
it wouldn't stay, wouldn't stay
but when i finally found the words to say
i wanted to run away (run away, run away), simply run away, oh
you can try to run and hide, it won't make a difference
you can lie to yourself, let me reason
sure it hurts when it comes to your attention
that you're in love with the girl


what you say, say, say?
but when i finally found the words to say
i wanted to run away (run away, run away), simply run away, oh
check it out, check it out
you can try to run and hide, it won't make a difference
you can lie to yourself, let me reason
sure it hurts when it comes to your attention
that you're in love with the girl


see i'm a crip in dark blue chucks
and i does what i does yeah i might say "cuz"
it's really weird cause a nigga got love
snoop dogg's a crip and the girl was a blood
she told me that her baby daddy was a thug
now it is what it is and it was not was
i'm hollerin' at lil mama like what
monday morn stack tryna get my cheese back
all these memories breed seed to the rhythm rhyme pleaser
lay back while we sippin' on a breezer
fresh four pack sittin' in the freezer
ain't that kadija i heard she was a skeezer
she used to hit them licks wit' the visas
when i seen her wit the homies i was like "jesus"
it's been a little minute since i seen her
hope her man don't run up cause i'll have to pull the nina
