snoopy
is what they say as if they knew me
groupies, on my head like a cufi
my nigga kid cudi, that's my little buddy
call some hoes up, and get some cutty cutty
what's your life like? mine's is kinda tight
a long way from hustlin', that china white
my people love me, the fans love me, i'm all go
if you ain't showin' love, then what you call for?
i don't need it in my life, my kids pay the price
so alike and in need of my wife
smoke 'til i'm gone, dogg on the throne
i'm world-wide known, i'm a boss in the zone
i get it how i get it 'cause i can, i earn my spot
you see the plan, i'm just fuckin' with my fans
i turnеd out to be the bettеr man, important to life
you understand while i'm puffin' on this gram
