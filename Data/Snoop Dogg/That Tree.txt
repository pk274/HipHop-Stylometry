snoopy
is what they say as if they knew me
groupies, on my head like a cufi
my nigga kid cudi, that's my little buddy
call some hoes up, and get some cutty cutty
what's your life like? mine's is kinda tight
a long way from hustlin', that china white
my people love me, the fans love me, i'm all go
if you ain't showin' love, then what you call for?
i don't need it in my life, my kids pay the price
so alike and in need of my wife
smoke 'til i'm gone, dogg on the throne
i'm world-wide known, i'm a boss in the zone
i get it how i get it 'cause i can, i earn my spot
you see the plan, i'm just fuckin' with my fans
i turned out to be the better man, important to life
you understand while i'm puffin' on this gram


can't forget it, they made me who i am, a king
and i'm still on the scene, you gotta love it
all out in public, the people want to touch it
i need a blunt with the stuffin'
nigga, it's nothin' for me to chill out, post up at the house
with madden on the screen, and smash on the homies
hollywood nice now, everybody on me
and on the blogs talk shit like they know me, hm
aww fool, take you niggas to school
"how to get rich and stay cool"
snoopy d o dub, show you homie, even with the critics
and the feds all on me, i was tappin' all the chonies
dogg, but my folks call me snoopy
boss dogg, nigga sue me
pony tail swangin' as i lay in the jacuzzi
love of my life, while i'm puffin' on the oww wee, kush
