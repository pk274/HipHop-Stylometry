from the bottom to the top, top to the bottom
i’m gone get with ‘em while i still got ‘em
i’ll rock this ?? ’til it turn to a boulder
my game gettin’ colder and colder
man, you better realize, and keep your eyes on the prize
only the strong survive, on my side
game to the youngstas, peep game
snoop dogg is the name, dogg pound is the gang
i’ma twist it, so listen
death row, o.f.t.b., dpg
on a mission, to the t-o-p
from the bottom, baby b, can’t you see, ??
‘cause that’s the ?? you gots to peep the styles
i wish i knew then what i know now
but i don’t ?? so i can’t fake the funk (fake the funk, fake the funk)
wack rappers on the mic, shall i kill ‘em?
damn right, if you claim the wrong set you better tell ‘em
