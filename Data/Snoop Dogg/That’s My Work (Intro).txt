on the real cuz flip this, trip this
nigga try to introduce me to my bitch
on the turf, i ain't drip saw the full dirt
casanova, lavert, revert
back with another hit, better get another bitch
she's so playful, that bitch ain't faithful
cus' i can name five different times
when the bitch went for hers, so i'm gonna get mine
i got four 'lacs, 5 chevrolets, what it do
even got a bulletproof, i'm tied in with the upper echelon

sucker punch, i don't think so
well what do you know? when i pulled up, a little yellow bitch stood up
i threw the hood up
you know why?

work, work (that's my work)
work, work (that's my work)
