snoop dogg
mercury, def jam

return of the m-a-c-c-c-c


i got keys to whatever, trees of endeavour
mann, he is buzzin', he's on my level
he’s on the pedal, drive off slow
seven deuce cadillac, it’s convertible
she wanna be with a mack in his hands
dogg in the house, while i'm crankin’ it back
they say, we say, you say dogg
take it to the top, now drop it down low
mink on my back, suited and booted
cripped out, pimped out
what would you do if you was me?
would you hop on a freak while you bop to the beat


now, we can take the benz and hit the streets (i've been to the streets)
let the top down so they can see (let them see)
we can hit the clubs and party hard (oh, my god)
‘cause i just bought out the bar (ooh-ooh, no-no)
we can g5 from coast to coast (yeah)
pop champagne, let's make a toast (da, da, da, da)
now we're sippin’ café patrón (da, da, da)
smoke that kush ‘til we get blown (ooh)
