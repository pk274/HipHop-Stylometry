damn, nip
it's amazing, homie
since you've been gone, you wouldn't believe all the shit that's going on
i drove through your neighborhood the other day
and i seen some eight tray gangstas, some hoovers, some bounty hunters
i seen brothers from everywhere, man
showin' love, all in your memory
man, your legacy will live on
your legacy will live on, nephew
the marathon continues
nipsey hussle the leader, the father, the brother, the teacher, the king, the god
