easily i approach
the microphone with a pocket full of dough
the king of the coast
i'm rockin' the boat
strokin' your folks
and loc'in' with loc's
baby boy got smoked
nigga what up, nigga what up
i need cheese, paper, bread, and butter
nut up and cut up the beef
i got a '44 piece that'll shut up the {​*gun shot*}​
my niggas gonna floss to this
my crip'ed out homeboys gon' walk to this
creep to the spizzot, and stash my knizzot
then call the dizzoc, you know we got it lizzocked
pop right back on your monkey ass
then cock the glock back on your funky ass
been a long time, i shouldn't have left you
let's get loot like snoop, nephew
six deuce
