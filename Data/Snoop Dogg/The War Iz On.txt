money makes murders, sex, lies, crimes fo-fives
nines heaters, jackers, killas
cap pealers and drug dealers
snitches, snakes, bitches, fakes
bad breaks and heartaches
give and take, shake and bake
boy, i gots to stack my plate
bad news travels fast
real mashers always mask
give a dog a bone send him on he bound to come home with some cash
get you shit, stack your chips
tuck your heat, watch that bitch
she might be cute but listen here my nigga that don't mean shit
duck and dodge, camouflage
my entourage is way in charge
krayzie bone and dog capone
yeah you know the war is on
break a bitch, shoot a snitch
fuck a trick, get your grip
smoke some dank, pass some drank
and get off into this gangsta shit
we having bread, breaking bread
nigga, listen to what i said
tuck my heat, keep it close
just in case you think i'm playing
laying fools down, dog pound, bone thugs, 1 luv
and we banging from the streets to the club
