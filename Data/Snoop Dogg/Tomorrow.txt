the gift of life
god gives the gift of life
he giveth and he taketh
i was told (oh-oh, oh-oh, oh)
you only die once
so (oh-oh)
you should live every day (oh-oh)
to the fullest, right on
yeah


will i live to see another day? (oh-oh, oh-oh, oh)
stressed out, heavy on my mind, what my people gotta go through (oh-oh)
palms up, on my knees, as i pray (oh-oh)
straighten up the bow tie, i just wanna know why
i just gotta know my people get treated the same
see, we just gon' beat 'em the same (beat 'em the samе)
i'm tired of seein' the flames of hatrеd, take it and take it
i don't care if i gotta die to make this nation
see the vision of what we hold sacred
talk to him for a minute, before i meet my maker
as i step up to the mic', as-salamu alaykum


i'm just another man, fightin' through his pain
it took a lot, but what you gave, y'all just want the pain
but meanwhile, i'm just tryna make it to see tomorrow
tomorrow, tomorrow (yeah)


hell is the times, devilish eyes (oh)
lookin' at me so close, from both sides (oh, oh-oh)
the hate comin' from the back, most times (oh-oh)
i had to pray on how to compact my shine (what?)
how to move and how to act sometimes (yeah)
i went to mecca, now i'm back on mines (hmm)
eyes open, now i see it different
but in the distance, i hear the whisperin' (shh)
i don't care about my equal 
i'm just another man, fightin' through his pain
it took a lot, but what you gave, y'all just want the pain
but meanwhile, i'm just tryna make it to see tomorrow
tomorrow, tomorrow (yeah)
