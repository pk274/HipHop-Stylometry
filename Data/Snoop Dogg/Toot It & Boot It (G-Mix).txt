my nephew yg said
uncle snoop dogg
i got a pack of broads and i'm
trying to hit them all
kick 'em out and hit them all
bounce till you ball, roll with the dog
blow my house till you fall
come a who, i'm a do i'm who
girl, i'm an icon
hit you in the dark with no light on
with my ice on, put my nikes on
now iÂ´m soaring, pouring
made in america but i'm so pouring
lawin, miss me, hug me, dress me, love me, finess me
it's best we keep it on the slide on my cm
throwing up the ean
b, c she with me
i toot it and boot it
i'm suited then sootit
properly executed in front of
beauty, like kobe you know me
i'm gooter than luda always gonna shot (ya dig!)
