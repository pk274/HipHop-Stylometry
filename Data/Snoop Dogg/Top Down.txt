top down, music loud
leaves fall, don't quit
coasting through my city
doggy do what diddy
what you hearing, what you heard
turning this your learning curve
you could hooka, i'ma burn
leaves with the chronic herb
laid back, listen to it
show me how you wanna do it
if i like it, i'ma do it
if i don't, then i won't
flick some ashes on the floor
impala, '64
white on white, paint dripping
from the hood to the door
got a car full of gas but no place to go


sunset boulevard
give it to you real hard
dolo on the solo
riding around with no bodygaurd
cadillac music
lil' homie, we doos it
yes sir, i'm dressed up
and i'm the freshest
ain't no dust, we too clean to keep up
no cliques or broomsticks
homie, we sweep up
up close and personal
so ya'll can't peep us
adidas sneakers
real heat seakers
ear to the speaker
let the rhythm get you
stroll on or roll on or i'ma hit you
the sun going down but we still coming up
make a run with us
have some fun with us
drop dead, top back, blowing in the wind
rolling through the city with my newfound friend
