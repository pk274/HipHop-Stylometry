the rabbit kicked the bucket, dog said fuck it
get my 2 step on, with my turtleneck on
thin ass chain, light beer in my glass
mackin' at the bitches, the ones with the ass
girl, you know it's true, tell me what it do
oh, you like my style? say you like my crew
say you wanna be under my chest
this turtleneck is like one of my best
say you wanna be under my chest
this turtleneck is like one of my best
so i guess your dress, no stress
staying fresh is my vendetta
i'm a crook, so my look, i'm a game go getta
the fatter, the puffier, the fluffier, the bigger the turtleneck
the more gangster it is
