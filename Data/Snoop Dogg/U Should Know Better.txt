i've gone around the world and the seven seas
i'm cashing six-figure checks in all currencies
it's like when i be tearing it up in paris
motherfuckers parler on the m-i-c
it's all ooh-la-la and ahh-oui-oui
sipping vin blanc in our lingerie
chopping heads off with madame guillotine
even the french know better than to fuck with me

i'm overseas, getting cheese with this dialogue
i missed my plane to spain, so i'm stuck in cologna
i'm sipping saronno with this chick named ramona
she wants me to take a flick on her phone-ah
(she) then take her to my hotel room and then bone her


you know when in rome, i sat down with the romans
said, "we need a black pope and she better be a woman"

black president livin' in the white house

the prince of darkness know better than to fuck with me
