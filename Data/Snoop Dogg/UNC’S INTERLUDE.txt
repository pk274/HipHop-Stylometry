i'ma hollar at y'all in a minute
i'm finna call my lil' niece real quick, man
('til i get back, forget it)
yo, it's chika, um, i won't be available for a little while
but if you wanna leave a message, you know what to do, after the tone
chika-leeka, put your ears to the speaker
it's the one and only, snoop d-o double-g

lettin' you know i'm watchin' every move you make
you shakin' and bakin', you doin' ya thang
keep your eyes open and don't let this sucker shit drive you blind
keep your foot on the gas, eyes on the priz–µ
i love you baby girl, peace
