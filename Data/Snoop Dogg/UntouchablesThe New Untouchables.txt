hmm
when you're in the fast lane havin' money and fame
you got to, always, check, the game
look here mane, maintain
'cause this game is a cold thing
can you dig it mane?
fo sho' mane, i wish i had your game
look here young dog, do your own thing
them bitch ass niggas in your clique, buck 'em no
stay real with yourself and untouchable
see that's what's wrong with you niggas now
but uh, me and my dawgs from the thug pound
we just paper chasin', we know nay-thing
are you relatin' to the shit we creatin'?
