if you ain't up on things
fabolous is the name, street fam is the game
screamin' 718 while them hammers bang
like bludda ludda lacca bludda ludda lacca
kick game like i know a little bit of soccer
spic, dames, ass and a little bit of knockers
give them nick names and a little bit of vodka
then i'm game change.. (she's a very freaky girl)
you know who got the gold like the kid from "the last dragon"
you know who got the low on the spokes and the ass saggin'
you know who got the gold that'll have your ass gaggin'
you know who got the boat that'll have the task naggin'
but i fuck bitches, and get money
my truck switches like.. errrrr
you got to duck bitches when you get twenties
and plug switches that make you sit funny
i'm a rider..


if you ain't up on things
don't come close to me
unless you ride like you supposed to be
if you ain't up on things
don't come close to me
unless you pimpin' like you supposed to be
if you ain't up on things
don't come close to me
unless you banging like you supposed to be
if you ain't up on things
don't come close to me
unless you gangster like you supposed to be


if you ain't up on things
don't come close to me
unless you ride like you supposed to be
if you ain't up on things
don't come close to me
unless you pimpin' like you supposed to be


so my niggas (niggas)

throw your motherfucking hand in the air (in the air)
and if you up on things and you don't give a fuck

and all my bitches (bitches)
they get money (money)

and if you up on things and you don't give a fuck
let me hear y'all bitches scream oh yeah (oh yeah)
