follow directions please
let's go!


ugh... the boss in the buildin'
try to turn it on, you get offed in this buildin'
higher than a muh, gettin' lost in the feelin'
motherfuck the law, i got a ball for the children
nigga - drunk than a bitch though
'fore i hit the spot i had a bottle full of cisco
ate the kush and a model in a trenchcoat
a crip with a lot of cash, check on how the wrist roll
baby saw it in my eyes and she knew that i was lookin' at her
ain't a chance to get her, i can m-i-crooked letter
if she with a nigga i'mma steal her, yeah a crook'll have her
throwin' up the e once the d get to cookin' in her (eastside!)
yeah, so what's it gon' be?
golden black joe clark, h.n.i.c
regulatin' on any hatin' i see
something good in your hands then repeat after me


bang to the boogie, keep a thang in my dungarees
bailin' through the eastside, feelin' like a younger g
eatin' like a muh, but i'm so, so hun-g-ry
i dare one of these young dumb fucks to try and fuck with me
fucker, i'm back to the party
marley, bacardi, shawty, gnarly
becky, and vicky beggin' me to give me hickeys
through my dickies


lil' mama tryin' to show the dogg her g-string
while she sang ain't "nuthin' but a 'g' thang"
a nigga throwin' signs tryin' to let me know that he bang
like i give a motherfuck what he claim
ay, your nigga better chill doggy
'fore i treat him like a old bitch and menopause him
i'll stop your ass right there
i swear had homies on your head like hair
homie i ain't thinkin', i'm too busy drinkin'
plumber of the month, mami show me where your sink is
so i can get to uncloggin'
i hope that lil' cat ready for this bigg dogg and woof!
