ha, what ya got? (x4)


a million things run through my mind
and you ain't gotta be in jail to be doin' time


time brings change and change brings time
just sit back and listen let me hit you wit a line
that i wrote and i quote that it's dope from the top
please don't you quit, oh snoop can't stop
i rock non stop when i have that mic
i give you motherfuckers just what ya like
you can bounce, you can pop, but just don't stop
cause when i take the mic i plan to make your body rock
and don't you quit and don't you spit nothing to me
cause you can't do me, why you talkin' madness you handed
your microphone to your mouth now
you couldn't spit nothin' couldn't even turn it out, dumb ass
you got jealous and the fellas got mad at you
you couldn't do what the l.b.c. crew do
you couldn't do what the d.p.g. niggas do
and you damn sure can't do what the l.a. zoo do
try to stay true and try to get wit this
niggas since dogg was on the mic i'm too sick wit this
and when i come with some, boy i'm so ridiculous
now shut the fuck up and listen while i'm kickin' this


a million things run through my mind
and you ain't gotta be in jail to be doin' time




what you watchin' the clock for?
time keeps on slippin', slippin', slippin', slippin', slippin'...
me and my niggas just keep on dippin'...
but i ain't set trippin'
yeah... throwin' down y'all
they fucked around and let some dogs in the zoo
i've never seen a dog at a zoo
true...
oh yeah, west coast
(we are party people, dogg pound gangstas are party people)
