man, don't you know that i'm loco?
mhm, hm


i was chillin' (chillin') right around my way (way)
21st, east side of the beach
this motherfucker ran up on me
talkin' shit with his homies like he was a straight g
askin' where i'm from while he runnin' up
gangbang my set on e'ry one of 'em (20's, nigga, 20's)
some things, sons, they just won't change
fools don't respect nuttin' but the gangbang (bang)
what's seen is what's saw, dogg is the law
i have you niggas runnin' like a marathon
lil' g's tryna creep on the east with it
talkin' 'bout they gon' get my chain and they gon' leave with it (mm)
but they don't know once they get close
it's tic-tac-toe, three motherfuckers laid on the floor (watch out)
yeah, this happened yesterday
on the west they spray, i heard a ese say, he said


vato, you won't believe what i saw
i saw this pack of guys and they act real hard (and what they do?)
they twist their fingers, say, "you know who we are"
he said, "i don't give a fuck, i'm snoop doggy dogg" (uh-huh)
they keep talkin' and it went too far
so snoopy, he went straight to the trunk of his car (and what he get?)
he got his gun and they start runnin' hard
he started firing and then he just charged


(blaow) run nigga, run nigga
(blaow) duck nigga, duck nigga
(blaow) run, motherfucker, run
(blaow) run, motherfucker, run
(blaow) run nigga, run nigga
(blaow) duck nigga, duck nigga
(blaow) run, motherfucker, run
(blaow) run, motherfucker, run


i didn't mean to hit what i hit
now there's three motherfuckers dead and i ain't seen shit
but these niggas'll scream for plea
but for a g like me, it's just a case, really, you could see
i crack the mac back and pop off rollin'
and smack ya neck back, ya drop off, fallin'
i haven't seen my mama in a week
and she ain't even ran her mouth about me
fuck that, i ain't give a fuck about the law
niggas say they wanna brawl, you would think that they were broads
believin' all the things that you never saw
in it, y'all, been a dogg, smoke you like a menthol
you think you know? but this can't go
you think you'll blow on my dope? what the fuck? no
see these niggas proceed with speed
so feel the need to bleed, all you hear my enemies goin'


vato, you won't believe what i saw

(blaow) run nigga, run nigga
(blaow) duck nigga, duck nigga
(blaow) run, motherfucker, run
(blaow) run, motherfucker, run
(blaow) run nigga, run nigga
(blaow) duck nigga, duck nigga
(blaow) run, motherfucker, run
(blaow) run, motherfucker, run


i wouldn't be the nigga that i am
if i didn't pop niggas in they mouth, goddamn
and snoop'll keep one foot on the streets
and leave 'em covered in sheets, run with them niggas with the heat (heat)
you never seen a thug like this
you never seen a dub like me
and i ain't weak for wanting peace
in fact, i could be "beast of the east", motherfucker
i never hesitate to blaze (blaze)
a nigga really tryna change his ways
we gotta move my team, 'cause my peoples
is screamin' that we need more for fun or it's illegal
ba-ba-bang on a song, make it feel like a drive-by (drive-by)
it's a shame, but somebody gotta die (die)
they see it happen state-to-state
but when i'm mobbin' l.a., all i hear the eses say, they go


vato, you won't believe what i saw
i saw this pack of guys and they act real hard (and what they do?)

(blaow) run nigga, run nigga
(blaow) duck nigga, duck nigga
(blaow) run, motherfucker, run
