take a deep breath, now what you tryna do?
doggy dogg with the shit, but i'm not a fool
when i step up in the party, hoes know the rule
and if the bitch can't swim, sit by the pool
light up a backwood, i'm back, hood
what's cracking? i keep a bad bitch with me, that's how i do it
caked up like it's my birthday, nigga, feeling good
then blow out the candles and wish a nigga would
fuck around with the reason your ho stuck around
niggas wanna act funny, i got a bunch of clowns
i make money to play with, to stay rich
hoes wanna label the nigga, but say, hey bitch
