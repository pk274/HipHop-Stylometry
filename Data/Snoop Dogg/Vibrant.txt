foot to the pedal, quick with the metal
i'mma skate to bake until the whole cake settle
mellow, mellow, welcome to the ghetto
stokley provoked me to do it a cappella so
i'mma flip it with the dip on the 4
right leg, left foot put the hip in the flow
skip in the toe, i spit magnificent flow
none of that, 100 racks, run it back
yeah 1-2-1-2, on the dance floor baby make it do what it do
i got gin, hen and a bunch of my friends
and we can get it like that because that's what time it is
i know you've heard of my reputation
big snoop dogg, i am a soul sensation
put the dip in your hip, put the glide in your slide
now we can bounce, rock, right, right
