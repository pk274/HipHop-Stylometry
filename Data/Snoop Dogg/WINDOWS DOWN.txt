mm, roll the windows down
got a pound of weed with a bad bitch staying ten toes down
i'm in traffic with a classic, blowing indo loud
and this bitch looking at me like, "nigga, you sure got style"
i greet with a, slow speed with a
marijuana leaf inside a 'wood with no seeds, nigga
i got the realest, no pretender
hit it once and all that bullshit you won't remember
you're looking for a brighter day
pass and take a puff, that thang'll hit your ass right away
nigga don't know what to say
ask him if he cool, that nigga answer back, "satatay"
meditate while i'm medicating at the house
feeling like i'm levitating to the clouds
never hate, congratulate you with a smile
we ain't smoked in a while, roll them windows down
