say, baby, wait a minute
hey, hey, don't go nowhere, baby, come here
(you could spend the night, girl)
(oh, girl)
i'm 'bout to say, baby, you can't just go away like that, wait a minute
let me talk to you, sexy mama, yeah
we could spend some time together, just me and you (oh, girl wait)
i figured we could have a chocolate malt (oh, girl wait)
with a cheeseburger and some fries
sit in my low-rider (oh, girl wait)
watching some motion picture
but, wait a minute, baby, wait, wait
(girl, wait)
