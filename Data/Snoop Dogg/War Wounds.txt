i got a muthafuckin' story to tell
nigga, nigga what?
a muthafuckin' story to tell (what?)
fool, i got a muthafuckin' story tah tell
and every nigga in the jail cell knows it well
i shank niggas, bank niggas
do mo' fo' show
seven cluckas, fake dough
stayin' way cut throat
i hang out, slang out, at hotel rooms
up all night gettin' in gun fights
i strike my head on the wall
sippin 8 ball
eastside, rollin' dubs
call me big snoop dogg
follow me, and you'll see how gs move
it's written on my face
i takes my war wounds
been around drama since me and my mama
use to listen to oldies
that's why i'm so og
look, when half of you niggas couldn't come outside
when ya'll was learnin how tah sing
i was learnin' how tah bang and ride
fo' sho' bro, i told yah
im'a gangsta soulja, blowin' doja
what a story tah tell..
