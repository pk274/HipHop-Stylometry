want them girl a sexy, i want to be close to you immensely
come in my bedroom, undress me, now rub me down girl, caress me
radio play in paris, overlookin' the terrace
baby blushin', she so embarrased
got her a ring full of karats
baguettes, pearls, and diamonds too
treat ya right, that's what a wise man do
a bird's eye view, wit' a art from the louvre
kissin' on my body, sparks at the moon
barks at the moon, like a thief in the night
step to my left, so we keepin' it right
keepin' it tight, livin' the life
lovin' the night, huggin' ya tight
ya need a crip cuz in ya life
and that's me, ooh-wee, og snoopy
let's take a walk in the sand, baby, gimme yo' hand
