we all need somebody that we can lean on
when you wake up look around and see that your dream's gone
when the earthquakes we'll help you make it through the storm
when the floor breaks a magic carpet to stand on
we are the world united by love so strong
when the radio isn't on you can hear the songs
a guided light on the dark road you're walking on
a signpost to find the dreams you thought was gone
someone to help you move the obstacles you stumbled on
someone to help you rebuild after the rubble's gone
we are the world connected by a common bond
love the whole planet's singing along
