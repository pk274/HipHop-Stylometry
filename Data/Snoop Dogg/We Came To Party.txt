oh, no… big snoop dogg
ice so cold you can see it through the fog
to walk in my shoes it’ll be a little jog
and if you step by the pockets, you gon’ be up in the morgue
the peoples is peepin’, peepin’
the bitches is dippin’, dippin’
so this is the mission, listen, i turn this shit up
it’s the party-rocking, nonstopping, four-hopping, rip and rock
drippin’ in this motherfucker, burn up, now turn up!
