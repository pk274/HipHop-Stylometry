love me, love me, love me, love me, love me, uh-huh, oh-oh
love me, love me, love me, love me, love me, ayy (yeah)


they don't know what we saw (you saw), the pain we come from (oh)
but we ain't gotta worry no more (woah)
they don't know what we saw (we saw), the pain we come from (from)
but we ain't gotta worry no more


from residing in long beach to
havin' the president at our arms reach to
my compound being so damn profound
they told me all of this shit was beyond me (ooh-wee)
i seen homicides by way of drive-bys
hoppin' on jets, funny how time flies
i got big shoes to fill, they laurents, i
shed a tear as i stare in my mom's eyes
yeah, i prophesied it and i manifested
yeah, my pockets were skinny, yeah, they was anorexic
yeah, i beat a murder case and made your favorite records (records)
yeah, let me say this message


they don't know what we saw (you saw), the pain we come from (oh)
but we ain't gotta worry no more (woah)
they don't know what we saw (we saw), the pain we come from (from)
but we ain't gotta worry no more


uh, neighborhoods, the gentrified
our efforts, they wanna minimize
but a nigga serve a living god
but sometimes, we still ask, "why?"
'cause they don't know my pain and struggle
all the shit i seen
'cause they just see the flashin' lights, the car
the shit was a dream
cousins is doin' life sentence
all of my bitches light-skinned
history in the making and we right in it
grand slam on yo' ass in the 9th inning


they don't know what we saw (you saw), the pain we come from (oh)
but we ain't gotta worry no more (woah)
they don't know what we saw (we saw), the pain we come from (from)
but we ain't gotta worry no more


love me, love me, love me, love me, love me, uh-huh, oh-oh
love me, love me, love me, love me, love me, ayy (yeah)
i just wanna see how beautiful you are
you know that i see it, i know you're a star
