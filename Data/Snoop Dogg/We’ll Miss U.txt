there's no way i can express the way that i feel
all i know is that it's hard and it's for real
all i wanna say is "i love you, uncle june"
just to let you know forever we miss you
gone but not forgotten (we miss you)
gone but not forgotten (we miss you)

hmm, my eldest uncle og like tookie
wake up in the morning like "hi my little pokie!"
nah nah-nah nah my lil tutu
make yo people smile and laugh is what you used to
dancin' across the stage with daz and kurupt, joe cool
supafly, and the homegirl rage now turn the page
you gone and now i'm missin' you
banging on persons a lot lo' in the dressing rooms
boomed and groomed dipped in whip
one thing about my uncle june bugg, he talk plenty shit
hennessey oh e a pack of winchester
every line, every sentence you really made a difference
mississippi to l.a. working the soft gate
family landscape remember miss johnson
that mom with sugar free i miss you like a muthafucka
june bugg rest in peace


there's no way i can express the way that i feel
all i know is that it's hard and it's for real
all i wanna say is "i love you, uncle june"
just to let you know forever we miss you
