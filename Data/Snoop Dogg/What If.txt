yeah, man
do you ever sit and wonder sometimes
what if?
i mean, like, for real though
i mean, sometimes i just sit and think to myself, like
what if?
i mean, that's a big question, right?
if "if" was a fifth, we'd all be fucked up
but what i really wanna know is:
what if?


(what if?)
the bloods and the crips was the same
and all niggas joined one gang
(what if?)
my granny wouldn't have died
man, i probably wouldn't have been from the east side
(what if?)
you could do what you don't
and live how you motherfuckin' want, say that
(what if?)
a phony is a phony, a homie is a homie
and you know the big homie don't play that


catch him, stick him
rip it, ride it
la di da di, we shout out the party
the old me, the new you, you niggas tryna do me
you better off tryna do you
boo hoo, voodoo, taboo
dp, gc, what it really do?
i educate when i illustrate
and those the words i be teachin', preachin'
to each and everyone
never been a scary one
always been a down ass nigga, clown ass nigga
reppin' my city, 
(what if?)
the bloods and the crips was the same
and all niggas joined one gang
(what if?)
my granny wouldn't have died
man, i probably wouldn't have been from the east side
(what if?)
you could do what you don't
and live how you motherfuckin' want, say that
(what if?)
we had a reckless motherfucker
that was king of west coast instead of big snoop dogg
(what if?)
we never had a nigga like big p
from the southside, nigga goin' "woof"
(what if?)
we never had a real woman
that could raise us and teach us, show us what the real was
(what if?)
we had to take it
if you didn't have suga free, motherfucker, you had to make it
(what if?)
