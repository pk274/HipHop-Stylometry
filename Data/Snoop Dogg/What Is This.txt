funky, nottz
what it do, oh (funky, funky funky)
you got one (yes-sir, lbc)
matter of fact, we got two (two, two, two)


fuck that bitch, i'm black
and i’m back like o.j., player's club
rappin 4 tay, internet going cray
everyday, r&b niggas on memes 'cause they half-way gay
hold on, slow down, dogg, you a fool with it
i don’t know if these cats, is goin' to be cool with it (fuck 'em)
if you get to call a babysitter (what?)
hiti-fita, let the sugar honey ice tea, it gets bitter
with your taste buds tellin' when you hit that
you ain't know i did that?
i'm smooth with the get back
sit back, now let me serenade you
not to invade you, but tell me what he paid you
i know what did, not pimpin' perhaps
premeditated, with his whack-ass raps
i snaps into a different mode
damn right, a different cold
it's the matrix, now download
tag game (tag game), upgrade
big snoop dogg is a mustang
and a must-see, you can trust me
and ain't a motherfuckin' pig that can bust me
stole me up (what?)
punk politicians tryna call me up
'cause my cap like benetton's
and my ac with no fan
i'm big (waddup), all the way


you know what's funky, funky, funky
'cause you heard it from snoop dogg
the champ, you can play when you bouncin' your beat ball
left a few bricks, now i'm makin' the g-code
my prices went up, ain't no need for no free fall
