have you ever heard of a slaughter?
i oughta start dippin', sippin' on that s-t gets me to trippin'
i don't slips, i bangs with that mad-ass
dogg pound gang, it's a dpg thang
kurupt from the sc
you wanna test me? let's see if you'll survive forty-five times
like a hollow point headed for your dome
take a couple of steps, turn around and it's on
couldn't withstand the murderous mental
i subdue and then take two to ya temple
when i cause holocaust from what's written
niggas collapsin' when the straps is spittin'
look, this is how it's done, nigga (one, two, three)
i grab my strap, you best run, nigga
i gives a fuck, kurupt's the kingpin of the clique
littlest g with the biggest dick


now, what would you? (what would you do?)
if you could fuck with me or my crew?
but you can't, so don't even think about
steppin' in the motherfuckin' house
what would you? (what would you do?)
if you could fuck with me or my crew?
but you can't, so don't even think about
steppin' in the motherfuckin' house (hey)


bitches butterfly all day while i steady make my pay
every single day in the lbc (hey, hey)
cruisin' through the east side, me and lil' style
in the back of a green '64 bustin' freestyles


now, if a nigga had a prayer before a nigga died
would the nigga be dead, or would he stay alive?
and if i was in your shoes, would i survive?
probably not, you'd probably let your glock go pop
now drop to your knees
and picture dat nigga daz (flowin') flowin' in the breeze (breeze)


now, what would you do? (what would you do?)
if you could fuck with me or my crew? (ha-ha)
but you can't, so don't even think about
steppin' in the motherfuckin' house
what would you do? (what would you do?)
if you could fuck with me or my crew? (ha-ha)
but you can't, so don't even think about
steppin' in my motherfuckin' house, biatch
