as easy as it looks to you, i make it look so easy
with the music i be making, the impression i be leaving
a lot of folks they stop and stare, thinking i'ma trick it off
i roll another bleezy, puff it, pass it and shake it off
move on to the next phase and it's amazing
the next generation of rappers, big snoop dogg raising 'em
that's fifteen years in the game
still got the fortune and fame, yeah i'm doing my thang
check this devin, somebody said that real gs to go heaven
so i'mma keep spitting the truth on these fools like a reverend
stay open like 7-11, that's 24/7
when you need some hot shit, stop by and get you a beverage
i'm serving, my rhymes like nickels and dimes
plug it in, let it play and let me blow your mind
it's the dominant, conglomerate, prominent, and i'mma get
what i gotta get, twist another sweet and bob to the beat


yeah, this life we live, what a job this isâ€”real spit, man
a lot of folks wanna walk in these shoes
but they just don't know, man, it's a hell of a job, man
to be a rapper, mc, whatever you want to call it, man
we got a lot to deal with
family members we gotta always look out for
baby momma nagging, you namsayin', kids need this
and then again the public need that, we gotta make hot music
'cause if it ain't hot, it don't mean shit
but you know, it's all in a day's work
what a job this is my nigga
what's crack-a-lacking, devin the dizzude?
snoop d-o dub, j prince, jas prince
yeah, rap-a-lot still on top, 2007
what a job this is
