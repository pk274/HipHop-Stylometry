one thing you can count on when you touch down
you gon' have it all, laid out, everything is paid out
comin' home eventually, in the penitentiary
the homies like to mention me, cause i looks out essentially
big reese cup, j dog and trey-d
young joe dog, scotty boy, nyc
(?)
blue put me on the set, nigga, it's twenty crips
my cousin' flip been locked up for twenty five
and trey-lo? he's a real twenty-crip for life
and if i mention your name, you know the business cuz
when you get out, you know we livin' it up
