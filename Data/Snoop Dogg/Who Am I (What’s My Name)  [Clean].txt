it's the bow to the wow, creepin' and crawlin'
yiggy, yes y'all'in, snoop doggy dogg in
the house, with the pound, like everyday
and i'm right back up in ya with dr. dre
and like i said
none of y'all can't get with this
and none of y'all can't get with that
hit i just drop, cause you know it don't stop
mr. 187 on a undercover cop
tick, tock
never the glock
just some nuts and a cock
rob you for your ears, then i kill you blood clots
and i step through the fog, and i creep through the smog
cause i'm snoop doggy (who?)
doggy (what?)
doggy {dogg}
