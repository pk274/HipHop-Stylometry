we're comin' with that g shit, that c shit that makin' niggas sick
how does it feel to see a g from your clique?
wake up, jumped out of bed with my grin on (why?)
last night's dice game, got my win on
about a g and a half is what i came with
but twenty-five g's is what i left with
tee-lee was the word i heard
i went deep in my pockets and threw my stars on the curb
gimme the dice so i can break you niggas
i threw a six (c-i-x) so my point was the biggest
seven, four, four, tre back to back
i sent two fools back to they 'leezzac


g and snoop, homies from the motherfuckin' get-go
devoted and quotin', back in '84
i was thirteen, g was a year older
but i still wasn't afraid to throw 'em from the shoulders
gettin' put on the hood was the anticipation
and yeah, king park was the destination
every nigga that i knew was at the park that night
even the smokers that be lovin' to get sparked at night


back on the streets, straight blue and gray
'cause i represent like every day
nigga, you can't tell me i don't be on the spot
when i can tell you all the homies that done got shot
from at least about five years ago
when i was in junior high goin' to marshall
the homie use to come up to the school and rock
and leave and have the bitches flockin' his jock
damn, them was the days of the past
but since the pizzound formed, we been whippin' people's ass
and everybody'll blast
and if you don't believe me, nigga, you can ask the homie daz
and that's your ass
fucked around and let young swoop take your cash (haha)
he didn't even run, he walked away (busta)
cuz, i lived to see that day
i wished i was there, i woulda clowned
but that's why we "x"-ed your bitch ass from the pound
'cause he wouldn't even squab back
man, we can't fuck with no niggas like that
he'll get us all cracked
if the police was behind us, he wouldn't even jump out with the strap
now that's what i call a beeyatch! (beeiyitch!)
i second the motion, you was dropped from the clique (yeah, yeah)


some of these nigga are bitches, too
and some of these niggas look just like you
so if you've ever been told on
go out and get your roll on
you punk ass nigga, you gettin' stole on


now i knew that them niggas couldn't get at you
so what made them niggas try to spit at you?
disrespect the game then snitch on you
y'all punk ass niggas, man, y'all some bitches, too


who got some gangsta gangsta shit? (haha)
swoop g, i heard somebody's speakin' up on me
'cause when i drop mines there was no more nickels and dimes
just boulders, ounces, half ounces and quarter pieces
see, it's the season and i don't smoke bunk
it's either indo or skunk, i might as well get drunk
than smoke some stress, that shit'll put a hole in your chest
i only want another twenty dollar, sure got me fucked up
my hood is gettin' hot and niggas is tryna plot and
come up off a young nigga callin' his shots
swoop g ain't the one, i do what's to be done (ah)
always have my gun and my g from 2-1 (ah, ah)
in cerritos, but you don't hear me though
'cause you don't really know about the you-know
on cerritos, silly ho
swoop g, motherfuckin' lbc
none of these nigga wanna fuck with me (ah)
swoop g (ah, ah, ah)
g, g
