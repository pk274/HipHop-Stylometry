make your moves, get your dibs, nigga, fuck them kids
talkin' shit about you, dawg, they don't know how it is
that's on the up, y'all! you know what? motherfuck y'all!
'cause i'm the top dog, big dog, big ball on the block
gettin' money, fuckin' hoes, and rockin' hip-hop
methods of mayhem with d-o-double-g-y
and we ride, slidin' to a whole different deal on the street
bang-bang, chitty, chitty
i'm a crazy nigga from the mad ass long beach city!
i'm not your neighbor, i'm a gangsta
with the flaver and ill behavior!
