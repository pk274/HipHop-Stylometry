i miss your breakfast in the mornin'
miss you in the evenin', tell me why you're leavin'
please give me a reason, nothin' could ever change me
i'm missin' my baby, think i'm goin' crazy

(why did you leave me?)
you can't leave me by myself like this
you can't leave me by myself like this
(why did you leave me?)
you can't leave me by myself like this
mama told me there'll be days like this
