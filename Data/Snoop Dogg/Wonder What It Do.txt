independent, i'm in it, been getting my cash right
walking through the daytime holding my flashlight
spliff-ted, high as i could ever be
i'm lifted, drifting on the memory
my style, my tone, my delivery
my maze is frankie beverly
heavily influenced, i do it like you can't
i'm the weed to the zag with the bag of the drink
get live, that's five on the black hand side
now try to stay fly with a piece of the pie
i heard fish don't burn in the kitchen
the baby gangsters, they get in the hood and on a mission
uh, you pump 'em, up they fuck it up
now what you need to do is toughen up
now chuck it up, what it do, dog?
i thought you wanted to be like big (snoop dogg)


when i get lost (when i get lost)
i feel like a boss (feel like a boss)
she will be my salvation (marijuana-uana-uana)
and when i feel low (i feel low)
with nowhere to go (nowhere to go)
she'll be my inspiration (marijuana-uana-uana-uana)
she never spends (she never spends)
time with her friends (nuh-uh, nuh-uh)
tells me she's blue without me
and when things go wrong (yeah)
her faith is strong
i know that she'll never doubt me
(hey, snoop dogg)


ooh-hoo (what it do? what it do?)
i wonder, wonder, wonder what it do (yeah, wonder, wonder, wonder what it do, i wonder what it do)
ooh-hoo (yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, i wonder what it do)
i wonder, wonder, wonder what it do (get your groove on, uh, yeah)


la-la-la-la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la-la (do it make you feel good?)
la-la-la-la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la-la (do it make you feel good?)
la-la-la-la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la-la (do it make you feel good?)
la-la-la-la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la-la (do it make you feel good?)
