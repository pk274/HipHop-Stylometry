there are times when i don't wanna speak
grab a pen, scratch your chin, make the beat
maybe not, smokin' pot on the beach
paranoid with my boys, where my keys?
and my head in the clouds, is that him?
and my boys trippin' hard like nigga, chill
someone new with the mouthful of boot
now my boys, they come in with the deal


i'm not mad at you
things i'm going through make me act the fool
please don't think i'm cruel
really normally i'm cool
there is nothing you can do
hey
when my words are few
things ain't what they seem
feeling like i'm fooling me
i know god is calling me
i'm not where i'm supposed to be
sitting here smoking trees
when i should be on my knees
when my words are few


why you hounding me in the house of the lord?
watch us, guilty
ain't no move in the parking lot prophecies
that's why at the benediction, you can't find me
oh ain't no smiles, ain't no joke
no bitches, please
ain't no rest for my soul til' i come clean
i'll hear from the lord if i speak
so back off and let me eat, let me feast


i'm not mad at you
things i'm going through make me act the fool
please don't think i'm cruel
really normally i'm cool
there is nothing you can do
hey
when my words are few
things ain't what they seem
feeling like i'm fooling me
i know god is calling me
i'm not where i'm supposed to be
sitting here smoking trees
when i should be on my knees
when my words are few
