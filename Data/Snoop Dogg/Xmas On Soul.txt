shante want a new house and slink want a car
lil' snoop want a g and jack wanna be a star
can i grant these wishes? i guess i can
'cause once again, merry christmas
and it's nothing like getting your folks what they been wanting for months
see, most of us been blessed stay blessed 'cause we keep on blessin’
be jolly and keep on pressin’, somebody gonna learn a lesson
about love, mo’ hugs, no shrug, show love
face to face as we sit by the fireplace, the food is great, have a taste
now turn up the bass and let me throw a pass to my homeroom class
first and foremost we walk in slow-mo, santa got me a brand new low low
feeling the breeze blowing the christmas tree


merry christmas y'all from big snoop dogg, terrace martin, j-black
and dj quick on the boards
