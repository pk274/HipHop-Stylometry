how do you do and how do you feel
you got to walk the walk up the hill
i'm so for real
you know the deal
real will appeal
time will reveal
heartbreaks, new love, both times
is what you was
good times is what i like
and that's why i love my life
see everyday i wake up and i'm feeling brand new
cuz i'm living my life without you
so you can stop the day
i got my heart safely locked away
