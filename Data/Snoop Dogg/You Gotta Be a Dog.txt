big dog nigga, and i do this for life
with my hands in the sky, omega psi phi
don't try to dare pick a bone with me
you'll get popped, so it's best you get along with me
and try to figure out how to get this paper bag servin' late
see, me and my dogs, we made reservations
new whip, new ship, renovations
rebuildin' the hood, public relations
stomp down deep, when i walk loc
and everybody listen when i talk loc
never been scary, fuck the owner, beware of the dog
'cause i'm killin' if it's necessary
