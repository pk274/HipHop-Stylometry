is this thing on? word


you know what? it's like i'm seventeen again
peach fuzz on my face, lookin' on the case
tryna find a hella taste, oh, my god
i'm on the chase, chevy, it's gettin' kinda heavy, relevant, sellin' it
dippin' away, time keeps slippin' away
zip in the safe, flippin' for pay
tippin' like i'm drippin' in paint
upfront, four blunts, like, "khalifa put the weed in a j"


uh, and i don't even care
'cause if me and my team in there
there's gon' be some weed in the air
tell 'em, mac
blowin' everywhere we goin' and now you knowin'
when i step right up, get my lighter so i can light up
that's how it should be done
soon as you thinkin' you're down
find how to turn things around
now things are lookin' up
from the ground up, pound up, this taylor gang
so turn my sound up and mount up and do my thang
uh, now i'm chillin', fresh outta class, feelin'
like i'm on my own and i could probably own a building
got my own car, no job, no children
had a science project, me and mac killed it
t-h-c, m-a-c, d-e-v, h-d-3, high as me
this is us, we gon' fuss
and we gon' fight and we gon' roll
and live off life
