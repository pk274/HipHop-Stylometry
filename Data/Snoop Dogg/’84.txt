yeah. hey, yo, nephew
let me holla at baby real quick, man
check it out baby
skate slow, ’84, wait for me
groove so smooth you’ve been hating on me
but i don’t really trip because i’m d.o. double g
the one who put the jimmy choo heels on your feet
slide up the street while i ride to the beat
you cute and petite, but down low you a freak
and i’mma blow you down, slow you down, i’ll show you how
so turn around so i can turn you on the doggy style
this just the fixture, silver satin, you get the picture
dying to get with you, foot to the floor
me and my nephew ro, ro
