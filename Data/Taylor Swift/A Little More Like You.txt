think of something you can't touch
i see angels start to blush when they look at you
when i went to my guitar to write this song i fell apart
'cause i'm counting every second like time in a jar
and these words are just words, that's not what you are


would you rather me say what i really mean?
i love you but it won't get through if i try too hard
honestly, what i really mean
is i want to be a little more like you


drag a pen across a page
take a look at what you made- you made me, me
turn around and watch me live
learn again that to forgive is to believe
and to thank is to bless
i'm drawing the curtain, 'cause now i've been blessed


would you rather me say what i really mean?
i love you but it won't get through if i try too hard
honestly, what i really mean
is i want to be a little more like you
yeah, i want to be a little more like you


there seems to be something i can't see
that keeps you from falling apart
it's safe to say you're far away
and anybody else, oh anybody else


would you rather me say what i really mean?
i love you but it won't get through if i try too hard
honestly, what i really mean
is i want to be a little more like you
yeah, i want to be a little more like you, like you
yeah, i want to be a little more like you
