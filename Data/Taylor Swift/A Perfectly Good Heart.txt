why would you wanna break
a perfectly good heart?
why would you wanna take
our love and tear it all apart now?
why would you wanna make
the very first scar?
why would you wanna break
a perfectly good heart?


maybe i should've seen the signs
should've read the writing on the wall
and realized by the distance in your eyes
that i would be the one to fall


no matter what you say
i still can't believe that you would walk away
it don't make sense to me, but


why would you wanna break
a perfectly good heart?
why would you wanna take
our love and tear it all apart now?
why would you wanna make
the very first scar?
why would you wanna break
a perfectly good heart?


it's not unbroken anymore (it's not unbroken anymore)
how do i get it back the way it was before?


why would you wanna break
a perfectly good heart?
why would you wanna take
our love and tear it all apart now?
why would you wanna make
the very first scar?
why would you wanna breakâ€”
(why) would you wanna break it?


why would you wanna break
a perfectly good heart?
why would you wanna take
our love and tear it all apart now?
why would you wanna make
the very first scar?
why would you wanna break
a perfectly good heart?


mmm-hmm
