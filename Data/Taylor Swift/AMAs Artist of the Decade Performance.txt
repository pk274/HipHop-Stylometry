i stay out too late
got nothing in my brain
that's what people say, mm, mm
that's what people say, mm, mm
i go on too many dates
but i can't make them stay
at least that's what people say, mm, mm
that's what people say, mm, mm


'cause the players gonna play, play, play, play, play
and the haters gonna hate, hate, hate, hate, hate
baby, i'm just gonna shake, shake, shake, shake, shake
i shake it off, i shake it off
heartbreakers gonna break, break, break, break, break
and the fakers gonna fake, fake, fake, fake, fake
baby, i'm just gonna shake, shake, shake, shake, shake
i shake it off, i shake it off


'cause the players gonna play, play, play, play, play
and the haters gonna hate, hate, hate, hate, hate (haters gonna hate)
baby, i'm just gonna shake, shake, shake, shake, shake
i shake it off, i shake it off
heartbreakers gonna break, break, break, break, break
and the fakers gonna fake, fake, fake, fake, fake
baby, i'm just gonna shake, shake, shake, shake, shake
i shake it off, i shake it off


i shake it off, i shake it off
i, i, i shake it off, i shake it off
i, i, i shake it off, i shake it off
i, i, i shake it off, i shake it off
