i wake up
i stretch out
i wonder what you're doin' right now
yeah i slept, in my makeup again
tell myself 'i must be crazy'
thinkin' 'bout him
i find myself something decent to wear
take the towel out of my hair
about that time, you call me
and i'm reminded, without you


i'd be a stranger in an all night diner
waiting for a love to find her
lonely like a harbor light
that's never seen a boat
like a line in an old love letter
no one ever wrote


i go to work
work all day
i'm a walking tape recorder
of everything you say
walk to the car, dig out my keys
start thinkin' if you were with anyone but me


i'm a stranger in an all night diner
waiting for a love to find her
lonely like a harbor light
that's never seen a boat
like a line in an old love letter
no one ever wrote


there you are
on the street
just standing there, waiting on me
i show you, my new shoes
you say you love them
'nd baby without you -


i'm a stranger in an all night diner
waiting for a love to find her
lonely like a harbor light
that's never seen a boat
like a line in an old love letter
no one ever wrote


i wake up
i stretch out
i wonder what you're doin' right now
