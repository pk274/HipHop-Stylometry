sometimes i wonder how it's going to feel
will my first love be true and real?
will i be ready when my heart starts to fall?
what will i do when my love comes to call?
and my daddy tells me that i light up his world
everyday he says, darling you're my best girl
he tried to teach me from the very start
the meaning of love so nobody breaks my heart


will my love come in a bowl of fire?
will it be filled with hope and desire?
will my love come in a pouring rain?
am i ready for the joy, am i ready for the pain
am i ready for the boy, am i ready for love


i know i'm not a little girl anymore
cause i'm feeling things i've never felt before
sweet sensations and anticipations
calling commotion to my emotions
and i hear the words my daddy said to me
he said be true 2 yourself & keep your spirit free
and love will find you one way or another
be good to yourself and be good to each other




it's a run around the world
and it's moving so fast
though i want to find
a love that's going to last
a love so strong
that i can withstand
the weight of the world
in the palm of its hand


will my love come in a bowl of fire?
will it be filled with hope and desire?
will my love come in a pouring rain?
am i ready for the joy, am i ready for the pain
am i ready for the boy, am i ready for this game
am i ready for the kiss, am i ready for the stars
am i ready for the bliss, am i ready for love
