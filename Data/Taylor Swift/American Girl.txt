well, she was an american girl
raised on promises
she couldn't help thinking that there was a little more to life
somewhere else

after all it was a great big world
with lots of places to run to
and if she had to die trying
she had one little promise she was going to keep


oh yeah, all right
take it easy baby
make it last all night
she was an american girl


well, it was kind of cold that night
she stood alone on her balcony
she could see the cars roll by
out on 441
like waves crashing on the beach
and for one desperate moment there
he crept back in her memory
god, it's so painful
it's something that's so close but still so far out of reach


oh yeah, all right
take it easy baby
make it last all night
she was an american girl


oh yeah, all right
take it easy baby
make it last all night
oh yeah, all right
take it easy baby
oh, take it easy now


oh yeah, all right
she was an american girl
