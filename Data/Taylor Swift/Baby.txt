i like the way you wanted me
every night for so long, baby
i like the way you needed me
every time the things got rocky, yeah


i was believing in you
was i mistaken?
do you mean
do you mean what you say?
when you say our love could last forever


well, i'd rather you be mean
than love and lie
i'd rather hear the truth
than have to say goodbye
i'd rather take a blow
at least then i would know
but baby don't you break my heart slow


i like the way you'd hold me
every night for so long, baby
i like the way you'd sing to me
every time the things got rocky, yeah


i was believing in you
was i mistaken?
do you say
do you say what you mean?
when you say our love could last forever



oh, yeah, yeah


you'd run around
and lead me on forever
while i stay at home
still thinking we're together
i want our love to last forever


but i'd rather you be mean
than love and lie
i'd rather hear the truth
than have to say goodbye
and i'd rather take a blow
at least then i would know
but baby don't you break my heart slow
now baby don't you break my heart
slow
