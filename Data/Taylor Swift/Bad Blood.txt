'cause, baby, now we got bad blood
you know it used to be mad love
so take a look what you've done
'cause, baby, now we got bad blood, hey
now we got problems
and i don't think we can solve them
you made a really deep cut
and, baby, now we got bad blood, hey


did you have to do this?
i was thinking that you could be trusted
did you have to ruin
what was shiny? now it's all rusted
did you have to hit me
where i'm weak? baby, i couldn't breathe
and rub it in so deep
salt in the wound like you're laughin' right at me


oh, it's so sad to
think about the good times
you and i

and i don't think we can solve them

and, baby, now we got bad blood, hey


did you think we'd be fine?
still got scars on my back from your knife
so don't think it's in the past
these kinda wounds, they last and they last
now, did you think it all through?
all these things will catch up to you
and time can heal, but this won't
so if you're comin' my way, just don't

think about the good times
you and i
