you turn your dial to 93.7
broadway acts like he's 11
self-proclaimed
say's he's the worst mistake ever to land in michigan
i'm just a singer of country songs
just trying to play guitar and not do no wrong
but if you listen to just one thing i say


you should turn z93 on
broadway's electric barnyard
i sing a song called "tim mcgraw"
request it and they'll play it all day long
i sing in stations all day long
but there's nothing like when you're on
the electric barnyard


daisy's from a trailer park in st. louis
growing up not wearing any shoes
prettiest hillbilly girl you'll see all day
growing up the other trailer park girls
couldn't hide their jealousy
because she had the only phone for miles
now she uses it as a dj


so you should turn z93 on

but there's nothing like when you're on
