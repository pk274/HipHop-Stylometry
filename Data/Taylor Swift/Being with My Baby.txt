all is quiet in the world tonight
counting stars and fireflies
and summer sings a lullaby
with me and my baby
on the hood of his daddy's car
we ass around his old guitar
bet mama's wondering where we are
it's just me and my baby


the world is spinning round
cause look just what i've found


ooh, life's so sweet right here
ooh, keeping it young and crazy
ooh, just want to stay right here
cause nothing's quite like being with my baby


driving home by the river side
wishing i could slow down time
and take a picture with my mind
of me and my baby
the car pulls up and i'm home too late
we didn't take that interstate
that back road was a better way
for me and my baby


the closer that we get
i know i can't leave yet


ooh, life's so sweet right here
ooh, keeping it young and crazy
ooh, just want to stay right here
cause nothing's quite like being with my baby


look at what we've found
so he turns that car around


ooh, life's so sweet right here
ooh, keeping it young and crazy
ooh, just want to stay right here
ooh, and be with my baby
ooh, yeah
keeping it young and crazy
oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
