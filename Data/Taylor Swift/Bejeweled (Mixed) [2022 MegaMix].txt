baby love, i think i've been a little too kind
didn't notice you walkin' all over my peace of mind
in the shoes i gave you as a present
puttin' someone first only works when you're in their top five
and by the way, i'm goin' out tonight


best believe i'm still bejeweled
when i walk in the room
i can still make the whole place shimmer
and when i meet the band
they ask, "do you have a man?"
i could still say, "i don't remеmber"
familiarity breeds contempt
don't put me in thе basement
when i want the penthouse of your heart
diamonds in my eyes
i polish up real, i polish up real nice


nice


baby boy, i think i've been too good of a girl (too good of a girl)
did all the extra credit, then got graded on a curve
i think it's time to teach some lessons
i made you my world (huh), have you heard? (huh)
i can reclaim the land
and i miss you (miss you), but i miss sparklin' (nice)


best believe i'm still bejeweled
when i walk in the room
i can still make the whole place shimmer
and when i meet the band
they ask, "do you have a man?"
i could still say, "i don't remember"
familiarity breeds contempt
don't put me in the basement
when i want the penthouse of your heart
diamonds in my eyes
i polish up real, i polish up real nice


that's right, it's the 2022 megamix, apple music, let's get it (nice)
