i wish i was
strong enough to
lift not one but
both of us
someday i will be
strong enough
to lift not one but
both of us (uh)


ever thought about losing it
when your money is all gone and you lose your whip (ooh-ooh)
you might lose your grip when the landlord tell you that you due for rent
and the grass so green on the other side
make a nigga wanna run straight through the fence
open up the fridge 'bout twenty times (ooh-ooh)
but you still can’t find no food in it, that’s foolishness
and sometimes i wonder why we care so much about the way we look (ooh-ooh)
and the way we talk and the way we act and the clothes we bought
how much that cost?
does it even really matter?
'cause if life is an uphill battle (ooh-ooh)
we all try to climb on the same old ladder
in the same boat, with the same ol’ paddle
why so shallow? i’m just askin'
what's the pattern to the madness? (ooh-ooh)
everybody in a #1 draft pick
most of us ain't hollywood actors
but if it’s all for one, and one for all
then maybe one day, we all could ball (ooh-ooh)
do it one time for the underdogs
sincerely yours, from one of y'all


i wish i was
strong enough to
lift not one but
both of us
some day i will be
strong enough to
lift not one but
both of us


i could feel your pain, i could feel your struggle (ooh-ooh)
you just wanna live, but everything's so low
that you could drown in a puddle
that’s why i gotta hold us up, yeah, hold us up
for all the times no one’s ever spoke for us (ooh-ooh)
to every single time that they play this song
you can say that, "that’s what bobby ray wrote for us"
when the tides get too high
and the sea up underneath gets so deep (ooh-ooh)
and you feel like you’re just another person
getting lost in the crowd, way up high in the nosebleeds, uh
because we've both been there, both of us
but we still stand tall with our shoulders up (ooh-ooh)
and even though we always against the odds
these are the things that’ve molded us
and if life hadn’t chosen us
sometimes i wonder where i would've wound up
'cause if it was up to me, i’d make a new blueprint
then build it from the ground up
hey, but if it’s all for one, and one for all
then maybe one day, we all could ball
do it one time for the underdogs
from bobby ray, to all of y’all


i wish i was
strong enough to
lift not one but
both of us
someday i will be
strong enough to
lift not one but
both of us


ooh-ooh, ooh
