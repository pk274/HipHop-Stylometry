watch me go into the world today
watch me try to blow the past away
watch me laugh and watch me cry
watch me fall and watch me fly


'cause i'm living in a brand new world
and you think i'm just another girl
but i'm living just a day at a time
and keeping it mine
someday, i'm gonna fly


watch me catch a star and pin it down
watch me live another time around
watch me doubt the things i love
watch me find what i'm proud of


'cause i'm living in a brand new world
and you think i'm just another girl
but i'm living just a day at a time
and keeping it mine
someday, i'm gonna fly


and i may break my wings
and fall flat on my shattered heart
and i may hit the ground
but i will never fall apart


'cause i'm living in a brand new world
and you think i'm just another girl
but i'm living just a day at a time
and keeping it mine


i'm living in a brand new world
and you think i'm just another girl
but i'm living just a day at a time
and keeping it mine
someday, i'm gonna fly
