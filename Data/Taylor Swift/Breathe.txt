i see your face in my mind as i drive away
'cause none of us thought it was gonna end that way
people are people and sometimes, we change our minds
but it's killing me to see you go after all this time


music starts playing like the end of a sad movie
it's the kind of ending you don't really wanna see
'cause it's tragedy and it'll only bring you down
now, i don't know what to be without you around


and we know it's never simple, never easy
never a clean break, no one here to save me
you're the only thing i know like the back of my hand


and i can't breathe without you, but i have to
breathe without you, but i have to


never wanted this, never wanna see you hurt
every little bump in the road, i tried to swerve
but people are people and sometimes, it doesn't work out
nothing we say is gonna save us from the fall out


and we know it's never simple, never easy
never a clean break, no one here to save me
you're the only thing i know like the back of my hand


and i can't breathe without you, but i have to
breathe without you but i have to


it's 2 a.m, feeling like i just lost a friend
hope you know it's not easy, easy for me
it's 2 a.m, feeling like i just lost a friend
hope you know this ain't easy, easy for me


and we know it's never simple, never easy
never a clean break, no one here to save me, oh-oh


i can't breathe without you, but i have to
breathe without you, but i have to
breathe without you, but i have to


i'm sorry, i'm sorry (mmm)
i'm sorry, (yeah, yeah) i'm sorry
i'm sorry, i'm sorry
i'm sorry
