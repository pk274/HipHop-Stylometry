here you are now
fresh from your war
back from the edge of time
and all that you were
stripped to the bone
i thought you'd want to know


that when you feel the world is crashing
all around your feet
come running headlong into my arms
breathless
i'll never judge you
i can only love you
come now running headlong
into my arms
breathless
breathless


lay down your guns
too weak to run
nothing can harm you here
your precious heart
broken and scarred
somehow you made it through
i only ask that you won't go again


when you feel the world is crashing
all around your feet
come running headlong into my arms
breathless
i'll never judge you
i can only love you
come now running headlong
into my arms
breathless


i'm so glad to see you smiling
so good to hear your laugh
i think that you've found you even
missed yourself
i'm only asking this because i think that
truth be told
oh, you'll never go again
again, again


when you feel the world is crashing
all around your feet
come running headlong into my arms
breathless
i'll never judge you
i can only love you
come now running headlong
into my arms
breathless
breathless


when you feel the world is crashing
come running into my arms
