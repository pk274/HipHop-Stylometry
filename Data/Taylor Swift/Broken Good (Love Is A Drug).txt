he put's his arm around me
but it just doesn't lay like yours
it weighs me down, weighs me down oh
and when he holds my hand it
never seems to fit the mold


i try to make it work but oh
you
you know you really broke me good
you know you broke me good
yeah, you
you know you broke me good
you know you broke me good


i'm broken, good
i'm broken, good
good, i'm broken good


the conversations empty
he doesn't get the jokes at all
so silent now, so silent now oh
and when i'm needing someone
he's not the onе i wanna call


i try to make it work but oh
you
you know you really broke mе good
you know you broke me good
yeah, you
you know you broke me good
you know you broke me good


i'm broken, good
i'm broken, good
good, i'm broken good


you know that love is a drug
you can't just leave when you wanna
and now i see what's its done
oh i know i'm broken, good


i'm broken, good
i'm broken, good
and now i see what it's done (good)
oh i know i'm broken


and now i see what it's done
oh i know i'm broken
