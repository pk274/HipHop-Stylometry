i was born in a barn in texas
down on an old winding road
and that's the story of how i learned
not to believe everything that i'm told


burn down the barn
and the photos we took
you think i'll forgive you
but you're not off the hook
you think i'll forgive you
but you're not off the hook


but despite all the warnings
and the lessons i learned
i trusted you
and then i got burned


burn down the barn
and the photos we took
you think i'll forgive you
but you're not off the hook
you think i'll forgive you
but you're not off the hook
