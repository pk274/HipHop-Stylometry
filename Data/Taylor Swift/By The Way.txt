i had to catch my breath
when i saw you there across the room, holding her hand
i'd have never guessed that starting over would look so good on you
but here i am
still believing there might come a day
we'll pick up where we left off


and by the way your eyes are dancing
i'd say the chances of that are getting slim
by the way my heart's still breaking
it's going to take it a while to love again
so many things that i forgot to say
by the way


i should've let you know all the ways you made me feel alive
i guess it's too late
so i'll just get my coat and make my way into this breezy night
give you one last wave
maybe you'll drop what you're doing and come over here to say
i'm looking good


but by the way your eyes are dancing
i'd say the chances of that are getting slim
by the way my heart's still breaking
it's going to take it a while to love again
so many things that i forgot to say


by the way, you still look amazing
and i must've been crazy to let you get away
by the way, if you ever wondered
still got the same old number, just in case
i still miss you and i still love you
by the way
by the way, oh
