any day now, they're talking war
i can see the look that's in your eyes
they're not talking a week or two
oh, daddy can i go with you?
oh, daddy can i go with you?


you pack a suitcase, take a picture from the wall
i always knew this time would come
when i ask how long you think you're going to be
you say, this crazy world's come undone


summer's over and leaves begin to fall
and another winter's on the way
i knew i wasn't going to take this very well
but i'd give anything to have you here today


everyday now they're talking war
& i know this time is like it's never been before
we're not talking about a week or two


oh, daddy can i go with you?
oh, daddy can i go with you?
oh, daddy can i go with you?
