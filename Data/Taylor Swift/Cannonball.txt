one thing i know, love isn’t easy
but it’s not this hard, yeah (yeah)
we built this love up so high and
we shot through it like a cannonball (cannonball, cannonball, cannonball)


i’m not here to play these games
now our love is not the same
and i know who you are


cause your love’s like a cannonball (cannonball, cannonball)
i don’t want to treat this love like a battle
there was a time i was on your side, but not anymore
your love’s like a cannonball (cannonball, cannonball)
cause no one wins, nobody gives you a medal
and both of us would take the fall
cause your love’s like a cannonball


hang up the phone
i’m pretty used to it
telling me it’s all my fault
and i was trying to blow you down (down)
and i always told you i don’t want to fight with you (fight with you)
but it looking like the wrong is always right with you (right with you)
and baby i don’t want to do this anymore, anymore, anymore


cause your love’s like a cannonball (cannonball, cannonball)
and i don’t want to treat this love like a battle
there was a time i was on your side, but not anymore
your love’s like a cannonball (cannonball, cannonball)
cause no one wins, nobody gives you a metal
and both of us would take the fall
cause your love’s like a cannonball


up and down, in and out
on and off, scream & shout
will she stay, will she go?
with a girl like that you never know
next time you call, you’ll hear nothing at all
cause i’ve been going like a cannonball


cause i’ve been going like a cannonball
so far away, away (cause i’ve been going like a cannonball, cannonball)
and it’s too late (cause i’ve been going like a cannonball, cannonball)
i’ve had all i can take, yeah (cause i’ve been going like a cannonball, cannonball)
and there’s nothing left to say (cause i’ve been going like a cannonball)
cannonball, cannonball, cannonball
