i don’t need a lot
but there's one thing
love has taught me
it’s to never expect too much
don’t need a believable touch
i just need you
i just need you
and i might, i found life
why should we be wasting time?


you don’t know what you missed
when i look into your eyes like this
and you should be in front of me
seeing everything to see
looking at you

think of a quiet beach
think of how the waves crash down
think about a summer’s eve
no offense to them but they ain't got nothing on you
walking with you
in the light or in the dark
well nothing shadows who you are


and you don’t know what you missed
when i look into your eyes like this
and you should be in front of me
seeing everything to see
looking at you
check out this view


i look outside the window
everyday see something new
but all i ever wanted was a
window looking at you, at you


and you don’t know what you missed
when i look into your eyes like this
and you should be in front of me
seeing everything to see
you don’t know what you missed
when i look into your eyes like this
and you should be in front of me
seeing everything to see
looking at you
