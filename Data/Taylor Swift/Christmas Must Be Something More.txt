what if ribbons and bows didn't mean a thing?
would the song still survive without five golden rings?
would you still wanna kiss without mistletoe?
what would happen if god never let it snow?
what would happen if christmas carols told a lie?
tell me, what would you find?


you'd see that today holds something special
something holy, not superficial
so here's to the birthday boy who saved our lives
it's something we all try to ignore
and put a wreath up on your door
so here's something you should know that is for sure
christmas must be something more


what if angels did not pay attention to
all the things that we wished they would always do?
what if happiness came in a cardboard box?
then i think there is something we all forgot
what would happen if presents all went away?
tell me, what would you find?


you'd see that today holds something special
something holy, not superficial
so here's to the birthday boy who saved our lives
it's something we all try to ignore
and put a wreath up on your door
so here's something you should know that is for sure
christmas must be something more


we get so caught up in all of it
business and relationships
hundred-mile-an-hour lives
and it's this time of year
and everybody's here
it seems the last thing on your mind


is that the day holds something special
something holy, not superficial
so here's to jesus christ who saved our lives
it's something we all try to ignore
and put a wreath up on your door
but here's something you should know that is for sure
christmas must be something
christmas must be something
christmas must be something more


there's gotta be more
there's gotta be more
