please take down the mistletoe
'cause i don't want to think about that right now
'cause everything i want is miles away
in a snow covered little town
my momma's in the kitchen, worrying about me
season's greetings, hope you're well
well i'm doing alright
if you were wondering
lately i can never tell


i know this shouldn't be a lonely time
but there were christmases when you were mine


i've been doing fine without you, really
up until the nights got cold
and everybody's here, except you, baby
seems like everyone's got someone to hold


but for me it's just a lonely time
'cause there were christmases when you were mine


merry christmas, everybody
that'll have to be something i just say this year
i'll bet you got your mom another sweater
and were your cousins late again?
when you were putting up the lights this year
did you notice one less pair of hands?


i know this shouldn't be a lonely time
but there were christmases when i didn't wonder how you are tonight
'cause there were christmases when you were mine


you were mine
