the drought was the very worst, ah-ah, ah-ah
when the flowers that we'd grown together died of thirst
it was months and months of back and forth, ah-ah, ah-ah
you're still all over me like a wine-stained dress i can't wear anymore


hung my head as i lost the war
and the sky turned black like a perfect storm


the rain came pouring down
when i was drownin', that's when i could finally breathe
and by mornin'
gone was any trace of you, i think i am finally clean


there was nothin' left to do, ah-ah, ah-ah
when the butterflies turned to dust that covered my whole room
so i punched a hole in the roof, ah-ah, ah-ah
let the flood carry away all my pictures of you


the water filled my lungs, i screamed so loud
but no one heard a thing


the rain came pouring down
when i was drownin', that's when i could finally breathe
and by mornin'
gone was any trace of you, i think i am finally clean


i think i am finally clean
ah-ah-ah-ah-ah
said, i think i am finally clean
ah-ah-ah-ah


ten months sober, i must admit
just because you're clean, don't mean you don't miss it
ten months older, i won't give in
now that i'm clean, i'm never gonna risk it
the drought was the very worst, ah-ah, ah-ah
when the flowers that we'd grown together died of thirst (oh)


the rain came pouring down
when i was drownin', that's when i could finally breathe
and by mornin'
gone was any trace of you, i think i am finally clean
the rain came pouring down
when i was drownin', that's when i could finally breathe
and by mornin'
gone was any trace of you, i think i am finally clean


finally clean
think i'm finally clean
ah-ah, ah-ah
think i'm finally clean
