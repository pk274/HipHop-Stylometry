i drive around this town
in a mustang with the top down
and six running horses under my hood
well that’s good enough for me
don’t need the real thing
that’s just another thing
for me to try to tame
don’t know if i could
it might just break me
i thought there for a little while
every sunset i’d be riding off with him


snap buttons on a denim shirt
blue jeans and a little dirt
that’s the closest you’ll see me
feet hanging out a pickup truck
crazy and a little rough
running free
that’s the closest to a cowboy
you’ll see me


before i met him
i was so sane and grounded
before he taught me how to lie
and crawl out the window
i learned the dirt roads
and i got my heart broken
cause that cowboy taught me how to cry
and how to let go
i thought there for a little while
every sunset i’d be riding off with him


snap buttons on a denim shirt
blue jeans and a little dirt
that’s the closest you’ll see me
feet hanging out a pickup truck
crazy and a little rough
running free
that’s the closest to a cowboy
you’ll see me


it was all a little
wonderful and strange
but i’ll never look
at a sunset the same night


snap buttons on a denim shirt
blue jeans and a little dirt
that’s the closest you’ll see me
feet hanging out a pickup truck
crazy and a little rough
running free
sitting fishing by the river bank
swimming in the water tank
that’s the closest you’ll see me
feet hanging out a pickup truck
crazy and a little rough
running free
that’s the closest to a cowboy
you’ll see me
