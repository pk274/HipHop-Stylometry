you said it in a simple way
4 a.m. the second day
how strange that i don't know you at all
stumbled through the long goodbye
one last kiss, then catch your flight
right when i was just about to fall


i told myself, don't get attached
but in my mind, i play it back
spinning faster than the plane that took you


and this is when the feeling sinks in
i don't wanna miss you like this
come back, be here, come back, be here
i guess you're in new york today
i don't wanna need you this way
come back, be here, come back, be here


the delicate beginning rush
the feeling you can know so much
without knowing anything at all
and now that i can put this down
if i had known what i know now
i never would've played so nonchalant


taxi cabs and busy streets
that never bring you back to me
i can't help but wish you took me with you


and this is when the feeling sinks in
i don't wanna miss you like this
come back, be here, come back, be here
i guess you're in london today
and i don't wanna need you this way
come back, be here, come back, be here


this is falling in love in the cruelest way
this is falling for you when you are worlds away
in new york, be here
but you're in london, and i break down
'cause it's not fair that you're not around


this is when the feeling sinks in
i don't wanna miss you like this
come back, be here, come back, be here
i guess you're in new york today
and i don't wanna need you this way
come back, be here, come back, be here


oh-oh, oh-oh
i don't wanna miss you like this
oh-oh, oh-oh
come back, be here
come back, be here
