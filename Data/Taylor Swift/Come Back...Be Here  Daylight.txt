you said it in a simple way
4 am, the second day
how strange that i don't know you at all
stumbled through the long goodbye
one last kiss, then catch your flight
right when i was just about to fall


i told myself, "don't get attached"
but in my mind, i play it back
spinning faster than the plane that took you


and this is when the feelin' sinks in
i don't wanna miss you like this
come back, be here
come back, be here
i guess you're in new york today
i don't wanna need you this way
come back, be here
come back, be here


the delicate beginnin' rush
thе feelin' you can know so much
without knowing anything at all
and now that i can put this down
if i had known what i know now
i never would've playеd so nonchalant


taxi cabs and busy streets
that never bring you back to me
i can't help but wish you took me with you


and this is when the feelin' sinks in
i don't wanna miss you like this
come back, be here
come back, be here
i guess you're in london today
and i don't wanna need you this way
come back, be here
come back, be here


oh, oh
oh, oh
oh, oh


this is falling in love in the cruelest way
this is fallin' for you when you are worlds away
in new york, be here
but you're in london and i break down
'cause it's not fair that you're not around


and i can still see it all in my mind
all of you, all of me intertwined
i once believed love would be black and white
but it's golden
and i can still see it all in my head
back and forth from new york, sneakin' in your bed
i once believed love would be burnin' red
but it's golden
like daylight, like daylight
like daylight, daylight


i don't wanna look at anything else now that i saw you
and i don't wanna think of anything else now that i thought of you
i've been sleepin' so long in a twenty-year dark night
and now i see daylight, i only see daylight


oh, and this is when the feelin' sinks in
i don't wanna miss you like this
come back, be here
come back, be here
i guess you're in new york today
and i don't wanna need you this way
come back, be here
come back, be here


oh, like daylight
oh
like daylight, daylight, daylight
like daylight, daylight, daylight, daylight
like daylight, daylight, daylight, daylight


my love was as cruel as the cities i lived in
everyone looked worse in the light
there were so many lines that i've crossed unforgiven
i'll tell you the truth but never goodbye


you gotta step into the daylight and let it go
just let it go
you gotta step into the daylight and let it go
just let it go, let it go
