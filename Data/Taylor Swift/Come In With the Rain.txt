i could go back to every laugh
but i don't wanna go there anymore
and i know all the steps up to your door
but i don't wanna go there anymore


talk to the wind, talk to the sky
talk to the man with the reasons why
and let me know what you find


i'll leave my window open
'cause i'm too tired at night to call your name
just know i'm right here hoping
that you'll come in with the rain


i could stand up and sing you a song
but i don't wanna have to go that far
and i, i've got you down, i know you by heart
and you don't even know where i start


talk to yourself, talk to the tears
talk to the man who put you here
and don't wait for the sky to clear


i'll leave my window open
'cause i'm too tired at night to call your name
just know i'm right here hoping
that you'll come in with the rain


i've watched you so long, screamed your name
i don't know what else i can say


but i'll leave my window open
'cause i'm too tired at night for all these games
just know i'm right here hoping
that you'll come in with the rain


i could go back to every laugh
but i don't wanna go there anymore
