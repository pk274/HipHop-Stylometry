i'd never gone with the wind, just let it flow
let it take me where it wants to go
'til you open the door, there's so much more
i'd never seen it before
i was tryin' to fly but i couldn't find wings
but you came along and you changed everything


you lift my feet off the ground
you spin me around
you make me crazier, crazier
feels like i'm fallin' and i am lost in your eyes
you make me crazier, crazier, crazier


i've watched from a distance as you made life your own
every sky was your own kind of blue
and i wanted to know how that would feel
and you made it so real
you showed me somethin' that i couldn't see
you opened my eyes
and you made me believe


you lift my feet off the ground
you spin me around
you make me crazier, crazier
feels like i'm fallin' and i am lost in your eyes
you make me crazier, crazier, crazier, oh


baby, you showed me what livin' is for
i don't wanna hide anymore
oh-oh


you lift my feet off the ground
you spin me around
you make me crazier, crazier
feels like i'm fallin' and i am lost in your eyes
you make me crazier, crazier, crazier
crazier, crazier
