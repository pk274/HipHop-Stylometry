i’ve been counting days, and i’ve been being patient
about a little thing called love
crossing all my fingers
letting my heart linger
trying to get some help from up above


i don’t want to jinx my luck
i’ve left it all behind me
and i’ve been hoping every day
that someday you will find me


so i cross my heart and hope for you
knock on wood and rope the moon
i’ll pray for you and me and hope i’m right
and i wait around that old wishing well
you never know if time will tell
i cross my heart and hope for you tonight


dreaming of you baby
i’ve been thinking maybe
there is something i can do
‘cause i’ve been on the verge of
running around in circles
baby all i want is you


i don’t want to jinx my luck
i’ve left it all behind me
and i’ve been hoping every day
that someday you will find me


so i cross my heart and hope for you
knock on wood and rope the moon
i’ll pray for you and me and hope i’m right
and i wait around that old wishing well
you never know if time will tell
i cross my heart and hope for you tonight


do you believe in miracles
please tell me if you’ve seen one
i’d like to know just where to go
because i think i need one


so i cross my heart and hope for you
knock on wood and rope the moon
i’ll pray for you and me and hope i’m right
and i wait around that old wishing well
you never know if time will tell
i cross my heart and hope for you tonight

so i cross my heart and hope for you
knock on wood and rope the moon
i’ll pray for you and me and hope i’m right
and i wait around that old wishing well
you never know if time will tell
i cross my heart and hope for you tonight
