he said, "i got me a nice new apartment
in the city, wouldn't you have hated that?
i'm getting by with a broken heart you left me with"
he hangs up the phone and she whispers back


missing you like this is such sweet sorrow
won't you come back to me?
i'll be here, today and here tomorrow
in dark blue tennessee


he was lying when he said he moved to l.a
he's just hiding out on the other side of town
with his head in his hands and she's just seven miles away
he's staring out the window and puts her picture down, saying


missing you like this is such sweet sorrow
won't you come back to me?
i'll be here, today and here tomorrow
in dark blue tennessee


she almost called him on the night that he wrote
these simple words on his goodbye note


missing you like this is such sweet sorrow
won't you come back to me?
i'll be here, today and here tomorrow
in dark blue tennessee
