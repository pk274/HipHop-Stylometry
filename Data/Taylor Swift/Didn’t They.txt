she walks to school
with her arms crossed
it's just another day
at 10 o clock she hears this screaming
then finally she sees them
it's scary how things change
and i saw the story on the news
i saw the footage from the roof
i sat down and cried


didn't she call you
didn't she need you bad enough
was there some reason
i'm not aware of
did you not write it down
just one more thing to do
where were you
and didn't she pray too


he kissed his wife goodbye
and took the earliest flight
so he could be home that night
to put his kids to sleep
down the aisle
three men walked and said
we're here to die for our god
he stood up and said that's funny
'cause my god died for me
i put the magazine down
i read his words out loud
i sat down and cried


and didn't he call you
didn't he need you bad enough
was there some reason
i'm not aware of
did you not write it down
just one more thing to do
where were you
and didn't he pray to oh


the taxis pulled up
on the very day of
they rode 100 floors up
just to come back down
they never thought they'd see the day
that the tower's up in flames
there was nothing left to say
when it all came down


and didn't they call you
didn't they need you bad enough
was there some reason
i'm not aware of
did you not write it down
just one more thing to do
where were you
where were you
and didn't they pray to
oh


i walk to school
and i wear a cross
i'm counting
every day
