don't blame me, love made me crazy
if it doesn't, you ain't doin' it right
lord, save me, my drug is my baby
i'll be usin' for the rest of my life


i've been breakin' hearts a long time
and toyin' with them older guys
just playthings for me to use
something happened for the first time
in the darkest little paradise
shaking, pacin', i just need you


for you, i would cross the line
i would waste my time
i would lose my mind
they say, "she's gone too far this time"


don't blame me, love made me crazy
if it doesn't, you ain't doin' it right
lord, save me, my drug is my baby
i'll be usin' for the rest of my life
don't blame me, love made me crazy
if it doesn't, you ain't doin' it right
oh, lord, save me, my drug is my baby
i'll be usin' for the rest of my life


i get so high, oh
every time you're, every time you're lovin' me
you're lovin' me
trip of my life, oh
every time you're, every time you're touchin' me
you're touchin' me
i get so high, oh
trip of my life, oh
every time you're, every time you're lovin' me


don't blame me, love made me crazy
if it doesn't, you ain't doin' it right (doin' it right, no)
lord, save me, my drug is my baby
i'll be usin' for the rest of my life, oh-oh
don't blame me, love made me crazy (oh-oh-oh)
if it doesn't, you ain't doin' it right (you ain't doin' it right)
oh, lord, save me, my drug is my baby
i'll be usin' for the rest of my life (i'll be usin', i'll be usin')
oh, every time you're, every time you're lovin' me
you're lovin' me


i don't like your little games
don't like your tilted stage
the role you made me play
of the fool, no, i don't like you
i don't like your perfect crime
how you laugh when you lie
you said the gun was mine
isn't cool, no, i don't like you (oh)


but i got smarter, i got harder in the nick of time
honey, i rose up from the dead, i do it all the time
i've got a list of names and yours is in red, underlined
i check it once, then i check it twice, oh!


ooh, look what you made me do
look what you made me do
look what you just made me do
look what you just made me
ooh, look what you made me do
look what you made me do
look what you just made me do
look what you just made me do


i don't like your kingdom keys
they once belonged to me
you asked me for a place to sleep
locked me out and threw a feast (what?)
the world moves on, another day, another drama, drama
but not for me, not for me, all i think about is karma
and then the world moves on, but one thing's for sure
maybe i got mine, but you'll all get yours


but i got smarter, i got harder in the nick of time
honey, i rose up from the dead, i do it all the time
i've got a list of names and yours is in red, underlined
i check it once, then i check it twice, oh!


ooh, look what you made me do
look what you made me do
look what you just made me do
look what you just made me
ooh, look what you made me do
look what you made me do
look what you just made me do
look what you just made me do


i don't trust nobody and nobody trusts me
i'll be the actress starring in your bad dreams
i don't trust nobody and nobody trusts me
i'll be the actress starring in your bad dreams
i don't trust nobody and nobody trusts me
i'll be the actress starring in your bad dreams
i don't trust nobody and nobody trusts me
i'll be the actress starring in your bad dreams
(ooh, look what you made me do
look what you made me do
look what you just made me do
look what you just made me
ooh, look what you made me do
look what you made me do
look what you just made me)
"i'm sorry, the old taylor can't come to the phone right now
"why? oh, 'cause she's dead!" (oh)


ooh, look what you made me do
look what you made me do
look what you just made me do
look what you just made me
ooh, look what you made me do
look what you made me do
look what you just made me do
look what you just made me do
ooh, look what you made me do
look what you made me do
look what you just made me do
look what you just made me
ooh, look what you made me do
look what you made me do
look what you just made me do
look what you just made me do
