my momma stood across the room
face to face but never eye to eye
recalling words we said
the battle that we swore
we'd never fight
breaking pieces off with every lie
a tear came to her eye
and she said


don't walk away now
and don't rip my heart out
don't you block me out tonight
honey where are you?
and don't hate me for loving you


he walked around my life
and made blind
with every single move
he caught me staring at him
mad about him
little that i knew
love is different
when you play the fool
and all i want to do is say


don't walk away now
and don't rip my heart out
don't you make cry tonight
like you always do
and don't hate me for loving you


i slammed the door
sat on the floor
cried into my bed
said are you there?
do you even care?
to cross above my head
but someone said


don't turn away now
and don't rip my heart out
things are meant to happen like this
i know it's right for you
and don't hate me for loving you


i looked up at the sky
face to face and finally
eye to eye
