here in my mind the sky looks the same
on every day you loved me
when we started home it started to rain
you put your coat around me
we stood there in the road
you held me so close
but did you ever let go


down came the rain
lightning and thunder
we tried in vain
to hold on to each other
winds of change blew you away from me
right here right now, i feel it on my skin
the bitter sting of what we could’ve been
just when our love was like a burning flame
down came the rain


in through the window i see her with you
i’m soaked to the skin, you’re warm and dry
i guess the storm is over for you
but look at the tears here in my eyes
i just stood there like a ghost
as you held her so close
and as i let you go


down came the rain
lightning and thunder
we tried in vain
to hold on to each other
winds of change blew you away from me
love like this changes who you are
every kiss you gave me is a scar
just when our love was like a burning flame
down came the rain


all i need is to move on fast
but all i want is to have you back
and it just keeps falling…


down came the rain
lightning and thunder
we tried in vain
to hold on to each other
winds of change blew you away from me
right here right now, i feel it on my skin
the bitter sting of what we could’ve been
just when our love was like a burning flame
down came the rain

down came the rain
