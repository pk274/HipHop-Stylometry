let's break it down, i’ll take the story from the slammin' of the door
thought it was perfect for a second, guess you weren't quite as sure
maybe i’m a little hard to get, maybe you didn't have the patience
let's assess the situation
that girl was biding her time, yeah, she was waiting on your cue
so, somehow, i'm not surprised to see her standin' there with you
maybe she's a little overdressed and i can see the smile you're fakin'
and the deep breath you’re takin’


when you see me now, you're not lookin’ at her
yeah, it's a long way down from the bridges you burned
might wanna sit down, i'm calling you out
right now


you're a heartbreaker and she’s a little drama queen
i'm a little over it and she's still not me
so long and back to reality
but this song's for you and your drama queen


as i was saying, i was never quite a fan of little games
it doesn't take too long to see that boys like you are all the same
maybe i'm a little less obsessed, but she's impressed
and i should mention, she's starving for attention


i can see it now, how it's all gonna be
when she freaks out, you'll be thinkin' of me
'cause what went down is coming back around
you'll see


'cause you're a heartbreaker and she's a little drama queen
i'm a little over it and she's still not me
so long and back to reality
but this song's for you and your drama queen


sometimes you get just what you see
like, you chose her when you could've had me
everything's a mess now, watch her little meltdown
wish you both success and i hope you're happy


'cause you're a heartbreaker, she's a little drama queen
i'm a little over it and she's still not me
so long and back to reality
but this song's for you and your drama
heartbreaker and she's a little drama queen
i'm a little over it and she's still not me
so long and back to reality
but this song's for you and your drama queen


huh-oh, for you and your drama queen
oh-oh-oh-oh, you and your drama queen
huh-oh, baby, you're a drama queen
