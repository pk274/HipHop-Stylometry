i wanna be your end game
i wanna be your first string
i wanna be your a-team (woah, woah)
i wanna be your end game, end game


i don't wanna touch you (i don't wanna be)
just another ex-love (you don’t wanna see)
i don’t wanna miss you (i don't wanna miss you)
like the other girls do
i don’t wanna hurt you (i just wanna be)
drinkin' on the beach with (you all over me)
i know what they all say (i know what they all say)
but i ain't tryna play


i wanna be your end game (end game)
i wanna be your first string (first string)
i wanna be your a-team (a-team)
i wanna be your end game, end game


i don't wanna touch you (i don't wanna be)
just another ex-love (you don't wanna see)
i don't wanna miss you (i don't wanna miss you)
like the other girls do
i don't wanna hurt you (i just wanna be)
drinkin' on the beach with (you all over me)
i know what they all say (yeah)
but i ain't tryna play (ooh)


i wanna be your end game (end game)
i wanna be your first string (wanna be your first string)
i wanna be your a-team (a-team)
i wanna be your end game, end game


i hit you like bang, we tried to forget it, but we just couldn't
and i bury hatchets, but i keep maps of where i put 'em
reputation precedes me, they told you i'm crazy
i swear i don't love the drama, it loves me
and i can't let you go, your handprints on my soul
it's like your eyes are liquor, it's like your body is gold
you've been callin' my bluff on all my usual tricks
so here's the truth from my red lips (ooh, ah)


i wanna be your end game (end game)
i wanna be your first string (me and you; first string)
i wanna be your a-team (hey; be your a-team now; a-team)
i wanna be your end game, end game
i wanna be your end game (oh, i do; end game)
i wanna be your first string (first string)
i wanna be your a-team (a-team)
i wanna be your end game, end game
