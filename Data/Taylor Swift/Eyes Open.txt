everybody's waiting
everybody's watching
even when you're sleeping
keep your eyes open


the tricky thing is yesterday we were just children
playing soldiers, just pretending
dreaming dreams with happy endings
in backyards, winning battles with our wooden swords
but now we've stepped into a cruel world
where everybody stands and keeps score
keep your eyes open


everybody's waiting for you to break down
everybody's watching to see the fallout
even when you're sleeping, sleeping
keep your eyes open
keep your eyes open
keep your eyes open


so here you are, two steps ahead and staying on guard
every lesson forms a new scar
they never thought you'd make it this far
but turn around (turn around)
oh, they've surrounded you, it's a showdown (showdown)
and nobody comes to save you now
but you got something they don't
yeah, you got something they don't


you just gotta keep your eyes open


everybody's waiting for you to break down
everybody's watching to see the fallout
even when you're sleeping, sleeping
keep your eyes open
keep your eyes open
keep your eyesâ€”


keep your feet ready, heartbeat steady
keep your eyes open
keep your aim locked, the night goes dark
keep your eyes open
(keep your eyes open)
(keep your eyes open)
(keep your eyes open)
(keep your eyes open)


everybody's waiting for you to break down
everybody's watching to see the fallout
even when you're sleeping, sleeping
keep your eyes open
keep your eyes open
keep your eyes open
keep your eyes open
keep your eyes open
