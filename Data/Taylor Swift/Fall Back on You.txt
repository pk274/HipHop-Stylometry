isn't it funny how many times we can say
we've drawn the line, crossed it out, turned the page
and moved on
that's what we thought
but here i am in the same old car
having myself another same old brown-eyed thought
uh oh, uh oh


i won't tell nobody
i won't tell my friends
we'll just drive down this road 'til the one we're on ends
and we'll tell each other things like i need you


you and me
baby this is what we do
i finally see
there are people you just come back to
so fall back on me
i'll fall back on you


we always let someone come in between
talk around the truth and never say what we mean
look at all this wasted time


you won't tell nobody
i won't tell my friends
we'll just drive down this road and pray it doesn't end
and we'll tell each other things like i love you


you and me
baby this is what we do
i finally see
there are people that you come back to
so fall back on me
i'll fall back on you


maybe we'll last
maybe we won't
maybe we'll stop talking and i'll haunt you like a ghost
but just maybe, you belong with me


you and me
baby this is what we do
i finally see
there are people that you come back to
so fall back on me
baby, i'll fall back on you
fall back on me
baby, baby, i'll fall back on you
fall back on you, ooh, ooh
fall back on you
