asking you questions is like asking for lies
"won't happen no more"
yeah, i’ve heard that before


runnin' round in circles isn't my game
i tried to make it work but i end up getting burnt


by the fire
leading on a life with a tear in my eye
and i know
oh, i should’ve learned, but i guess it's my turn
to try to put out your fire


giving you answers to my trivial heart
it's hard to break the chains that i can't pull apart


runnin' round in circles ain't nobody's game
i tried to make it work but i keep up getting hurt


by the fire
leading on a life with a tear in my eye
and i know
oh, i should've learned, but i guess it’s my turn
to try to put out your fire


your flames
oh, they’re putting me out
the smoke
yeah, 
tryna put out your fire
leading on a life with a tear in my eye
and i know
oh, i should've learned, but i guess it’s my turn
to try to put out your fire


oh, i should've learned, but i guess it's my turn
to try to put out your fire
tryna put out your
tryna put out your fire
