it would've been nice to see you coming
but that would've ruined the surprise
it would've been nice to have a picture perfect world
but then the truth would hurt my eyes
it would've been good for you to be there
and every time you always would
everything seems to have a picture perfect time
and nothing seems to be a blur


it's hard to see a picture drop before it hits the ground
it's nice to know you're here and you're helping me down
but you were always there when i needed
you would always see me clearly
and you were never looking for a thank you
i'm saying one for you


would've been cool to never fall down
but then i never would've seen
the power isn't with the picture perfect person
you told me better things to come from in between

i'm saying one, saying one, saying one for you
