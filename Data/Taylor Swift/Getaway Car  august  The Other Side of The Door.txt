no, nothin' good starts in a getaway car


it was the best of times, the worst of crimes
i struck a match and blew your mind
but i didn't mean it and you didn't see it
the ties were black, the lies were white
in shades of gray in candlelight
i wanted to leave him, i needed a reason


"x" marks the spot where we fell apart
he poisoned the well, i was lyin' to myself
i knew it from the first old fashioned, we were cursed
we never had a shotgun shot in the dark


you were drivin' the getaway car
we were flyin', but we'd never get far
don't pretend it's such a mystery
think about the place where you first met me
ridin' in a getaway car
there were sirens in the beat of your heart
shoulda known i'd be the first to leave
think about the place where you first met me


in a getaway car, oh-oh-oh
no, they never get far, oh-oh
no, nothin' good starts in a getaway car


it was the great escape, the prison break
the light of freedom on my face
but you weren't drinkin' and i was just thinkin'
while he was runnin' after us, i was screamin', "go, go, go"
but with three of us, honey, it's a sideshow
and a circus ain't a love story and now we're both sorry, we're both sorry


"x" marks the spot where we fell apart
he poisoned the well, every man for himself
i knew it from the first old fashioned, we were cursed
it hit you like a shotgun shot to the heart


you were drivin' the getaway car
we were flyin', but we'd never get far
don't pretend it's such a mystery
think about the place where you first met me
ridin' in a getaway car
there were sirens in the beat of your heart
shoulda known i'd be the first to leave
think about the place where you first met me


in a getaway car, oh-oh-oh)
no, they never get far, oh-oh
no, nothin' good starts in a getaway car


i can see us lost in the memory
august slipped away into a moment in time
'cause it was never mine
and i can see us twisted in bedsheets
august sipped away like a bottle of wine
'cause you were never mine


we were jet-set, bonnie and clyde
until i switched to the other side, to the other side
it's no surprise i turned you in
'cause us traitors never win


drivin' the getaway car
shoulda known i'd be the first to leave
think about the place where you first met me


in a getaway car, oh-oh-oh
no, they never get far, oh-oh
no, nothin' good starts in a getaway car


i was ridin' in a getaway car
i was cryin' in a getaway car
i was dyin' in a getaway car
said goodbye in a getaway car
ridin' in a getaway car
i was cryin' in a getaway car
i was dyin' in a getaway car
said goodbye in a getaway car


with your face and the beautiful eyes
and the conversation with the little white lies
and the faded picture of a beautiful night
you carried me from your car up the stairs
and i broke down cryin', was she worth this mess?
after everything and that little black dress
after everything, i must confess
i need you
