oh half of my heart's got a grip on the situation
half of my heart takes time
half of my heart's got a right mind to tell you
that i can't keep loving you (can't keep loving you)
oh, with half of my heart


oh half of my heart's got a grip on the situation
half of my heart takes time
half of my heart's got a right mind to tell you
that i can't keep loving you (can't keep loving you)
oh, with half of my heart


half of my heart’s got a real cool imagination
half of my heart’s got you
half of my heart’s got the right mind to tell you
half of my heart won’t do
