you and i walk a fragile line
i have known it all this time
but i never thought i'd live to see it break
it's getting dark and it's all too quiet
and i can't trust anything now
and it's coming over you like it's all a big mistake


woah, holding my breath
won't lose you again
something's made your eyes go cold


come on, come on, don't leave me like this
i thought i had you figured out
something's gone terribly wrong
you're all i wanted
come on, come on, don't leave me like this
i thought i had you figured out
can't breathe whenever you're gone
can't turn back now, i'm haunted


stood there and watched you walk away
from everything we had
but i still mean every word i said to you
he will try to take away my pain
and he just might make me smile
but the whole time, i'm wishing he was you instead


oh, holding my breath
won't see you again
something keeps me holding onto nothing


come on, come on, don't leave me like this
i thought i had you figured out
something's gone terribly wrong
you're all i wanted
come on, come on, don't leave me like this
i thought i had you figured out
can't breathe whenever you're gone
can't turn back now, i'm haunted


i know, i know
i just know
you're not gone
you can't be gone, no


come on, come on, don't leave me like this
i thought i had you figured out
something's gone terribly wrong
won't finish what you started
come on, come on, don't leave me like this
i thought i had you figured out
can't breathe whenever you're gone
i can't go back, i'm haunted


oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh
you and i walk a fragile line
i have known it all this time
never ever thought i'd see it break
never thought i'd see it
