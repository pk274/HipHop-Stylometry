here you come again
just when i'd begun to get myself together
you waltz right in the door
just like you've done before
and wrap my heart 'round your little finger


here you come again
just when i'm about to make it work without you
you look into my eyes
and lie those pretty lies
and pretty soon i'm wondering' how i came to doubt you


all you got to do is smile that smile
and there go all my defenses
just leave it up to you and in a little while
you're messing' up my mind and filling' up my senses


here you come again
looking' better than a body has a right to
and shaking' me up so that all i really know
is here you come again
and here i go

here i go
and here i go
and here i go
here you come again
and here i go
here i go
and here i go
here i go
