mmm-mm, mm-mm
mmm-mm, mm-mm
mmm-mm, mm-mm, yeah


hey, stephen, i know looks can be deceiving
but i know i saw a light in you
and as we walked, we were talking
i didn't say half the things i wanted to
of all the girls tossing rocks at your window
i'll be the one waiting there even when it's cold
hey, stephen, boy, you might have me believing
i don't always have to be alone


'cause i can't help it if you look like an angel
can't help it if i wanna kiss you in the rain so
come feel this magic i've been feeling since i met you
can't help it if there's no one else
mmm, i can't help myself


hey, stephen, i've been holding back this feeling
so i got some things to say to you, ha
i've seen it all, so i thought
but i never seen nobody shine the way you do
the way you walk, way you talk, way you say my name
it's beautiful, wonderful, don't you ever change
hey, stephen, why are people always leaving?
i think you and i should stay the same


'cause i can't help it if you look like an angel
can't help it if i wanna kiss you in the rain so
come feel this magic i've been feeling since i met you
can't help it if there's no one else
mmm, i can't help myself


they're dimming the street lights, you're perfect for me
why aren't you here tonight?
i'm waiting alone now, so come on and come out
and pull me near and shine, shine, shine


i can't help it if you look like an angel
can't help it if i wanna kiss you in the rain so
come feel this magic i've been feeling since i met you
can't help it if there's no one else
mmm, i can't help myself
if you look like an angel
can't help it if i wanna kiss you in the rain so
come feel this magic i've been feeling since i met you
can't help it if there's no one else
mmm, i can't help myself


myself
can't help myself
i can't help myself
