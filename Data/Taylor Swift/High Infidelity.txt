lock broken, slur spoken
wound open, game token
i didn't know you were keeping count
rain soaking, blind hoping
you said i was freeloading
i didn't know you were keeping count


high infidelity
put on your records and regret me
i bent the truth too far tonight
i was dancing around, dancing around it
high infidelity
put on your headphones and burn my city
your picket fence is sharp as knives
i was dancing around, dancing around it


storm coming, good husband
bad omen
dragged my feet right down the aisle
at the house lonely, good money
i'd pay if you'd just know me
seemed like the right thing at the time


high infidelity
put on your records and regret me
i bent the truth too far tonight
i was dancing around, dancing around it
high infidelity
put on your headphones and burn my city
your picket fence is sharp as knives
i was dancing around, dancing around it


high infidelity
put on your records and regret meeting me
i bent the truth too far tonight
i was dancing around, dancing around it
high infidelity
put on your headphones and burn my city
your picket fence is sharp as knives
i was dancing around, dancing around it


oh, there's many different ways that you can kill the one you love
and it's never enough, it's never enough


lock broken, slur spoken
wound open, game token
i didn't know you were keeping count
rain soaking, blind hoping
you said i was freeloading
i didn't know you were keeping count
but, oh, you were keeping count
