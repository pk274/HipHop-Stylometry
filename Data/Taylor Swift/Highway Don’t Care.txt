i can't live without you, i can't live without you, baby
i can't live without you, i can't live without you, baby, oh, baby


i bet you got a dead cell phone in your shotgun seat
yeah, i bet you're bending god's ear talking 'bout me
you're trying not to let the first tear fall out
you're trying not to think about turning around
you're trying not to get lost in the sound but that song is always on
so you sing along


i can't live without you, i can't live without you, baby
i can't live without you, i can't live without you, baby, oh baby


i can't live without you, i can't live without you, baby
i can't live without you, i can't live without you, baby, oh baby


the highway don't care
the highway don't care
the highway don't care
but i do, i do
i can't live without you, i can't live without you, baby
i can't live without i can't live without you, baby, oh baby
the highway don't care
the highway don't care
the highway don't care
but i do, i do
i can't live without you, i can't live without you, baby
i can't live without i can't live without you, baby
the highway don't care
the highway don't care
the highway don't care
but i do, i do
i can't live without you, i can't live without you, baby
i can't live without i can't live without you, baby, oh baby
the highway don't care
the highway don't care
the highway don't care
but i do, i do


i can't live without you, i can't live without you, baby
