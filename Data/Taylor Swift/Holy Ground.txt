i was reminiscing just the other day
while having coffee all alone, and lord, it took me away
back to a first-glance feeling on new york time
back when you fit in my poems like a perfect rhyme
took off faster than a green light, go
hey, you skip the conversation when you already know
i left a note on the door with a joke we'd made
and that was the first day


and darling, it was good
never looking down
and right there where we stood
was holy ground


spinning like a girl in a brand new dress
we had this big wide city all to ourselves
we blocked the noise with the sound of, "i need you"
and for the first time, i had something to lose
and i guess we fell apart in the usual way
and the story's got dust on every page
but sometimes, i wonder how you think about it now
and i see your face in every crowd


'cause darling, it was good
never looking down
and right there where we stood
was holy ground


tonight, i'm gonna dance
for all that we've been through
but i don't wanna dance
if i'm not dancing with you
tonight, i'm gonna dance
like you were in this room
but i don't wanna dance
if i'm not dancing with you


it was good
never looking down
and right there where we stood
was holy ground


tonight, i'm gonna dance
for all that we've been through
but i don't wanna dance
if i'm not dancing with you
tonight, i'm gonna dance
like you were in this room
but i don't wanna dance
if i'm not dancing with you
