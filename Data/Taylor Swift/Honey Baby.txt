i think of you every single evening
as i lay awake at night
i try to think; try to walk away with you...me in
and i say



honey baby don't do nothing crazy
when i say that everything will be fine!
oh, honey baby, oh
how can you blame me
when i say i wanna make you mine?
cause everybody else in the world is driving me crazy
except you, honey baby!
oh!



flying high, i can see his smiling
as we walk down by the drives
take my hand, take my breath away
cause you make me feel like flying!



honey baby don't do nothing crazy
when i say that everything will be fine!
oh, honey baby, oh
how can you blame me
when i say i wanna make you mine?
cause everybody else in the world is driving me crazy
except you, honey baby!


oh, you are everything i'll never need
oh, you are everything i wanna be!
drive me crazy, have me baby
all i really wanna say is


honey baby don't do nothing crazy
when i say that everything will be fine!
oh, honey baby, oh
how can you blame me
when i say i wanna make you mine?
cause everybody else in the world is driving me crazy
except you, honey baby!
