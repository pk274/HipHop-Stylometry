guess mine is not the first heart broken
my eyes are not the first to cry
i'm not the first to know
there's just no getting over you
you know i'm just a fool who's willing
to sit around and wait for you
but, baby, can't you see
there's nothing else for me to do?
i'm hopelessly devoted to you


but now there's nowhere to hide
since you pushed my love aside
i'm out of my head
hopelessly devoted to you
hopelessly devoted to you
hopelessly devoted to you


my head is saying, "fool, forget him"
my heart is saying, "don't let go
hold on till the end"
and that's what i intend to do
i'm hopelessly devoted to you


but now there's nowhere to hide
since you pushed my love aside
i'm out of my head
hopelessly devoted to you
hopelessly devoted to you
hopelessly devoted to you
