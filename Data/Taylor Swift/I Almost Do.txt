i bet this time of night, you’re still up
i bet you’re tired from a long, hard week
i bet you’re sittin' in your chair by the window
looking out at the city, and i bet
sometimes, you wonder 'bout me


and i just wanna tell you
it takes everything in me not to call you
and i wish i could run to you
and i hope you know that
every time i don’t, i almost do, i almost do


i bet you think i either moved on or hate you
‘cause each time you reach out, there’s no reply
i bet it never, ever occurred to you
that i can’t say hello to you and risk another goodbye


and i just wanna tell you
it takes everything in me not to call you
and i wish i could run to you
and i hope you know that
every time i don’t, i almost do, i almost do


oh, we made quite a mess, babe
it’s probably better off this way
and i confess, babe
in my dreams, you’re touching my face
and asking me if i want to try again with you
and i almost do


and i just wanna tell you
it takes everything in me not to call you
and i wish i could run to you
and i hope you know that
every time i don’t, i almost do, i almost do


i bet this time of night, you’re still up
i bet you’re tired from a long, hard week
i bet you’re sittin' in your chair by the window
looking out at the city, and i hope
sometimes, you wonder 'bout me
