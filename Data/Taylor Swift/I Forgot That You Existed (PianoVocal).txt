so the clip that you're about to hear is my preparation for a writing session. i was writing with two writers i hadn't ever worked with before, so i wanted to come in with an idea that was pretty much all there, melody and lyrics. and so i had this idea called "i forgot that you existed", and i wanted it to be really simple. i thought it might be a really fun way to open the album, like, basically kind of shrugging off a lot of things that you've been through that have been causing a lot of struggle and pain and just, one day, you wake up and you realize you're indifferent to whatever caused you that pain. and so this is a clip of me just trying to tinkering around on the piano, trying to figure out exactly what i wanted to do with it, and you can hear the end result on the album, but this is where it started
