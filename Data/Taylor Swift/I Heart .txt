wish i had concentrated
they said love was complicated
but it's something i just fell into
and it was overrated
but just look what i've created
i came out alive but i'm black and blue


before you ask me if iâ€™m alright
think about what i had to do, yeah


wake up and smell the breakup
fix my heart, put on my makeup
another mess i didn't plan
and i'll bet you thought you'd beat me
wish you could only see
i got an "i heart question mark"
written on the back of my hand


i'd be fine if you just walked by
but you had to talk about why
you were wrong and i was right
but i can't believe you made me
sit at home, cry like a baby
wait right by the phone every night


and now you ask about you and i
there's no you and i
remember what you put me through, i had to


wake up and smell the breakup
fix my heart, put on my makeup
another mess i didn't plan
and i'll bet you thought you'd beat me
wish you could only see
i got an "i heart question mark"
written on the back of my hand


and when you're home all alone at night
you'll still wonder why
you took everything i had, oh, baby
i haven't thought about you and i
there's no you and i
and i know someday you will


wake up and smell the breakup
realize that we won't make up
it didn't go the way you planned
and you'll know you didn't beat me
when you look down and see
i got an "i heart question mark"
written on the back of my hand


written on the back of my hand
an "i heart question mark," yeah
written on the back of my hand
