i like my music loud
i like my windows down
so i can scream
i like my trucks a little
bigger than the rest
so i can see
don't try me
don't fight me
you be you and i'll be me


they say i've always known
what i wanted
my friends and enemies
will tell you it's true
you will find out
i always get it
i know what i want
and it ain't you


your mom and daddy's walls
are covered up in pictures of you
you never met a mirror
that you didn't look again into
so sorry, don't worry
i'm sure there are so many girls
who love you like you do


they say i've always known
what i wanted
my friends and enemies
will tell you it's true
you will find out
i always get it
i know what i want
and it ain't you
it ain't you, oh


oh baby, don't persuade me
i know that you ain't used to no
so let me say it real slow


they say i've always known
what i wanted, it's true
my friends and enemies
will tell you it's true
you will find out
i always get it
i know what i want
and they say i've always known
what i wanted
my friends and enemies
will tell you it's true
and you'll find out
i always get it
i know what i want
and it ain't you
