... i used to fly
didn't matter where i'd been
'cause i'd seen the sky
i wanna tell you why
but somehow i know i
would break down and cry


i know you can't see me here
but i am not alone
i'm lying here in invisible arms
and i won't be alone tonight


you... you know i would die
before i let them see me
see me cry
please don't leave tonight
oh let me down slowly
show me a light


i know you can't see me here
but i am not alone
i'm lying here in invisible arms
and i won't be alone tonight


oh let me think i'm strong
please don't bring me down
i need you tonight


i know you can't see me here
but i am not alone
i'm lying here in invisible arms
and i won't be alone tonight


i... i used to fly
didn't matter where i'd been
'cause i'd seen the sky
