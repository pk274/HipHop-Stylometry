throwing pennies at the fountain
when you're standing on a mountain
it's kind of hard to aim
like the tree we carved our names in
there must be an explanation
guess it didn't get enough rain
i need reasons why you're leaving


well i guess i wished on a plane
i thought it was a star
i guess what you wrote on paper
wasn't written on your heart
could've sworn you said you loved me
i guess i heard you wrong
and i guess i wished on a plane
that i thought was a star


diving off into the deep end
honestly believed you'd be there
when i jumped in
guess it ain't your territory
we had the perfect love story
except the ending
nothing comes true
when it comes to you, oh


well i guess i wished on a plane
i thought it was a star
i guess what you wrote on paper
wasn't written in your heart
could've sworn you said you loved me
i guess i heard you wrong
and i guess i wished on a plane
that i thought was a star


the night was so cloudy
it's not my fault
i just couldn't see


and i guess i wished on a plane
i thought it was a star
guess what you wrote on paper
wasn't written in your heart
could've sworn you said you loved me
i guess i heard you wrong
and i guess i wished on a plane
that i thought was a star


throwing pennies at the fountain
when you're standing on a mountain
it's kind of hard to aim
