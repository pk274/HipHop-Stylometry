good to each other, give it the summer
i knew, you too
but i only saw you once in december
i'm still confused


you said, "forever," and i almost bought it
i miss fighting in your old apartment
breaking dishes when you're disappointed
i still love you, i promise
nothing happened in the way i wanted
every corner of this house is haunted
and i know you said that we're not talking
but i miss you, i'm sorry


i don't wanna go, think i'll make it worse
everything i know brings me back to us
i don't wanna go, we've been here before
everywhere i go leads me back to you
i don't wanna go, think i'll make it worse
everything i know brings me back to us
i don't wanna go, we've been here before
everywhere i go


you said, "forever," in the end i fought it (i don't wanna go, think i'll make it worse)
please be honest, are we better for it? (everything i know brings me back to us)
thought you'd hate me, but instead you called (i don't wanna go, we've been here before)
and said, "i miss you"
well, i caught it (everywhere i go leads me back to you)
nothing happened in the way i wanted (i don't wanna go, think i'll make it worse)
every corner of this house is haunted (everything i know brings me back to us)
and i know you said that we're not talking (i don't wanna go)
but i miss you, i'm sorry


i don't wanna go, think i'll make it worse
everything i know brings me back to us
i don't wanna go, we've been here before
everywhere i go leads me back to you
