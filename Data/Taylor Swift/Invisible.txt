she can't see the way your eyes
light up when you smile
she'll never notice how you stop and stare
whenever she walks by


and you can't see me wanting you the way you want her
but you are everything to me


and i just wanna show you
she don't even know you
she's never gonna love you like i want to
and you just see right through me
but if you only knew me
we could be a beautiful miracle, unbelievable
instead of just invisible


oh, yeah, oh


there's a fire inside of you
that can't help but shine through
she's never gonna see the light
no matter what you do


and all i think about is how to make you think of me
and everything that we could be


and i just wanna show you
she don't even know you
she's never gonna love you like i want to
and you just see right through me
but if you only knew me
we could be a beautiful miracle, unbelievable
instead of just invisible


like shadows in a faded light
oh, we're invisible
i just wanna open your eyes
and make you realize


i just wanna show you
she don't even know you
baby, let me love you, let me want you
you just see right through me
but if you only knew me
we could be a beautiful miracle, unbelievable
instead of just invisible


oh, yeah


she can't see the way your eyes
light up when you smile
