to the left, to the left, everything you own in the box to the left
in the closet, that's my stuff, yes, i bought it
please don't touch


keep talking and yes, that's fine
could you walk and talk at the same time?
and it's my name that's on the tag
come in with your bags, let me call you a cab


standing in the front yard, telling me how i'm such a fool
how i'm never gonna find a man like you, got me twisted


you must not know about me
you must not know about me
i can have another you in a minute
matter of fact, he'll be here in a minute, baby
you must not know about me
you must not know about me
i can have another you by tomorrow
so don't you, ever for a second, get to thinking
you're irreplaceable


so, go ahead and get gone
call up that chick and see if she's home
oops, i bet you thought that i didn't know
what'd you think i was putting you out for?
'cause you were untrue, hauling her around in the truck that i bought you
baby, drop them keys, hurry up before your taxi leaves


standing in the front yard, telling me how i'm such a fool
talking about, how i'm never gonna find a man like you
got me twisted


you must not know about me
you must not know about me
i can have another you in a minute
matter of fact, he'll be here in a minute, baby
you must not know about me
you must not know about me
i can have another you by tomorrow
so don't you, ever for a second, get to thinking
you're irreplaceable
