i don't think that passenger seat
has ever looked this good to me
he tells me about his night
and i count the colors in his eyes
he'll never fall in love, he swears
as he runs his fingers through his hair
i’m laughing 'cause i hope he's wrong
and i don't think it ever crossed his mind
he tells a joke, i fake a smile
but i know all his favorite songs


and i could tell you his favorite color's green
he loves to argue, born on the seventeenth
his sister's beautiful, he has his father's eyes
and if you asked me if i love him
i'd lie


he looks around the room
innocently overlooks the truth
shouldn't a light go on?
doesn't he know that i've had him memorized for so long?
he sees everything in black and white
never let nobody see him cry
i don't let nobody see me wishin' he was mine


i could tell you his favorite color's green
he loves to argue, born on the seventeenth
his sister's beautiful, he has his father's eyes
and if you asked me if i love him
i'd lie


he stands there, then walks away
my god, if i could only say
i'm holding every breath for you
he'd never tell you, but he can play guitar
i think he can see through everything but my heart
first thought when i wake up
is, "my god, he’s beautiful"
so i put on my makeup
and pray for a miracle


yes, i could tell you his favorite color's green
he loves to argue, oh, and it kills me
his sister's beautiful, he has his father's eyes
and if you asked me if i love him
if you asked me if i love him
i’d lie
