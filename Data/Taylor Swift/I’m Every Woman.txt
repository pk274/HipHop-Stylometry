i'm every woman
it's all in me
anything you want done baby
i do it naturally


i'm every woman
it's all in me
i can read your thoughts right now
every one, from a to z


i can cast a spell
see, but you can't tell
mix a special groove
put fire inside of you
anytime you feel danger or fear
then instantly
i will appear


i'm every woman
it's all in me
anything you want done baby
i do it naturally


i'm every woman
it's all in me
i can read your thoughts right now
every one, from a to z


i can set your knees
like playing unto the seas
i can make a rhyme of confusion in your mind
and when it comes down to some good old fashioned love
i got it, i got it
i got it, got it, yeah, yeah


i'm every woman
it's all in me
anything you want done baby
i do it naturally


i'm every woman
it's all in me
i can read your thoughts right now
every one, from a to z


i'm every woman (every woman)
it's all in me
anything you want done baby
i do it naturally


anything you want
i'm every woman
it's all in me (yeah, oh, yeah)
i can read your thoughts right now
every one, from a to z
yeah, oh
i'm every woman
it's all in me
