friday night beneath the stars
in a field behind your yard
you and i are painting pictures in the sky
and sometimes, we don't say a thing
just listen to the crickets sing
everything i need is right here by my side


and i know everything about you
i don't wanna live without you


i'm only up when you're not down
don't wanna fly if you're still on the ground
it's like no matter what i do
well, you drive me crazy half the time
the other half, i'm only tryin' to
let you know that what i feel is true
and i'm only me when i'm with you


just a small-town boy and girl
livin' in a crazy world
tryna figure out what is and isn't true
and i don't try to hide my tears
my secrets or my deepest fears
through it all, nobody gets me like you do


and you know everything about me
you say that you can't live without me


i'm only up when you're not down
don't wanna fly if you're still on the ground
it's like no matter what i do
well, you drive me crazy half the time
the other half, i'm only tryin' to
let you know that what i feel is true
and i'm only me when i'm with you


when i'm with anybody else
it's so hard to be myself
and only you can tell


that i'm only up when you're not down
don't wanna fly if you're still on the ground
it's like no matter what i do
well, you drive me crazy half the time
the other half, i'm only tryin' to
let you know that what i feel is true
and i'm only me
who i wanna be
well, i'm only me when i'm with you


with you
uh-huh-huh, yeah
