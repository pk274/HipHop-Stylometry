we were both young when i first saw you
i close my eyes and the flashback starts
we were both young when i first saw you
i close my eyes and the flashback starts


romeo, save me, i've been feeling so alone
i keep waiting for you, but you never come
is this in my head? i don't know what to think
he knelt to the ground and pulled out a ring
and said


romeo, save me, i've been feeling so alone
i keep waiting for you, but you never come
is this in my head? i don't know what to think
he knelt to the ground and pulled out a ring
and said

"marry me, juliet, you'll never have to be alone
i love you, and that's all i really know
i talked to your dad, go pick out a white dress
it's a love story, baby, just say yes"

oh, oh
oh, oh
'cause we were both young when i first saw you
