i was thinking 'bout her, thinking 'bout me
thinking 'bout us, what we gon' be
open my eyes
it was only just a dream
so i travelled back down that road
will she come back? no one knows
i realize it was only just a dream


my lover, my life, my shawty, my wife
she left me, i'm tied
'cause i knew that it just ain't right


i was thinking 'bout her, thinking 'bout me
thinking 'bout us, what we gon' be
open my eyes
it was only just a dream
so i travelled back down that road
will she come back? no one knows
i realize it was only just a dream


when i be ridin', man, i swear i see her face at every turn
tryna get my usher over i can't let it burn
and i just hope she know that she's the only one i yearn for
more and more i miss her. when will i learn?
didn't give her all my love, i guess now i got my payback
now i'm in the club thinking all about my baby
hey, she was so easy to love
but wait, i guess that love wasn't enough
i'm going through it every time that i'm alone
and now i'm missing, wishing she'd pick up the phone
but she made the decision that she wanted to move on
'cause i was wrong


i was thinking 'bout her, thinking 'bout me
thinking 'bout us, what we gon' be
open my eyes
it was only just a dream
so i travelled back down that road
will she come back? no one knows
i realize it was only just a dream


i was thinking 'bout her, thinking 'bout me
thinking 'bout us, what we gon' be
open my eyes
it was only just a dream
so i travelled back down that road
will she come back? no one knows
i realize it was only just a dream
