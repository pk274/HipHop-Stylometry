she didn't have a reason to go, oh no
she didn't have a reason to stay
either way she didn't tell anyone about her first ray of sun
she looked at her keys and found a reason to run


and time stands still when you're nowhere bound
but i understand it somehow


if i could drive all night would i find my peace of mind?
would it be a million miles of cold white lies
and unfamiliar exit signs?
i just drive on by, just south of knowing why


i didn't really know her that well
but i could tell that her smile was only something to hide behind
she felt so out of touch, because  she just felt too much
if you don't know what you want nothing's ever enough


and time stands still when you're nowhere bound
that's where i'm headed right now


if i could drive all night would i find my peace of mind?
would it be a million miles of cold white lies
and unfamiliar exit signs?
i just drive on by, just south of knowing why


i don't have a plan, i don't have a map
i don't even know if i'm ever going back
i don't have a when and i don't have a where
i don't even know if i'll know when i'm there


but if i could drive all night would i find my peace of mind?
would it be a million miles of cold white lies
and unfamiliar exit signs?
i just drive on by


i just drive on by, drive on, drive on
drive all night
if i drive on, drive on, drive on
drive all night, just south of knowing why
