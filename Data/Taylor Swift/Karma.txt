you're talking shit for the hell of it
addicted to betrayal, but you're relevant
you're terrified to look down
'cause if you dare, you'll see the glare
of everyone you burned just to get there
it's coming back around


and i keep my side of the street clean
you wouldn't know what i mean


'cause karma is my boyfriend
karma is a god
karma is the breeze in my hair on the weekend
karma's a relaxing thought
aren't you envious that for you it's not?
sweet like honey, karma is a cat
purring in my lap 'cause it loves me
flexing like a goddamn acrobat
me and karma vibe like that


spiderboy, king of thieves
weave your little webs of opacity
my pennies made your crown
trick me once, trick me twice
don't you know that cash ain't the only price?
it's coming back around


and i keep my side of the street clean
you wouldn't know what i mean


'cause karma is my boyfriend
karma is a god
karma is the breeze in my hair on the weekend
karma's a relaxing thought
aren't you envious that for you it's not?
sweet like honey, karma is a cat
purring in my lap 'cause it loves me
flexing like a goddamn acrobat
me and karma vibe like that


ask me what i learned from all those years
ask me what i earned from all those tears
ask me why so many fade, but i'm still here
(i'm still here, i'm still here)


'cause karma is my boyfriend (karma is my boyfriend)
karma is a god
karma is the breeze in my hair on the weekend (weekend)
karma's a relaxing thought
aren't you envious that for you it's not?
sweet like honey, karma is a cat
purring in my lap 'cause it loves me
flexing like a goddamn acrobat
me and karma vibe like that


karma is my boyfriend
karma is a god (ah)
uh-huh, mm
karma's a relaxing thought
