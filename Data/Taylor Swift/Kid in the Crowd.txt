little girl, she looks around
she's standing in the open ground
looks up at the girl alone singing through the microphone
girl gives girl a little smile
and just one wink that could have run a mile
but life is full of empty days
but the little girl said, "i'm gonna be like that someday"


i, i remember the eyes
of the kid in the crowd
who cut me down to size
and realizing is crying out loud
for every kid on stage
there is a kid in the crowd


girl on stage holds her hand
backed up by a country band
looking down with eyes of grace
looked upon that young girl's face
and when she smiled at that eight-year-old
endless thoughts that can never be told
wiped away those empty days
and the little girl said, "i'm gonna be like that someday"


i, i remember the eyes
of the kid in the crowd
who cut me down to size
and realizing is crying out loud
for every kid on stage
there is a kid in the crowd


answered "whys" are like moonlit skies
and lovin' eyes are like fireflies
wannabes, they really can be
but the little girl, that little girl was me


i, i remember the time
i was a kid in the crowd
with the dream in my eyes
realizing is crying out loud
there was a kid on stage
i was the kid in the crowd


oh, oh
i'm still the kid in the crowd
