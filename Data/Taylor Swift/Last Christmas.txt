last christmas i gave you my heart
but the very next day, you gave it away
this year, to save me from tears
i will give it to someone special


once bitten and twice shied
i keep my distance but you still catch my eye
tell me baby
do you recognize me
well, it has been a year, it does not surprise me
merry christmas, i wrapped it up and sent it
with a note saying 'i love you', i meant it
now i know what a fool i've been
but if you kiss me now, i know you would fool me again


last christmas i gave you my heart
but the very next day, you gave it away
this year, to save me from tears
i will give it to someone special
last christmas i gave you my heart
but the very next day, you gave it away
this year, to save me from tears
i will give it to someone special


a crowded room and friends with tired eyes
i am hiding from you and your soul of ice
my god, i thought you were someone to rely on
me, i guess i was a shoulder to cry on
a face on a lover with a fire in his heart
a girl on a cover but you tore her apart
maybe this year
maybe this year i will give it to someone special


because last christmas i gave you my heart
but the very next day, you gave it away
this year, to save me from tears
i will give it to someone special
last christmas i gave you my heart
but the very next day, you gave it away
this year, to save me from tears
i will give it to someone special

and last christmas
and this year
it won't be anything like, anything like

last christmas i gave you my heart
but the very next day, you gave it away
this year, to save me from tears
i will give it to someone special
