meet me at midnight


staring at the ceiling with you
oh, you don't ever say too much
and you don't really read into
my melancholia


i been under scrutiny (yeah, oh, yeah)
you handle it beautifully (yeah, oh, yeah)
all this shit is new to me (yeah, oh, yeah)


i feel the lavender haze creeping up on me
surreal
i'm damned if i do give a damn what people say
no deal
the 1950s shit they want from me
i just wanna stay in that lavender haze


all they keep asking me (all they keep asking me)
is if i'm gonna be your bride
thе only kinda girl they see (only kinda girl they see)
is a one-night or a wifе


i find it dizzying (yeah, oh, yeah)
they're bringing up my history (yeah, oh, yeah)
but you weren't even listening (yeah, oh, yeah)


i feel the lavender haze creepin' up on me
surreal
i'm damned if i do give a damn what people say
no deal
the 1950s shit they want from me
i just wanna stay in that lavender—
