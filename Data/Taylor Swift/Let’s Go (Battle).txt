the first shot's fired, everybody's gathered around
you're looking at me like i tried to take you down
no, no, that's not what happened at all
there's no sound, i'm waiting on your next move
a showdown and i know where to hit you
but no, no, it's not how i wanted this to go down


now we're standing in the ring
and you make the first swing
and now we're fighting dirty
won't somebody come say, "break it up"?

and i used to be on your side
now it's looking like we're going to battle
and why you taking shots at me like
somebody's gonna give you a medal?
and i never wanna hurt you
but i'm tired of taking all these blows
and so i'd rather be on your side
but if you wanna fight
baby, let's go, oh, oh
let's go, oh, oh


so gloves off, if this is how you want it
we had it all, but you couldn't keep a promise
no, no, i'm not the one who tore us apart
let me remind you for a minute why we're not fine
is she here? is she standing on the sidelines?
oh, oh, can't you tell this is breaking my heart?


now we're standing in the ring
and you make the first swing
and now i'm fighting dirty
but i ain't going down â€˜til they break it up


and i used to be on your side
now it's looking like we're going to battle
and why you taking shots at me like
somebody's gonna give you a medal?
and i never wanna hurt you
but i'm tired of taking all these blows
and so i'd rather be on your side
but if you wanna fight
let's go, oh, oh
let's go, oh, oh


now we're standing in the ring
breaking everything that we've been building up so long
and i don't wanna do this, break it up
but you're not who i thought you were
and this is looking more like a war
looks like we're going to war


and i used to be on your side
now it's looking like we're going to battle
and i'm trying not to break down crying
no one's gonna give you a medal
and i never wanna hurt you
but i'm tired of taking all these blows
and so i'd rather be on your side
i'd rather be on your side
but if you wanna fight
baby, let's go, oh, oh
looks like we're going to war
oh, oh


the first shot's fired, everybody's gathered around
you're looking at me like i tried to take you down
no, no, but if you wanna fight, baby, let's go
