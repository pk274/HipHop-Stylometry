i love my hometown as much as motown, i love socal
and you know i love springsteen, faded blue jeans, tennessee whiskey
but somethin' happened, i heard him laughin'
i saw the dimples first and then i heard the accent


they say, "home is where the heart is"
but that's not where mine lives


you know i love a london boy
i enjoy walkin' camden market in the afternoon
he likes my american smile, like a child when our eyes meet
darling, i fancy you
took me back to highgate, met all of his best mates
so i guess all the rumors are true
you know i love a london boy
boy, i fancy you (ooh)


and now i love high tea, stories from uni' and the west end
you can find me in the pub, we are watchin' rugby with his school friends
show me a gray sky, a rainy cab ride
babes, don't threaten me with a good time


they say, "home is where the heart is"
but, god, i love the english


you know i love a london boy
i enjoy nights in brixton, shoreditch in the afternoon
he likes my american smile, like a child when our eyes meet
darling, i fancy you
took me back to highgate, met all of his best mates
so i guess all the rumors are true
you know i love a london boy
boy, i fancy you


so please show me hackney
doesn't have to be louis v up on bond street
just wanna be with you

stick with me, i'm your queen
like a tennessee stella mccartney on the heath
just wanna be with you (wanna be with you)
wanna be with you, oh, woah
