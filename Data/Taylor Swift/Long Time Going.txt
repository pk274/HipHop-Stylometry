i got a lying smile i never put out for you
'cause i guess i never felt like i really needed to
and they say little girls have big dreams
and nothing in the world was gonna come between me and you


and it was a long time coming
i waited half my life just to find someone like you
i spent a long time finding out love hangs around after you walk out
not knowing it'd be a long time going


they say it's better to have lost than never to have loved at all
and i say, whoever said that didn't have too far to fall
and they say little girls are so naive
that wasn't how it was supposed to be with me and you


and it was a long time coming
i waited half my life just to find someone like you
i spend a long time finding out love hangs around after you walk out
not knowing it will be a long time going


i've burned my bridges, had sleepless nights
washed my sins on the neon lights
and i'm still not over you


and it was a long time coming
i waited half my life just to find someone like you
i spend a long time finding out love hangs around after you walk out
not knowing it will be a long time going


a long time going
and it will be a long time, long time going
oh-oh, oh-oh, oh
it will be a long time, long time going, going
oh-oh, oh-oh, oh
