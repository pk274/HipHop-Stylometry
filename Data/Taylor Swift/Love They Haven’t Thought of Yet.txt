i want it all to appear before my eyes when he smiles
maybe i'm wrong but i don't think romeo would be my kind of guy
i want a love that's sweeter than roses
and for me this is how it's gonna be


like there's a fairytale guy
and he whispers sweet lullabies
and the music plays from nowhere
as we dance in the pale moonlight
with candles and fireflies all night
everybody thinks about love
i want love they haven't thought of yet


here on the couch with a box of chocolates that i bought myself
i'll wait it out but sometimes my patience just needs a little help
it's what you get when your heartstrings are so tied
i don't regret it 'cause it needs to be perfect


like there's a fairytale guy
and he whispers sweet lullabies
and he music plays from nowhere
as we dance in the pale moonlight
with candles and fireflies all night
everybody thinks about love
i want love they haven't thought of yet

i want my own little storybook ending
we'll make it up as we go


there's a fairytale guy
and he whispers sweet lullabies
and the music plays from nowhere
as we dance in the pale moonlight
with candles and fireflies all night
everybody thinks about love
i want love they haven't thought of yet
i want love they haven't thought of yet
