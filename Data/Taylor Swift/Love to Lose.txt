come on, gather 'round, i'm gonna tell you how the fire went out
sorry for the inconvenience, i didn't mean to let you down
we were supposed to be forever but it's too bad you didn't see that to me
you were the perfect view of misery


i never talked about the tears i cried
all the sleepless nights or the endless fights
i never talked about the days he called
there was something wrong, it was all my fault
i had it all, what a shame, what a fall now
but in case you haven't heard the news
there wasn't much love to lose


let's talk about that golden boy that i met on a winter night
how was i supposed to know that he was just as cold inside?
he smiled and i smiled, well the camera's in your mind
and i lied, i swore that everything was fine


i never talked about the tears i cried
all the sleepless nights or the endless fights
i never talked about the nights he called
there was something wrong, it was all my fault
i had it all, what a shame, what a fall now
but in case you haven't heard the news
there wasn't much love to lose


i know you wanna talk about me
how i gave up on love so foolishly
but keep in mind


i never talked about the tears i cried
all the sleepless nights or the endless fights
i never talked about the nights he called
there was something wrong, it was all my fault
i had it all, what a shame, what a fall now
but in case you haven't heard the news
there wasn't much love to lose


come on, gather 'round, i'm gonna tell you how the fire went out
