there's a little girl in this little town
with a little too much heart to go around
live forever, never say never
you could do better, that's what she says


mama named her lucky on a starlit night
a rabbit foot in her pocket, she dances in spite
of the fact that she's different
and yet she's the same
and she says, "do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do
do-do-do-do-do-do-do, do-do-do-do
do-do-do, do-do-do, do-do-do-do
lucky you, lucky you"


she sings her little song, she walks along
a little pathway headed for the skies
left to travеls, lives they unravel
mind ovеr matter, that's what she says


mama named her lucky on a starlit night
a rabbit foot in her pocket, she dances in spite
of the fact that she's different
and yet she's the same
and she says, "do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do
do-do-do-do-do-do-do, do-do-do-do
do-do-do, do-do-do, do-do-do-do
lucky you, lucky you, lucky you"


maybe she'll sing you do-do-do-do
maybe she'll bring you into the skies
honey, she'll love you, funny how some view
angels above you aren't so far away


mama named her lucky on a starlit night
a rabbit foot in her pocket, she dances in spite
of the fact that she's different
and yet she's the same
and she says, "lucky you, lucky you"
