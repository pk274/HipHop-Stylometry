macavity's a mystery cat, he's called the hiddenpaw
for he's the master criminal who can defy the law
he's the bafflement of scotland yard, the flying squad's despair
for when they reach the scene of crime, macavity's not there


macavity, macavity, there's no one like macavity
he's broken every human law, he breaks the law of gravity
his powers of levitation would make a fakir stare
but when they reach the scene of crime, macavity's not there


macavity's a ginger cat, he's very tall and thin
you would know him if you saw him for his eyes are sunken in
his brow is deeply lined with thought, his head is highly domed
his coat is dusty from neglect, his whiskers are uncombed
he sways his head from side to side, with movements like a snake
and when you think he's half asleep, he's always wide awake


macavity, macavity, there's no one like macavity
for he's a fiend in feline shape, a monster of depravity
you may meet him in a by-street, you may see him in the square
but when a crime's discovered, then macavity's not there


he's outwardly respectable, i know, he cheats at cards
and his footprints are not found in any files of scotland yard's
and when the larder's looted and the jewel case is rifled
or when the milk is missing or another peke's been stifled
or the greenhouse glass is broken and the trellis past repair
there's the wonder of the thing, macavity's not there


macavity, macavity, there's no one like macavity
there never was a cat of such deceitfulness and suavity
he always has an alibi, and one or two to spare
what ever time the deed took place, macavity wasn't there
and they say that all the cats whose wicked deeds are widely known
i might mention mungojerrie, rumpleteazer, griddlebone
are nothing more than agents for the cat who all the time
just controls the operations, the napoleon of crime
macavity, macavity, there's no one like macavity
he's a fiend in feline shape, a monster of depravity
you may meet him in a by-street, you may see him in the square
but when a crime's discovered, then macavity, macavity
macavity, macavity


when a crime's discovered, then
macavity's not there
