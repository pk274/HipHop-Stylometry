your feet under the table
i love it when they're touching mine
your hands make the crisps at the cradle
to tell me everything is fine
all i see is you looking at me


do you know when you go
you make the sweetest sight at the window
if you had never come out of the blue
i would have stayed up and made up you


you smile just like a picture
it doesn't even need a frame
sometimes i wait to answer
just to hear you say my name
and all i want is just what i've got


do you know when you go
you make the sweetest sight at the window
if you had never come out of the blue
i would have stayed up and made up you


i'd never let you go
even if i could
cause i never could've dreamed you up this good


do you know when you go
you make the sweetest sight at the window
if you had never come out of the blue
i would have stayed up and made up you


made up you
oh oh
made up you
