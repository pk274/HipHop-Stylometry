there's a little green house off a gravel road
’bout a mile from bobby freeman's farm
mary jo runs her own little flower shop
courtesy of the old red barn
my mama's mama’s lifelong friend, jo
didn't like the people of town
four kids and wildflowers and calla lilies
jo'd rather have them around


got me a letter, said
"you gotta come home
i'm feeling a little bit low
it's lilac season and i need some help
keeping my garden grown
signed, mary jo"


so many questions answered
when i spent that summer with jo
lavender pillows and weeping willows
things i would never have known
'til mary jo


we collected bouquets and made lemonade
mixed rose water perfume
jo started giving and i started living
under the pale blue moon
sang to jo's records and sweet home kentucky
watching her garden grow
says i'm smart and always was lucky
now i’ll never really know
xo, mary jo

summer started packing its bags
and mary jo had something on her mind
cleared her throat and swallowed real hard
and said "my voice seems to be in a bind
but when i wrote that letter i was really sick
the doctor said i was gonna go
then you came home and it seems to be gone
you made something in that garden grow
but we'll never know"
