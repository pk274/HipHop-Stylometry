me and britney used to sit on the front porch drinking lemonade
talking 'bout things no one else was ever supposed to hear
in the summer shade
she said she was gonna be a movie star
and i said she was crazy
catching dreams and fireflies in a jar
just me and britney


oh, oh
we were babies, we were beautiful and free
oh, oh
there was nothing that was out of reach
for me and britney


she never made it to hollywood but she made it to memphis
and this little old town just hasn’t been the same since
that boy she ran off with, well, i thought he was crazy
maybe i was just jealous that he'd come between me and britney


oh, oh
she was in love, she was beautiful and free
oh, oh
she was always so much braver than me


when the phone rang in the middle of the night
before she said a word i knew it was her
she said i’m sorry for waking you up but i didn’t know who else to call
or where else to go


me and britney sat down on the front porch
talking about love and how it changes things
changes people and it changes names and everything but me and britney


oh, oh
we’re not as young, but we’re still beautiful and free
oh, oh
even when we’re old, we’re still going to be


me and britney sitting on the front porch drinking lemonade
talking about things no one else is ever gonna hear
in the summer shade
