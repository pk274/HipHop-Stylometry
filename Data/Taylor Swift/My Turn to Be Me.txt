something about me didn't fit into your perfect world
i bet the bluegrass stained your smile
you should use a darker color when you write on the wall
i haven't read it a thousand times


maybe if you saw me for a second you would realize
honey i was trying so hard


to talk, walk, think, stop
anytime you want me to
bend all my rules
i used to let you choose
who you wanted me to be
this time i'm flying free
it's my turn to be me


you liked the face but you had to replace me
inside i saw the walls of me go down
you can take the girl away from
cowboy hats and steel guitars
she'll still sing the same old songs


maybe if you saw me for a second you would realize
honey i was trying so hard


to talk, walk, think, stop
anytime you want me to
bend all my rules
i used to let you choose
who you wanted me to be
this time i'm flying free
it's my turn to be me


turned on that radio
hey that's when i realized
it wasn't our song, it was yours
and in conversation baby i was decoration
now i deserve a little bit more than


to talk, walk, think, stop
anytime you want me to
bend all my rules
i used to let you choose
who you wanted me to be
this time i'm flying free
it's my turn to be me
