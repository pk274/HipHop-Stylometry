"i need you now"
read letters that i wrote on the wall
and the message that i left when i called
i need you now
words i said drowned out by the rain
waiting there for you, but you never came
my world's a little colder now
but i'm keeping warm somehow


so here you are at my window
guess nobody told you
i don't need you, don't need you
and i waited, so frustrated
who's gonna hold you?
i don't need you, don't need you now


"i need you now"
words i heard you whisper to me
when we were walking down a one-way street
and you need me now
that's what you've been telling my friends
but i've come too far to go back there again
my heart, my mind, and numbers have changed
you might as well forget my name


so here you are at my window
guess nobody told you
i don't need you, don't need you
and i waited, so frustrated
who's gonna hold you?
i don't need you, don't need you now


"i need you now"
read letters that i wrote on the wall
and the message that i left when i called


so here you are at my window
guess nobody told you
i don't need you, don't need you
and i waited, so frustrated
so who's gonna hold you?
i don't need you now


don't need you
i don't need you now
