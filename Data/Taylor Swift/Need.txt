want is the cigarette smoke on a jacket
you wore to the wrong part of town
desire is the sound of the whiskey
telling me you miss me, can you come around?


passion is a passing thing
it's accidental chemistry
lust is a liar, a short-lived fire
it ain't what you and i are at all


oh, it's a need, it's a need
i would go anywhere that you lead
i am hopeless, breathless, burning slow
touch me, hold me, tell me, "i won't let you go"
i won't leave, it's a need


danger is a thousand prickles on my neck
that tell me to run or to freeze
fear is the nightmare i had, you were with someone else
you forgot about me


passion is a passing thing
it's accidental chemistry
caught up in a feeling, it can be deceiving
this is like breathing for me


oh, it's a need, it's a need
i would go anywhere that you lead
i am hopeless, breathless, burning slow
touch me, hold me, tell me, "i won't let you go"
i won't leave, it's a need


baby, it's always a new kiss every time we do this
the truth is it's essential to me
that you love me more than wishing, longing


oh, it's a need (it's a need), it's a need (ah-ah, ah-ah)
i would go (i would go) anywhere (anywhere) that you lead (oh, oh)
i am hopeless, breathless, burning slow (burning slow)
touch me, hold me, tell me, "i won't let you go"
i won't leave (i won't leave), it's a need (oh)
