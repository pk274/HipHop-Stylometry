i think you fell off of your cloud today
you didn't see it coming or did you
you tried to please everybody
but the sweet breeze swept you away


the sun goes down on a good day
tomorrow is still an unknown
you think you're all alone in this place
i think you're crazy 'cause i still love you baby


oh don't fade away baby
blowing in the wind is getting harder to do
don't count the days as they leave you
count them as you find a day new
don't fade away
never fade


hard to breathe, nobody knows it's you
somebody blows your candle out
you wore a mask, now that's broken too
everybody else was everything to you


the sun goes down on a good day
tomorrow is still an unknown
you think everybody wants a fight
i think you're crazy 'cause i still love you baby


oh don't fade away baby
blowing in the wind is getting harder to do
don't count the days as they leave you
count them as you find a day new
don't fade away
never fade


i think you fell out of the sky today
i think you know it's true
you've seen the world, now all you see is me
tell me now baby what are you gonna do


oh don't fade away baby
blowing in the wind is getting harder to do
don't count the days as they leave you
count them as you find a day new
don't fade away
don't fade away
don't fade away
never fade
