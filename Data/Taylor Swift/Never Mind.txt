look at you, look at me
look at who we could be
i want to know who you are
what you want from the stars
and every time i look at you, i can hardly say a thing
my head starts to spin, and it hits me then
i love you
and every time you look at me, i could go crazy, but i don't
say it, but i won't
'cause i'd rather be alone than lose you


and all i really want to do is be next to you
but i'm too tired to fight
and i could tell you now
but baby, never mind


all the time, everyday
there's nothing i can do, baby, to make it go away
so look at you, and look at me
and think of who we could be
but every time i look at you, i can hardly say a thing
my head starts to spin, and it hits me then
i love you
and every time you look at me, i could go crazy, but i don't
say it, but i won't
'cause i'd rather be alone than lose you


and all i really want to do is be next to you
but i'm too tired to fight
and i could tell you now
but baby, never mind


all i really want to say is i need you, babe
but how could you understand?
what happens if you turn away
and everything turns blue and gray?
and i just wish i told you, never mind
and i could tell you now, but baby, never mind


yeah, oh yeah
i could tell you now, but never mind
yeah, oh yeah, yeah
and i could tell you now, but never mind
