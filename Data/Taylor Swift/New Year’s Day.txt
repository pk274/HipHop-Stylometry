there's glitter on the floor after the party
girls carryin’ their shoes down in the lobby
candle wax and polaroids on the hardwood floor
you and me from the night before, but


don't read the last page
but i stay when you're lost and i’m scared and you're turnin' away
i want your midnights
but i'll be cleanin' up bottles with you on new year's day


you squeeze my hand three times in the back of the taxi
i can tell that it's gonna be a long road
i'll be there if you’re the toast of the town, babe
or if you strike out and you’re crawlin' home


don’t read the last page
but i stay when it's hard or it's wrong or we're makin’ mistakes
i want your midnights
but i'll be cleanin' up bottles with you on new year's day


please, don't ever become a stranger
whose laugh i could recognize anywhere
please, don't ever become a stranger
whose laugh i could recognize anywhere


there's glitter on the floor after the party
girls carryin' their shoes down in the lobby
candle wax and polaroids on the hardwood floor
you and me forevermore


don't read the last page
but i stay when it's hard or it's wrong or we're makin' mistakes
i want your midnights
but i'll be cleanin' up bottles with you on new year's day


please, don't ever become a stranger
(to the memories, they will hold on to you)
whose laugh i could recognize anywhere
(hold on to the memories, they will hold on to you)
please, don't ever become a stranger
(hold on to the memories, they will hold on to you)
whose laugh i could recognize anywhere
(and i will hold on to you)
