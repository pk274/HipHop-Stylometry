standing on the border
looking out into the great unknown
i can feel my heart beating faster as i step out on my own
there's a new horizon and the promise of favorable wind
i'm heading out tonight, traveling light
i'm gonna start all over again


and buy a one-way ticket on a westbound train
see how far i can go
'cause i'm gonna go out dancing in the pouring rain
and talk to someone i don't know
i will face the world around me
knowing that i'm strong enough to let you go
i will fall in love again
because i can


gonna climb the mountain
and look the eagle in the eye
and i won't let fear clip my wings and tell me how high i can fly
how could i have ever believed
that love had to be so blind
when freedom was waiting, down at the station
all i had to do was make up my mind


and buy a one-way ticket on a westbound train
see how far i can go
'cause i'm gonna go out dancing in the pouring rain
and talk to someone i don't know
i will face the world around me
knowing that i'm strong enough to let you go
i will fall in love again
because i can


well, i have walked through the fire
and crawled on my knees through the valley of the shadow of doubt
then the truth came shining like a light on me
and now i can see my way out


buy a one-way ticket on a westbound train
see how far i can go
'cause i'm gonna go out dancing in the pouring rain
and talk to someone i don't know
buy a one-way ticket on a westbound train
i'm gonna have my breakfast with some pink champagne
gonna sail the ocean, gonna spread my wings
gonna climb that mountain, gonna do everything
everything
