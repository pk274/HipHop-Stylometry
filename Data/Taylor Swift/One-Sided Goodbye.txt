you said it, then you walked away
but you don't know what goodbye means
baby, i'm sorry, didn't ever mean to hurt you
please, save it for a rainy day
'cause you don't know what crying's like
when the world keeps spinning and i can't take it alone


and you're so different from all those other people
i thought it would be different with you
but i can't see you crying without me
so i guess i'll have to make it through without you


i wasn't ready for your one-sided goodbye
you walked around like you loved me, i
notice how the world tries to mask that word
"see you later," "gotta go," oh no


i don't care what they would say
if you love someone don't let them go
do you believe in taking chances?
so tell me why you walked away
'cause i can't see through your heart
everything's hazy and you're making me crazy for you


well, i thought you were different
maybe i'm crazy
i know i wasn't numb with you
but i can't hear you crying without me
so i guess i'll have to make it through without you


i wasn't ready for your one-sided goodbye
you walked around like you loved me, i
notice how the world tries to mask that word
"see you later," "gotta go"


why can't you see, why can't you be
madly in love with me, too?
past emotion, but you've already spoken
i guess i'll have to make it through without you


i wasn't ready for your one-sided goodbye
you walked around like you loved me, i
notice how the world tries to mask that word
"see you later," "gotta go", oh no
