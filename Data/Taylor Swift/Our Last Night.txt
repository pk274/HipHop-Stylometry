oh
we were standing in an empty room
the moonlight was falling
you were holding my hand when the car pulled up for you
and i could have spent a life with you
but those days are over
you were calling my name
when your face faded from view


wasn't it you that told me?
the sun would always chase the day
wasn't it you that told me?


angels fly, in the air tonight
saying wasn't it just like swimming out on the lake?
stars collide in the air so light
or was it just like those promises that you made? on our last night


oh
i remember waking up with you
the days doing nothing
you meant more to me then, than you ever knew
you were going to be a doctor, a movie star, poet at a nobel seminar
hope the the world never tore that out of you


tell me whatever happened to the things you loved?
and the songs we played and the indian days
whatever happened to the things you gave away?
like harold and martin singing
i was waving as you drove away
the sunlight was falling
you were riding backwards in a dusty window pane


angels fly in the air tonight
was it just like the promises that we made?
and stars collide in the air so light
was it just like those promises that you made?
on our last night
on our last night
oh, oh, oh, whoa, whoa, yeah, oh
