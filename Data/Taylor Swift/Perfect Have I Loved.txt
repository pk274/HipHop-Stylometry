if you love me then i love you, swear by the freckles on the moon
and maybe this will be enough
i'd like to keep you til i'm old, but if i can't, at least you'll know
that, baby, perfect have i loved


do you remember the stupid things we used to do?
before september stole me away from you?
the time we got your truck stuck in the creek?
'cause, baby, roads weren't wild enough for you and me, sayin'


if you love me then i love you, swear by the freckles on the moon
and maybe this will be enough
i'd like to keep you til i'm old, but if i can't, at least you'll know
that, baby, perfect have i loved


i used to see you by the bridge we used to cross
i found the feeling of trying to get lost
you would smile that smile that i tried so hard to forget
it's hard to douse a fire that i still haven't put out yet


and if you love me then i love you, swear by the freckles on the moon
and maybe this will be enough
i'd like to keep you til i'm old, but if i can't, at least you'll know
that, baby, perfect have i loved


love was all we knew, and faith was growing on the vines
words were all we had, and for one summer, you were mine
sayin'


if you love me then i love you, swear by the freckles on the moon
and maybe this will be enough
i'd like to keep you til i'm old, but if i can't, at least i'll know
that, baby, perfect have i loved
