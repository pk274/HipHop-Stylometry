i could have keyed your car
i could have rolled your yard
i know the passwords to your emails and everything you do
i could have put them to good use
but i'm dressed to kill
and tonight i am going out on a date
with your best friend
he always liked me anyway


r.e.v.e.n.g.e
my list of things to do this week
jealousy, misery
gon' give you what you gave to me
make you feel so b.a.d
break you, make you sorry
i hope you cry, i'm getting my
r.e.v.e.n.g.e


so i'm gonna paint the town with him
replace your memory everywhere we've ever been
i don't hang-out at smokey bars, but i know we'll see you there
and i'll make you hear me laughing, like i just don't care
i know you hate my friends, so tonight i called them all
and later on you can expect some prank phone calls, baby!


r.e.v.e.n.g.e
my list of things to do this week
jealousy, misery
gon' give you what you gave to me

you've made me crazy too long
and so i'm working on


r.e.v.e.n.g.e
my list of things to do this week
jealousy, misery
gon' give you what you gave to me
