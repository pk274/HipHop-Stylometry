i remember tears streaming down your face when i said, "i'll never let you go"
when all those shadows almost killed your light
i remember you said, "don't leave me here alone"
but all that's dead and gone and passed tonight


just close your eyes
the sun is going down
you'll be alright
no one can hurt you now
come morning light
you and i'll be safe and sound


don't you dare look out your window
darling, everything's on fire
the war outside our door keeps raging on
hold on to this lullaby
even when (the) music's gone
gone


just close your eyes
the sun is going down
you'll be alright
no one can hurt you now
come morning light
you and i'll be safe and sound


ooh, ooh
ooh, ooh
oh (oh)
oh (oh)
ooh, ooh
ooh, ooh
oh
oh


just close your eyes
you'll be alright
come morning light
you and i'll be safe and sound


ooh, ooh
ooh, ooh
ooh, ooh
ooh, ooh
ooh, ooh
ooh, ooh
