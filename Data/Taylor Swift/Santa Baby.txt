santa baby, slip a sable under the tree, for me
i have been an awful good girl, santa baby
so hurry down the chimney tonight
santa baby, a '54 convertible, too, light blue
well i will wait up for you, dear, santa baby
so hurry down the chimney tonight, yeah


think of all the fun i have missed
think of all the boys i have not kissed
next year i could be just as good
if you check off my christmas list


santa baby, i want a yacht and really that's not a lot
i have been an angel all year, santa baby
so hurry down the chimney tonight
santa, honey, there is one more thing i really do need, the deed
to a platinum mine, santa honey
so hurry down the chimney tonight


come and trim my christmas tree
with some decorations bought at tiffany's
i really do believe in you
let us see if you believe in me


santa baby, forgot to mention one little thing
a ring
and i don't mean on the phone, santa baby
so hurry down the chimney tonight
