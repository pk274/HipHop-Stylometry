do you remember
the 28th night of september?
love was changin' the minds of pretenders
while chasin' the clouds away
our hearts were ringin'
in the key that our souls were singin'
as we danced in the night, remember
how the stars stole the night away


ahh-ahh-ahh
hey, say that you remember
ai, ai, dancin' in september
ai, ai, never was a cloudy day


my thoughts are with you
holding hands with your heart to see you
only blue talk and love
remember how we knew love was here to stay
now, december found the love that we shared in september
only blue talk and love
remember the love that we share today


ahh-ahh-ahh
hey, say that you remember
ai, ai, dancin' in september
ai, ai, never was a cloudy day
ahh-ahh-ahh
hey, say that you remember
ai, ai, dancin' in september
ai, ai, golden dreams were shiny days


do you remember
the 28th night of september?


ahh-ahh-ahh
hey, say that you remember
ai, ai, dancin' in september
ai, ai, never was a cloudy day
ahh-ahh-ahh
hey, say that you remember
ai, ai, dancin' in september
ai, ai, golden dreams were shiny days
and there never was a cloudy day
there never was a cloudy day
