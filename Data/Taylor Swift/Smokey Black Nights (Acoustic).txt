let's watch the tide chase the waves onto the sand
i wonder if a broken heart can feel the warmth of my hand
and i wonder what a piece of driftwood has seen all through his lifetime
let's walk away the past through the smokey black nights


i've seen a million things
spoke a million words
now i only want to speak to you
waiting for the words
counting every bird
there's nothing i'd rather do
on the smokey black nights


still through the haze i can make out constellations
i'll make one of you and me as we sit in the sand
and i saw that sunset gleaming as my еyes went wild
let's walk away thе past through the smokey black nights


i've played a thousand songs
sang a thousand words
now i only want to sing to you
waited on a wire
staring at the fire
there's nothing i'd rather do
on the smokey black nights


i've walked a thousand miles
smiled a thousand smiles
now i only smile when i'm with you
waiting for the words
counting every bird
there's nothing i'd rather do
on the smokey black nights


so walk with me as the sweet wind dances
i'll write a song for you and me on the smokey black nights
