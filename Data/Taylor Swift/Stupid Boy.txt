let me know, how's it feel
to be under my skin, wrapped around my heart
is it like anywhere you've been?
and everything i do, i do it just for you


so why the hell don't you love me?
why the hell don't you need me like i need you?
why you so far above me?
don't you know that there's nothing i wouldn't do?
but i was just a toy, which you destroyed
stupid boy


i have been looking in, trying to read your mind
give you the benefit of the doubt, every single time
and then you walk right by, i'm screaming out inside


why the hell don't you love me?
why the hell don't you need me like i need you?
why you so far above me?
don't you know that there's nothing i wouldn't do?
but i was just a toy, which you destroyed
stupid boy


what happens when you wake up, to see that you've lost?
you take one look at me, cause that's what it cost
i just wanna be everything you need
cause you're everything to me


so why the hell don't you love me?
why the hell don't you need me like i need you?
why you so far above me?
don't you know that there's nothing i wouldn't do?
but i was just a toy, which you destroyed
stupid boy


let me know, how's it feel to be under my skin
