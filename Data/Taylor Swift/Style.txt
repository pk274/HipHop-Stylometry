midnight
you come and pick me up, no headlights
a long drive
could end in burning flames or paradise
fade into view, oh
it's been a while since i have even heard from you
(heard from you)


and i should just tell you to leave, 'cause i
know exactly where it leads, but i
watch us go 'round and 'round each time


you got that james dean daydream look in your eye
and i got that red lip classic thing that you like
and when we go crashing down, we come back every time
'cause we never go out of style, we never go out of style
you got that long hair, slicked back, white t-shirt
and i got that good girl faith and a tight little skirt
and when we go crashing down, we come back every time
'cause we never go out of style, we never go out of style


so it goes
he can't keep his wild eyes on the road, mmm
takes me home
the lights are off, he's taking off his coat, mmm, yeah
i say, "i heard, oh
that you've been out and about with some other girl"
some other girl


he says, "what you heard is true, but i
can't stop thinking 'bout you and i"
i said, "i've been there too a few times"


'cause you got that james dean daydream look in your eye
and i got that red lip classic thing that you like
and when we go crashing down, we come back every time
'cause we never go out of style, we never go out of style
you got that long hair, slicked back, white t-shirt
and i got that good girl faith and a tight little skirt (a tight little skirt)
and when we go crashing down, we come back every time
'cause we never go out of style (we never go, we never go), we never go out of style


take me home (ah)
just take me home (ah)
yeah, just take me home (ah)
oh-oh, woah-oh, oh (out of style)


oh, you got that james dean daydream look in your eye
and i got that red lip classic thing that you like
and when we go crashing down (and when we go), we come back every time
'cause we never go out of style, we never go out of style
