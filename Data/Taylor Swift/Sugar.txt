what a thing to see
what a thing to be
what a perfect love, what a perfect home
'cause every time she walks
and every time she talks
is every time he knows what a perfect world he's living on


but whenever he's gone and when she's all alone
his heart goes out to her on the telephone


and he says, "sugar, how i love you
how i think about you all the time"
he calls her "sugar" 'cause she's the sweetest thing
oh, she's the best thing he'll ever find


with her midnight hair
and with his favorite stare
she's a southern belle, he's a rockout king
when she looks around
oh, she knows she's found
such a perfect life, such a perfect thing


and whenever he's gone and when she's all alone
his heart goes out to her on the telephone


and he says, "sugar, how i love you
how i think about you all the time"
he calls her "sugar" 'cause she's the sweetest thing
oh, she's the best thing he'll ever find


oh, there's a reason for every season
there's a change within the range of every heart
but the reason and the season
seem to be right so far


and he says, "sugar, how i love you
how i think about you all the time"
he calls her "sugar" 'cause she's the sweetest thing
oh, she's the best thing he'll ever find
he calls her "sugar"
