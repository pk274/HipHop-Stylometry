tire swings, summer dreams, honeysuckle on the breeze
wilson county creek
laying in the green grass, i was watching clouds pass
baby, you were watching me
cold barns, truck beds, everything you said
slowly educating me
i never had a lesson so sweet


you can get high on a first kiss
you can get by with sweet tea and god's graces
you can love like a sinner and lose like a winner
nothing's shatterproof
you can crash and burn and come back someone new
and that's what i learned from you


autumn rain, window pane, looking how the leaves change
just like the two of us
still got your laugh, your ghost, your jacket
guess i loved you way too much
but i'm a little smarter, my heart's a little harder
but it's still soft enough to cry
cause i remember those times
i remember


you can get high on a first kiss
you can get by with sweet tea and god's graces
you can love like a sinner and lose like a winner
nothing's shatterproof
you can crash and burn and come back someone new
and that's what i learned from you


saw you just the other day
all that i could think to say was
"hey, how have you been?"
you caught me with that old smile
said, "it's really been a while
and i still think about back when"


we used to get high on the first kiss
we could get by with sweet tea and jesus
and you can love like a sinner and lose like a winner
nothing's shatterproof
you can crash and burn and now i'm someone new
and that's what i learned from you


oh, that's what i learned from you
that's what i learned from you, oh you, oh
that's what i learned from you, oh yeah
