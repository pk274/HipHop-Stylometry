drew looks at me
i fake a smile so he won't see
that i want and i'm needing
everything that we should be


i'll bet she's beautiful
that girl he talks about
and she's got everything that i have to live without


drew talks to me
i laugh 'cause it's just so funny
that i can't even see
anyone when he's with me


he says he's so in love
he's finally got it right
i wonder if he knows he's all i think about at night


he's the reason for the teardrops on my guitar
the only thing that keeps me wishing on a wishing star
he's the song in the car i keep singing
don't know why i do


drew walks by me
can he tell that i can't breathe?
and there he goes, so perfectly
the kind of flawless i wish i could be


she'd better hold him tight
give him all her love
look in those beautiful eyes and know she's lucky 'cause


he's the reason for the teardrops on my guitar
the only thing that keeps me wishing on a wishing star
he's the song in the car i keep singing
don't know why i do


so i drive home alone
as i turn off the light
i'll put his picture down and maybe get some sleep tonight


'cause he's the reason for the teardrops on my guitar
the only one who’s got enough for me to break my heart
he's the song in the car i keep singing
don't know why i do
he's the time taken up, but there's never enough
and he's all that i need to fall into


drew looks at me
i fake a smile so he won't see
