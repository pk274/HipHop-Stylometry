you look at me
i fake a smile so you won't see
that i want and i'm needing
everything that we should be


i'll bet she's beautiful, that girl ya talk about
and she's got everything that i have to live without


you talk to me
i laugh 'cause it's so damn funny
but i can't even see
anyone when you're with me


you say you're so in love, you finally got it right
i wonder if you know you're all i think about at night


you're the reason for the teardrops on my guitar
the only thing that keeps me wishing on a wishing star
you're the song in the car
i keep singing, don't know why i do...


you walk by me
can't you tell that i can't breathe?
and there you go, so perfectly
the kind of flawless i wish i could be


she'd better hold ya tight, give you all her love
look in those beautiful eyes and know she's lucky cause


you're the reason for the teardrops on my guitar
the only thing that keeps me wishing on a wishing star
you're the song in the car
i keep singing, don't know why i do...


you're the reason for the teardrops on my guitar
the only one whoâ€™s got enough of me to break my heart
you're the song in the car
i keep singing, don't know why i do...


you're the time taken up, but there's never enough
and you're all that i need to fall into
you look at me
i fake a smile so you won't see
