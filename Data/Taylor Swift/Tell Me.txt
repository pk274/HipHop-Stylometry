it was something like a perfect start to this love yesterday
but now who are you?
i thought i knew
your eyes happen now to look right through me
itâ€™s like you forgot the words you whispered to me
they weren't true
it's like it wasn't you


could you tell me what did i do?
because it can't be we're already through
did you sell me out for a fool after you held me?
was that just what you do?
what did you need from me?
tell me


take time to realize
i know that people change their minds
but that was something i wished you would say to my face
but you ran away


could you tell me what did i do?
because it can't be we're already through
did you sell me out for a fool after you held me?
was that just what you do?
what did you need from me?
tell me


if i had a reason or a simple goodbye
baby, even a lie
yeah, yeah


tell me what did i do
'cause, baby, suddenly we're already through
did you sell me out for a fool after you held me?
was that just what you do?
what did you need from me?
and tell me


and tell me
oh-oh-oh, oh-yeah
and tell me
tell me
