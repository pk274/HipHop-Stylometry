standing on a street somewhere i don't wanna be
in a town that's made of stone
some bad directions must have me here by mistake
'cause this sure ain't what i call home


let me close my eyes for a second
see if i can get out of here, and


let my hair hang down, and i can feel the golden sun
and watch a pickup truck drive by
and i wanna tell the world how good it is to be right here
but i don't, i just sit under this tree
and i'm in tennessee


standing on a road leading to a barn
with a cat named eloise
later on, we'll all go fishing in the pond
but all we'll catch is just a summer breeze


let me close my eyes for a second
see if i can stay right here, and


let my hair hang down, and i can feel the golden sun
and watch a pickup truck drive by
and i wanna tell the world how good it is to be right here
but i don't, i just sit under this tree
and i'm in tennessee


when the pond is gone and eloise floats away
i find myself staring at the same old day
i need to go back, back to where i feel so free
well, it looks like i'm going back to tennessee


i let my hair hang down, and i can feel the golden sun
and watch a pickup truck drive by
and i wanna tell the world how good it is to be right here
but i don't, i just sit under this tree
just me and eloise
and i'm in tennessee
