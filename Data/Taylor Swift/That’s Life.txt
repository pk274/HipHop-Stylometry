like one of those fireflies
oh, it looks so good till it's in your hand
it's like one of those memories
where you can't let go but you just can't stand
it's like one of those crazy dreams
and the permanent screens in the magazines
saying, "why'd i love?
all it does is break your heart"


one morning does it all add up?
or am i just standing on the edge of crazy?
you're getting close to giving up
in a big old way, knocks you down to the other side every time
love or lie, live or die
i, well, i guess that's life


like one of those people
with the beautiful eyes and the perfect face
it's like one of those stories
where the hero dies in the very last race
like one of those endless cries
and the crazy lies of a hurting child
saying, "why did love have to hurt?
it broke my heart"


one morning does it all add up?
or am i just standing on the edge of crazy?
you're getting close to giving up
in a big old way, knocks you down to the other side every time
love or lie, live or die
i, well, i guess that's life


i always liked to think
that i was always brave enough
to try to master any push and shove
well i guess i never qualified love


one morning does it all add up?
or am i just standing on the edge of crazy?
you're getting close to giving up
in a big old way, knocks you down to the other side every time
love or lie, live or die
i, well, i guess that's life

oh, i guess that's life
well, i guess that's life
