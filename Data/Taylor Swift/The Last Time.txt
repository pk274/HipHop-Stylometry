you find yourself at my door
and just like all those times before
you wear your best apology
but i was there to watch you leave
and all the times i let you in
just for you to go again
disappear when you come back
everything is better


this is the last time you tell me i've got it wrong
this is the last time i say it's been you all along
this is the last time i let you in my door
this is the last time, i won't hurt you anymore
oh-ho, oh-ho, oh-ho, oh-ho
oh-ho, oh-ho, oh-ho, oh-ho

this is the last time i'm asking you this (this is the last time i'm asking you this)
put my name at the top of your list (put my name at the top of your list)
this is the last time i'm asking you why (this is the last time i'm asking you why)
you break my heart in the blink of an eye (you break my heart)
