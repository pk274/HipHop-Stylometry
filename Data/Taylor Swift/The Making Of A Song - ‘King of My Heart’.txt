we met a few weeks ago
now you try on callin' me baby, like tryin' on clothes

like trying on clothes, salute to me like the american dream


salute to me, i'm your american queen
and you move to me like a motown beat
and we rule the kingdom inside my room

taylor
salute to me, i'm your american queen
and you move to me like i'm a motown beat
and we rule the kingdom inside my room
and all the boys with their expensive cars
and their range rovers and their jaguars
never took me quite where you do


and all at once, you are the one i have been waiting for
king of my heart, body, and soul, ooh whoa


is the end of all the endings?
my broken bones are mending
with all these nights we're spending
up on your roof with a school girl crush
drinking beer out of plastic cups
say you fancy me, not fancy stuff
all at once, this is enough


and all at once, you are the one i have been waiting for
king of my heart, body, and soul, ooh whoathe next day
