stumble up the porch step
you sat down in the car
only thirteen blocks across this town
to get to where you are
and that don’t offer me much time
to make up my mind
so i best be driving slow
on my way to letting go


these headlights they just wanna fade
off into the night
but if they’re half as stubborn as me
they’ll just keep on shining bright
i ain’t ever been one to settle like
the dust does on the dash
since the feeling ain’t strong
i’ll just move on
and leave this in my past


once you're gone i know your memory'll
somehow get the best of me
so i question everything i do
unsure of turning you away
wonderin' 'bout how i'll feel the day
i see you find somebody new
so i’ve been holding on
way too long
but not another minute
i'm gonna miss you bad but
can’t call it love if you ain’t in it


red light turns to green
then back to red again
i wish there were some other travelers out here
to slow my travelling
even though the wheel rolled on
inside i still don’t know
oh and it troubles me so, oh


once you're gone i know your memory'll
somehow get the best of me
so i question everything i do
unsure of turning you away
wonderin' 'bout how i'll feel the day
i see you found somebody new
and i’ve been holding on
way too long
but not another minute
i might miss you bad but
can’t call it love if you ain’t in it


once you're gone i know your memory'll
somehow get the best of me
so i question everything i do
unsure of turning you away
wonderin' 'bout how i'll feel the day
i see you find somebody new
so i’ve been holding on
way too long
but not another minute
i'm gonna miss you bad but
can’t call it love if you ain’t in it


your car comes to a rest in the drive
you open up the door and i see you smile
