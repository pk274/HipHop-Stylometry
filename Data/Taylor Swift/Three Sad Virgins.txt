ben is like a sad ron weasley
he looks like if big bird lost all his feathers
and martin has the charm and the sex appeal of a scarecrow
(that's not true!)
john has a big-ass bowling ball head
how does he stay upright with that big, fat melon?
and none of them have the guts to take their shirts off
in front of a girl
(yeah, that's accurate, true)


'cause they're three sad virgins, what? (whoa-oh-oh)
three sad virgins, whoa
three sad virgins, what?
three sad virgins, whoa
three sad virgins, what?
three sad virgins, whoa
three sad virgins, what?


and they're gonna die alone
