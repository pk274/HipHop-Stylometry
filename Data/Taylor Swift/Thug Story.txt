i'm like eight foot fo', blonde hair to the floor
you shorties never thought i dreamed about rapping hardcore
no i ain't got a gun, no i never really been in a club
still live with my parents, but i'm still a thug
i'm so gangster, you can find me baking cookies at night
you out clubbing but i just made caramel delights
t-swift and t-pain rapping on the same track
it's a thug story, tell me can you handle that?


i had a dream last night
i had high top nikes
i had diamonds in my mouth
and diamonds on my mic
by the time i woke i was singing
i'm on a boat, whoa oh-oh
'cause i'm a singer turned rapper
shorty i'm a make ya
straight to the top, yo
shorty i'm a take ya
you can call me t-sweezy
now i'm a rap star
hey, it's a thug story
now tell 'em who you are
singer turned gangster
you don't want to fight me
straight to the top
in my extra small white tee


what? what? i knit sweaters, yo!
what? what? don't test me (beep)!
hey, hold on...
hold on, i didn't even say anything
i didn't even s-
what?
i said yo
yup
you guys bleeped me and i didn't even say anything
i didn't even swear
she didn't, she didn- she didn't even swear
hello? ugh!
