do you remember the day
i leaned up against your car
and it started rolling down the street?
you screamed and ran after it
and tried to open the door
and it ran over your foot
and i was too busy laughing on the ground to see


it would take brad pitt to leave you
it takes five seconds to need you
when i'm mad at all the lovebirds
'cause they don't know to play our song
i wish that pretty girls couldn't see you
i wish that all your roads would lead you right to me
'cause that's where you belong
until brad pitt comes along


do you remember the time we watched carrie
and you said it reminded you of me?
and i threw the remote at you
and you said "my point exactly"
and later on that night, under the neon city lights
you paid a homeless guy to sing a song to me


it would take brad pitt to leave you
it takes five seconds to need you
when i'm mad at all the lovebirds
'cause they don't know to play our song
i wish that pretty girls couldn't see you
i wish that all your roads would lead you right to me
'cause that's where you belong
until brad pitt comes along


you call me lucky 'cause i lose everything
but i swear i'd be careful with it
if you gave me a ring


it would take brad pitt to leave you
it takes five seconds to need you
when i'm mad at all the lovebirds
'cause they don't know to play our song
i wish that pretty girls couldn't see you
i wish that all your roads would lead you right to me
'cause that's where you belong
until brad pitt comes along
