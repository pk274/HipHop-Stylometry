you said the way my blue eyes shined
put those georgia stars to shame that night
i said, "that's a lie"
just a boy in a pickup truck
that had a funny way of getting stuck
on backroads at night


i was right there beside you all summer long
then in time we woke up to find that summer gone


when you think tim mcgraw
hope you think my favorite song
the one we danced to all night long
the moon like a spotlight on the lake
when you think happiness
i hope you think that little black dress
the one you said you liked best
next to my old faded pair of jeans
when you think tim mcgraw
i hope you think me


september saw a month of tears
thanking god that you weren't here
to see me like that
in a box beneath my bed
sits a letter that you never read
from three summers back


it's hard not to find it all bittersweet
but looking back on all of that it's nice to believe


when you think tim mcgraw
hope you think my favorite song
the one we danced to all night long
the moon like a spotlight on the lake
when you think happiness
i hope you think that little black dress
the one you said you liked best
next to my old faded pair of jeans
when you think tim mcgraw
i hope you think me


been back a couple times since then
and i didn't look you up
but some trains you can't catch again
you gotta leave it as it was


but when you think tim mcgraw
hope you think my favorite song
the one we danced to all night long
the moon like a spotlight on the lake
when you think happiness
i hope you think that little black dress
the one you said you liked best
next to my old faded pair of jeans
when you think tim mcgraw
when you think tim mcgraw
when you think tim mcgraw
i hope you think me


you said the way my blue eyes shined
put those georgia stars to shame that night
i said, "that's a lie"
