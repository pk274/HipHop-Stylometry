so maybe it's true that i can't live without you
and maybe two is better than one
but there's so much time to figure out the rest of my life
and you've already got me coming undone
and i'm thinking two is better than one


i remember every look upon your face
the way you roll your eyes, the way you taste
you make it hard for breathing
'cause when i close my eyes and drift away
i think of you and everything's okay
i'm finally now believing


then maybe it's true that i can't live without you
and maybe two is better than one
but there's so much time to figure out the rest of my life
and you've already got me coming undone
and i'm thinking two is better than one


maybe it's true that i can't live without you
and maybe two is better than one
but there's so much time to figure out the rest of my life
and you've already got me coming undone


and i'm thinking, ooh, i can't live without you
'cause, baby, two is better than one
there's so much time to figure out the rest of my life
but i'll figure out with all that's said and done
two is better than one
two is better than one
