are you trying to make me fall?
'cause with a face like that, baby
it won't take too long
keep on melting me with those eyes
and i think in a while i'll be hypnotized
sitting here singing


ooh, ooh, ooh, i love you i love you
ooh, ooh, ooh, come a little closer
oh, oh, i love you i love you
and i'm down to my last breath
trying to get my heels back under my head


baby somewhere around the time
the moment i saw you
with your hair all sticking up
i was all caught up
'cause baby you were so damn cute
i need you to need me
see the train is coming for me
help me, save me from this crash at last


ooh, ooh, ooh, i love you i love you
ooh, ooh, ooh, come a little closer
oh, oh, i love you i love you
and i'm down to my last breath
trying to get my heels back under my head


na na na na na na na na na na na
you seem to be just what i've tried to find
and your name looks so good written next to mine
next to mine
next to mine
ooh, ooh, ooh, i love you i love you
ooh, ooh i really really want you
oh, oh i love you i love you
oh, oh..
