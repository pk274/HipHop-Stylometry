draw the cat eye sharp enough to kill a man
you did some bad things, but i'm the worst of them
sometimes i wonder which one'll be your last lie
they say looks can kill and i might try
i don't dress for women
i don't dress for men
lately, i've been dressin' for revenge


i don't start shit, but i can tell you how it ends
don't get sad, get even
so on the weekends
i don't dress for friends
lately, i've been dressin' for revenge
(put a little honey in it)
