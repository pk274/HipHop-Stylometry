if you had only gotten to me first
if i could write a book on how this hurts
if you could see the way your smile looks to me
if i wasn't scared of the world alone
if i didn't know he loves me so
if i could only find the strength to leave
you'd be with me, so baby


don't you look in my eyes
i might fall in love
with a beautiful boy
i wish that i could touch
you go i hope you think of me
as the stars fall down and the heavens fade
this girl is begging wait for me


it's so wrong that all i wanna do
is forget it all and just be with you
i have to go 'cause he don't know
but the writing's on the wall
but here we are in so deep, soaking wet
jumping in without no safety net
and i don't know what kinda ropes
would break this kinda fall, so baby


don't you look in my eyes
i might fall in love
with a beautiful boy
i wish that i could touch
you go, i hope you think of me
as the stars fall down and the heavens fade
this girl is begging wait, wait for me


we can't be together right now
guess there's no use in trying
but if you look at me right now
can you tell that i'm dying
to hold you
but it would be wrong to


so don't you look in my eyes
i might fall in love
with a beautiful boy
i wish that i could touch
you go i hope you think of me
as the stars fall down and the heavens fade
this girl is begging wait for me


don't you look now
don't you look now
i might fall in love
don't you look now
