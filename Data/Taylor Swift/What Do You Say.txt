what do you say, when you just know
that he's the one, and you want to go fast
but he's taking it slow?
and what do you do, when he's next to you
but he's a little bit shy?
well, here's something you can try


hey, hey what do you say
we go walking down the river all together?
it's a warm may beautiful day
and i feel like i could
talk to you forever
with the sun shining bright
it feels just like a day
when everything's going to go just right
i know it will be a sweet memory
for you and me someday
what do you say?


what do you see, when you look in his eyes?
there's something there
that he can't disguise
no matter how he tries
and what do you feel, when you know it's real?
and you can't sit still
if you don't own up, will you?


hey, hey what do you say
we go walking down the river all together?
it's a warm may beautiful day
and i feel like i could
talk to you forever
with the sun shining bright
it feels just like a day
when everything's going to go just right
i know it will be a sweet memory
for you and me someday
what do you say?


my imagination's running away
just dreaming about
what i want you to say


hey, hey what do you say
we go walking down the river all together?
it's a warm may beautiful day
and i feel like i could
talk to you forever
with the sun shining bright
it feels just like a day
when everything's going to go just right
i know it will be a sweet memory
for you and me someday
what do you say?
