she's looking in the mirror
the moment's getting nearer
she thinks about it as she walks her walk
up and down the staircase
make up fresh on her face
she thinks about it as she talks her talk


school dance, first chance
always been a dreamer
there's one guy, she's shy
sees him through the mirror
and everybody looks at her
she thinks about it
blue dress, angel face
looking in the mirror
shoes, purse, hair tied back
and you should see her
she's got her magic
floating through the air


peace, love
one thing leads into another
dream big, aim small
man you got to love her
she's got her hopes up
got them up to there
wondering what to wear


she's standing in her bedroom
he'll be pulling up soon
she thinks about it when she sees headlights
looking out the window
she's got her diary to show
that she's been waiting for this all her life
first date, can't wait
looking in the mirror
heart all wrapped up
wait until he sees her
he's looking right at her
she thinks about it
sixteen blue jeans, abercrombie t-shirt
shoes, purse, hair tied back
and you should see her
she's got her magic
floating through the air




the years went by
the mirror saw her cry
she got up again
she got up again
the wind blew by
the small town lights
she got up again
move out, find out
where the world can take her
bright lights, late nights
living for the greater
move to paris
living on a prayer


peace, love
one thing leads into another
dream big, aim small
man you got to love her
she's got her hopes up
got them up to there
she's got her hopes up
got them up to there
wondering what to wear


oh, oh, oh
wondering what to wear
