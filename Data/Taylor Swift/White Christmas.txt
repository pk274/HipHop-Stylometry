i'm dreaming of a white christmas
just like the ones i used to know
where the tree tops glisten and children listen
to hear sleigh bells in the snow


i'm dreaming of a white christmas
with every christmas card i write
may your days be merry and bright
and may all your christmases be white


i'm dreaming of a white christmas
just like the ones i used to know
so may your days be merry and bright
and may all your christmases be white


may your days be merry and bright
and may all your christmases be white
