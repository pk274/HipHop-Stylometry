i tried to impress you
it didn’t matter to you, i don’t matter to you
but you tried to make me think i was crazy
“put all these dreams on hold,” that’s what i was being told


tugging at my heartstrings
every little part sings, “ooh, you’re gonna bring me down”
but i don’t need to know what you don’t need to show
well i don’t wanna go down


so why do you tell me you believe in heaven?
then you get me where it hurts just when i turned around
and i try to fight this hole inside, it’s tearing me to pieces
why do you tell me you believe in me?
you believe in me


it hurts so bad to hear you say it
did i really go so wrong? tell me now, what’s going on?
hearts fall like a broken angel
did you mean to break me down every time i turn around?
