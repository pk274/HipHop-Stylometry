tonight you're mine completely
you give your love so sweetly
tonight the light of love is in your eyes
but will you love me tomorrow? (will you still love me baby?)
(will you still love me baby?)


is this a lasting treasure
or just one moment's pleasure?
can i believe the magic of your sigh?
will you still love me tomorrow?


tonight with words unspoken
you say that i'm the only one
but will my heart be broken
when the night (when the night)
meets the morning sun?


i'd like to know that your love
is love i can bе sure of
so tell me now, and i won't ask again
will you still lovе me tomorrow?


will you still love me tomorrow? (will you still love me baby?)
will you still love me, will you?
will you still love me, will you?
will you still love me (will you) tomorrow?
