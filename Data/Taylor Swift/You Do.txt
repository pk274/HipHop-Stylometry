here i am, once again
in your driveway, thinking i should be leaving
i should go but it's so entertaining watching you breathing
you went and got to me like
the stupid song on the radio that you try to forget
but it sticks in your head
so goodbye, it's not goodnight
cause i'll be seeing you in my dreamin'


boy, you got me like a shot to the heart
got me shakin' so bad, spilled my coffee in the car
caught a red light i ran right through
gotta call my friends, tell them all about you
always looking like one of those nights
when you're thinkin' 'bout kissing 'til the morning light
you got me, you do


in a daze, pull the shades
close my eyes and picture you at my window
i relax, i go back to all the things you said
that only i know


boy, you got me like a shot to the heart
got me shakin' so bad, spilled my coffee in the car
caught a red light i ran right through
gotta call my friends, tell them all about you
always looking like one of those nights
when you're thinkin' 'bout kissing 'til the morning light
you got me, you do


i'm runnin' right out to my car
and i pull out the drive
it's only been ten minutes
but i have to see you one more time


boy, you got me like a shot to the heart
got me shakin' so bad, spilled my coffee in the car
caught a red light i ran right through
gotta call my friends, tell them all about you
always looking like one of those nights
when you're thinkin' 'bout kissing 'til the morning light
you got me, you do
