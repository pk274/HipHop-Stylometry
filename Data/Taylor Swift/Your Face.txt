i heard a song tonight on the radio
another girl sings about a boy
just sees his face in every space in every room
and i know that if i turn around you won't be there
if i close my eyes will you be there?


i don't want to lose your face
i don't want to wake one day
and not remember what time erased
and i don't want to turn around
because i’m not scared of
what love
gave me and took away
and i don't want to lose your face


i've got a picture of you in my bedroom
and i hope it never falls
and i hope i never lose that feeling
i used to get when you would call
and now i wonder to myself
who were you and where are you?
were you ever here at all?


i don't want to lose your face
i don't want to wake one day
and not remember what time erased
and i don't want to turn around
because i’m not scared of
what love
gave me and took away
and i don't want to lose your face


that girl in the song had it so good
i wish i could close my eyes and see you
i wish the sky had your face
and the oceans had your eyes
and the sunset had your lips
and i had you


i don't want to lose your face
i don't want to wake one day
and not remember what time erased
and i don't want to turn around
because i’m not scared of
what love
gave me and took away
and i don't want to lose your face


oh no no
i don't want to lose your face
i don't want to turn around
oh-oh lose your face, yeah
i don't want to lose your face
i don't want to lose your face
