you say, "i don't understand," and i say, "i know you don't"
we thought a cure would come through in time, now, i fear it won't
remember lookin' at this room? we loved it 'cause of the light
now, i just sit in the dark and wonder if it's time


do i throw out everything we built or keep it?
i'm getting tired even for a phoenix
always risin' from the ashes
mendin' all her gashes
you might just have dealt the final blow


stop, you're losin' me
stop, you're losin' me
stop, you're losin' me
i can't find a pulse
my heart won't start anymore for you
'cause you're losin' me


every mornin', i glared at you with storms in my eyes
how can you say that you love someone you can't tell is dyin'?
i sent you signals and bit my nails down to the quick
my face was gray, but you wouldn't admit that we were sick


and the air is thick with loss and indecision
i know my pain is such an imposition
now, you're runnin' down the hallway
and you know what they all say
"you don't know what you got until it's gone"


stop, you're losin' me
stop, you're losin' me
stop, you're losin' me
i can't find a pulse
my heart won't start anymore for you
'cause you're losin' me
'cause you're losin' me
stop (stop) 'cause you're losin' me


my heart won't start anymore
(stop 'cause you're losin' me)
my heart won't start anymore
(stop 'cause you're losin' me)


how long could we be a sad song
'til we were too far gone to bring back to life?
i gave you all my best me's, my endless empathy
and all i did was bleed as i tried to be the bravest soldier
fighting in only your army, frontlines, don't you ignore me
i'm the best thing at this party (you're losin' me)
and i wouldn't marry me either
a pathological people pleaser
who only wanted you to see her
and i'm fadin', thinkin'
"do something, babe, say something" (say something)
"lose something, babe, risk something" (you're losin' me)
"choose something, babe, i got nothing" (i got nothing)
"to believe, unless you're choosin' me"


you're losin' me
stop (stop, stop), you're losin' me
stop (stop, stop), you're losin' me
i can't find a pulse
my heart won't start anymore
