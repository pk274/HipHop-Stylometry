vintage tee, brand new phone
high heels on cobblestones
when you are young, they assume you know nothing
sequin smile, black lipstick
sensual politics
when you are young, they assume you know nothing


but i knew you
dancin' in your levi's
drunk under a streetlight, i
i knew you
hand under my sweatshirt
baby, kiss it better, i


a friend to all is a friend to none
chase two girls, lose the one
when you are young, they assume you know nothing


but i knew you
living in a gold age
sneaking to my bird cage, i
i knew you
laughing like a damn fool
breaking every damn rule, i


and to kiss in cars and downtown bars
was all we needed
you drew stars around my scars
now i'm bleedin'
i'm bleedin'


i knew you
steppin' on the last train
marked me like a bloodstain, i
i knew you
tried to change the ending
peter leaving wendy, i
i knew you
dancing in your levi's
drunk under a streetlight, i
i knew you
that when you are young, they assume you know nothing


but i knew you'd linger like a stolen kiss
i knew you'd haunt all of my what-ifs
the smell of smoke would hang around this long
'cause i knew everything when i was young
i knew i'd curse you for the longest time
i knew i'd wish you would've changed your mind
i knew you'd miss me once the moment died
i knew to love would be to lose my mind

and then, i don't know. you let me know what you think. and, uh, that's just kind of like a rough idea of... something. let me know if you like it.Â
