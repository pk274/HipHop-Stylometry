gray november
i've been down since july
motion capture
put me in a bad light
i replay my footsteps on each stepping stone
trying to find the one where i went wrong
writing letters
addressed to the fire


and i was catchin' my breath
starin' out an open window, catchin' my death
and i couldn't be sure
i had a feeling so peculiar
that this pain would be for
evermore


hey, december
guess i'm feeling unmoored
can't remember
what i used to fight for
i rewind thе tape, but all it does is pause
on thе very moment all was lost
sending signals
to be double-crossed


and i was catchin' my breath
barefoot in the wildest winter, catchin' my death
and i couldn't be sure
i had a feeling so peculiar
that this pain would be for
evermore


can't not think of all the cost
and the things that will be lost
oh, can we just get a pause?
to be certain we'll be tall again
whether weather be the frost
or the violence of the dog days
i'm on waves, out being tossed
is there a line that i could just go cross?
and when i was shipwrecked (can't think of all the cost now)
i thought of you (all the things that will be lost now)
in the cracks of light (can we just get a pause?)
i dreamed of you (to be certain we'll be tall again)
(if you think of all the cost)
it was real enough (whether weather be the frost)
to get me through (or the violence of the dog days)
(or the violence of the dog days)
(out on waves, being tossed)
(i'm on waves, out being tossed)
but i swear (is there a line that we can just go cross?)
you were there


and i was catchin' my breath
floors of a cabin creakin' under my step
and i couldn't be sure
i had a feeling so peculiar
this pain wouldn't be for
evermore


evermore (evermore)
evermore (evermore)
this pain wouldn't be for evermore
evermore
