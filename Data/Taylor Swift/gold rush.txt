gleaming, twinkling
eyes like sinking
ships on waters
so inviting, i almost jump in


but i don't like a gold rush, gold rush
i don't like anticipatin' my face in a red flush
i don't like that anyone would die to feel your touch
everybody wants you
everybody wonders what it would be like to love you
walk past, quick brush
i don't like slow motion, double vision in rose blush
i don't like that falling feels like flying 'til the bone crush
everybody wants you
but i don't like a gold rush


what must it be like to grow up that beautiful?
with your hair falling into place like dominoes
i see me padding across your wooden floors
with my eagles t-shirt hanging from the door


'cause i don't like a gold rush, gold rush
i don't like anticipatin' my face in a red flush
i don't like that anyone would die to feel your touch
everybody wants you
everybody wonders what it would be like to love you
walk past, quick brush
i don't like slow motion, double vision in rose blush
i don't like that falling feels like flying 'til the bone crush
everybody wants you
but i don't like a gold rush


what must it be like to grow up that beautiful?
with your hair falling into place like dominoes
my mind turns your life into folklore
i can't dare to dream about you anymore


gleaming, twinkling
eyes like sinking
ships on waters
so inviting, i almost jump in
