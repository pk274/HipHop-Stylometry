ok, here’s the westerly one, written in westerly


i'm like the water when your ship rolled in that night
rough on the surface, but you cut through like a knife
and if it was an open-shut case
i never would've known from the look on your face
drown in your current like a priceless wine


the more that you say, the less i know
wherever you stray, i follow
i'm begging for you to take my hand
wreck my plans, that's my man


life was a willow and it bent right to your wind
hеad on the pillow, i could feel you sneakin' in
as if you werе a mythical thing
like you were a trophy or a champion ring
and it was only one game i'd die  to win


the more that you say, the less i know
wherever you stray, i follow
i'm begging for you to take my hand
wreck my plans, that's my man
you know that my train could take you home
anywhere else is hollow
begging for you to take my hand
wreck my plans, that's my man


wait for the signal, and i'll meet you after dark
show me the places where the others gave you scars
now this is an open-shut case
i guess i should've known from the look on your face
every bait-and-switch was a work of art


the more that you say, the less i know
wherever you stray, i follow
begging for you to take my hand
wreck my plans, that's my man
you know that my train could take you home
anywhere else is hollow
i'm begging for you to take my hand
wreck my plans, that's my man
the more that you say, the less i know
wherever you stray, i follow
begging for you to take my hand
wreck my plans, that's my man
you know that my train could take you home
anywhere else is hollow
begging for you to take my hand
wreck my plans, that's my man


hey, that's my man
yeah, that's my man
yeah, that's my man
every bait-and-switch was a work of art
that's my man
hey, that's my man
i'm begging for you to take my hand
wreck my plans, that's my man
