i once loved a girl, her skin it was bronze
with the innocence of a lamb, she was gentle like a fawn
i courted her proudly but now she is gone
gone as the season she's taken


in a young summer's youth, i stole her away
from her mother and sister, though close did they stay
each one of them suffering from the failures of their day
with strings of guilt they tried hard to guide us


of the two sisters, i loved the young
with sensitive instincts, she was the creative one
their constant scrapegoat, she was easily undone
by the jealousy of others around her


for her parasite sister, i had no respect
bound by her boredom, her pride to protect
countless visions of the other she'd reflect
as a crutch for her scenes and her society


myself, for what i did, i cannot be excused
the changes i was going through can't even be used
for the lies that i told her in hope not to lose
the could-be dream-lover of my lifetime


with unseen consciousness, i possessed in my grip
a magnificent mantelpiece, though its heart being chipped
noticing not that i'd already slipped
to the sin of love's false security


from silhouetted anger to manufactured peace
answers of emptiness voice vacancies
'til the tombstones of damage read no questions but please
what's wrong, what's exactly the matter?


and so it did happen like it could have been foreseen
the timeless explosion of fantasy's dream
at the peak of the night, the king and the queen
tumbled all down into pieces


"the tragic figure" her sister did shout
"leave her alone, god damn you, get out"
and i in my armor, turning about
and nailing her in the ruins of her pettiness


beneath a bare light bulb the plaster did pound
her sister and i in a screaming battleground
and she in between, the victim of sound
soon shattered as a child to the shadows


all is gone, all is gone, admit it, take flight
i gagged in contradiction, tears blinding my sight
my mind it was mangled, i ran into the night
leaving all of love's ashes behind me


the wind knocks my window, the room it is wet
the words to say i'm sorry, i haven't found yet
i think of her often and hope whoever she's met
will be fully aware of how precious she is


ah, my friends from the prison, they ask unto me
"how good, how good does it feel to be free?"
and i answer them most mysteriously
"are birds free from the chains of the skyway?"

hollis brown, he lived on the outside of town
hollis brown, he lived on the outside of town
with his wife and five children and his cabin broken down


he looked for work and money and he walked a ragged mile
he looked for work and money and ya walked a ragged mile
your children are so hungry that they don't know how to smile


your baby's eyes look crazy, they're a-tugging at your sleeve
your baby's eyes look crazy, they're a-tugging at your sleeve
you walk the floor and wonder why with every breath you breathe


the rats have got your flour, bad blood, it got your mare
the rats have got your flour, bad blood, it got your mare
if there's anyone that knows is there anyone that cares?


he prayed to the lord above, oh, please send you a friend
he prayed to the lord above, oh, please send you a friend
your empty pockets tell ya that you ain't a-got no friend


your babies are crying louder now, it's a-poundin' on your brain
your babies are crying louder now, it's a-poundin' on your brain
your wife's screams are stabbin' ya like the dirty drivin' rain


your grass is turnin' black, there's no water in your well
your grass is turnin' black, there's no water in your well
you spent your last lone dollar on seven shotgun shells


way out in the wilderness a cold coyote calls
way out in the wilderness a cold coyote calls
your eyes fix on the shotgun that's hanging on the wall


your brain is a-bleedin' and your legs can’t seem to stand
your brain is a-bleedin' and your legs can’t seem to stand
your eyes fix on the shotgun that you're holding in your hand


there's seven breezes blowin' all around the cabin door
there's seven breezes blowin' all around the cabin door
seven shots ring out like the ocean's poundin' roar


there's seven people dead on a south dakota farm
there's seven people dead on a south dakota farm
somewheres in the distance there's seven new people born

oh, i'm sailin' away, my own true love
i'm a-sailin' away in the mornin'
is there somethin' i can send you from across the sea
from the place that i'll be landin'?


no, there's nothin' you can send me, my own true love
there's nothin' i'm a-wishing to be ownin'
just a-carry yourself back to me unspoiled
from across that lonesome ocean


ah, but i just thought you might want somethin' fine
made of silver or of golden
either from the mountains of madrid
or from the coast of barcelona


but if i had the stars of the darkest night
and the diamonds from the deepest ocean
i'd forsake them all for your sweet kiss
for that's all i'm wishin' to be ownin'


well, i might be gone a long old time
and it's only that i'm asking
is there somethin' i can send you to remember me by
to make your time more easy passin'?


oh, how can, how can you ask me again?
it only brings me sorrow
the same thing i would want today
i would want again tomorrow


oh, i got a letter on a lonesome day
it was from her ship a-sailin'
sayin', "i don't know when i'll be comin' back again
it depends on how i'm a-feelin'"


if a-you, my love, must think that-a-way
i'm sure your mind is a-roamin'
i'm sure your thoughts are not with me
but with the country to where you're goin'


so, take heed, take heed of the western winds
take heed of the stormy weather
and, yes, there's somethin' you can send back to me
spanish boots of spanish leather

far between sundown's finish and midnight's broken toll
we ducked inside the doorways, thunder went crashing
as majestic bells of bolts struck shadows in the sounds
seemin' to be the chimes of freedom flashing
flashing for the warriors whose strength is not to fight
flashing for the refugees on the unarmed road of flight
and for each and every underdog soldier in the night
and we gazed upon the chimes of freedom flashing


through the city's melted furnace, unexpectedly we watched
with faces hidden as the walls were tightening
as the echo of the wedding bells before the blowin' rain
dissolved into the bells of the lightning
tolling for the rebel, tolling for the rake
tolling for the luckless, they abandoned and forsaked
tolling for the outcast, burning constantly at stake
and we gazed upon the chimes of freedom flashing


through the mad mystic hammering of the wild ripping hail
the sky cracked its poems in naked wonder
that the clinging of the church bells blew far into the breeze
leavin' only bells of lightning and its thunder
striking for the gentle, striking for the kind
striking for the guardians and protectors of the mind
and the poet and the painter far behind his rightful time
and we gazed upon the chimes of freedom flashing


and the wild cathedral evening the rain unraveled tales
for disrobed faceless forms of no position
tolling for the tongues with no place to bring their thoughts
all down in taken-for-granted situations
tolling for the deaf and blind, tolling for the mute
for the mistreated, mateless mother, the mistitled prostitute
for the misdemeanor outlaw, chained and cheated by pursuit
and we gazed upon the chimes of freedom flashing


even though a cloud's white curtain in a far-off corner flared
and the hypnotic splattered mist was slowly lifting
electric light still struck like arrows, fired but for the ones
condemned to drift or else be kept from driftin'
tolling for the searching ones, on their speechless, seeking trail
for the lonesome-hearted lovers with too personal a tale
and for each unharmful, gentle soul misplaced inside a jail
and we gazed upon the chimes of freedom flashing


starry-eyed and laughing as i recall when we were caught
trapped by no track of hours for they hanged suspended
as we listened one last time and we watched with one last look
spellbound and swallowed 'til the tolling ended
tolling for the aching whose wounds cannot be nursed
for the countless confused, accused, misused, strung-out ones and worse
and for every hung-up person in the whole wide universe
and we gazed upon the chimes of freedom flashin'

i can't understand, she let go of my hand
and left me here facing the wall
i’d sure like to know why she'd go
but i can't get close to her at all

though we kissed through the wild blazing nighttime
she said she would never forget
but now morning’s clear, it’s like i ain't here
she acts like we never met


it’s all new to me, like some mystery
it could even be like a myth
but it’s hard to think on that she’s the same one
that last night i was with

from darkness, dreams are deserted
am i still dreaming yet?
i wish she’d unlock her voice once and talk
'stead of actin' like we never have met


if she ain't feelin' well, then why don’t she tell
'stead of turnin' her back to my face?
without any doubt, she seems too far out
for me to return to or chase

well her skirt it swayed as the guitar played
her mouth was watery and wet
but now something has changed, for she ain't the same
she just acts like we never have met


if i didn’t have to guess, i’d gladly confess
to anything i might’ve tried
if i was with her too long or have done something wrong
i'd wish she’d tell me what it is, i’ll run and hide

though the night ran swirling and whirling
i remember her whispering yet
but evidently she don’t, evidently she won’t
she just acts like we never have met


i’m leavin' today, i’ll be on my way
of this i can't say very much
but if you want me to, i can be just like you
and pretend that we never have touched

and if anybody asks me
“is it easy to forget?”
i’ll say, “it’s easily done, you just pick anyone
and pretend that you never have met!”

i’m just average, common too
i’m just like him, and the same as you
i’m everybody’s brother and son
i ain't different than anyone
ain't no use a-talk to me
it’s just the same as talkin' to you


i was shadow boxing early in the day
i figured i was ready for cassius clay
i said “fee, fie, fo, fum, cassius clay, here i come
26, 27, 28, 29, i’m gonna' make your face look just like mine
five, four, three, two, one, cassius clay you’d better run
99, 100, 101, 102, your ma won’t even recognize you
14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, gonna knock him clean right out of his spleen”


well, i don’t know, but i’ve been told
the streets of heaven are lined with gold
i ask ya' how things could get much worse
if the russians happen to get up there first
wowee! pretty scary!


now, i’m liberal, but to a degree
i want everybody to be free
but if you think i’ll let barry goldwater
move in next door and marry my daughter
you must think i’m crazy!
i wouldn’t let him do it for all the farms in cuba


well, i set my monkey on the log
and ordered him to do the dog
he wagged his tail and shook his head
and he went and did the cat instead
he’s a weird monkey, very funky


i sat with my high-heeled sneakers on
waitin' to play tennis in the noonday sun
i had my white shorts rolled up past my waist
and my wig-hat was fallin' in my face
but they wouldn’t let me on the tennis court


i got a woman, she’s so mean
she sticks my boots in the washing machine
sticks me with buckshot when i’m nude
puts bubblegum in my food
she’s funny, wants my money, calls me “honey”


now i got a friend who spends his life
stabbin' my picture with a bowie knife
dreams of stranglin' me with a scarf
when my name comes up he pretends to barf
i got a million friends!


now they asked me to read a poem
at the sorority sisters home
ah got knocked down and my head was swimmin'
i wound up with the dean of women
yippee! i’m a poet, and i know it
hope i don’t blow it


i’m gonna grow my hair down to my feet so strange
so i look like a walking mountain range
and i’m gonna' ride into omaha on a horse
out to the country club and the golf course
carryin' the new york times, shoot a few holes, blow their minds


now you’re probably wonderin' by now
just what this song is all about
what’s probably got you baffled more
is what this thing here is for:

(plays song's riff)

it’s nothin'
it’s sumpin' i learned over in england!

i pounded on a farmhouse looking for a place to stay
i was mighty, mighty tired, i'd come a long, long way
i said, “hey, hey, in there, is there anybody home?”
i was standin' on the steps feeling most alone
when out comes a farmer, he must've thought that i was nuts
he immediately looked at me and stuck a gun into my guts


i fell down to my bended knees
saying, “i dig farmers, don’t shoot me, please!”
he cocked his rifle and begin to shout
“are you that travelin' salesman that i have heard about?”
i said, “no! no! no! i’m a doctor and it’s true
i’m a clean-cut kid and i been to college, too”


then in comes his daughter whose name was rita
she looked like she stepped out of la dolce vita
i immediately tried to cool it with her dad
and told him what a nice, pretty farm he had
he said, “what do doctors know about farms, pray tell?”
i said, “i's born at the bottom of a wishing well”


well, by the dirt 'neath my nails, i guess he knew i wouldn’t lie
he said “i guess you’re tired," he said it kind of sly
i said, “yes, ten thousand miles today i drove”
he said, “i got a bed for you underneath the stove
just one condition, you can go to sleep right now
that you don’t touch my daughter and in the morning, milk the cows”


i was sleeping like a rat when i heard something jerkin’
there stood rita looking just like tony perkins
she said, “would you like to take a shower? i’ll show you up to the door”
i said, “oh, no, no, i’ve been through this movie before”
i knew i had to split but i did not know how
when she said “would you like to take that shower now?”


well, i couldn’t leave unless the old man chased me out
because i’d already promised that i’d milk his cows
i had to say somethin' to strike him very weird
so i yelled out “i like fidel castro and his beard”
rita looked offended but she got out of the way
as he came charging down the stairs sayin', “what’s that i heard you say?”


i said, “i like fidel castro, i think you heard me right”
and i ducked as he swung at me with all his might
rita mumbled somethin' 'bout her mother on the hill
as his fist it hit the icebox, he said he’s gonna kill me
if i don’t get out the door in two seconds flat
“you unpatriotic, rotten doctor commie rat”


well, he threw a reader’s digest at my head and i did run
i did a somersault as i seen him get his gun
and crashed through the window at a hundred miles an hour
and landed fully blast in his garden flowers
rita said, “come back!” as he started to load
the sun was coming up and i was running down the road


well, i don’t figure i’ll be back there for a spell
even though rita moved away and got a job in a motel
he still waits for me, constant, on the sly
he wants to turn me in to the f.b.i
me, i romp and stomping, thankful as i romp
without freedom of speech, i might be in the swamp

come an' gather 'round friends
and i'll tell ya a tale
of when the red iron ore pits ran a-plenty
but the cardboard-filled windows
and old men on the benches
tell you now that the whole town is empty


in the north end of town
my own children have grown
well i was raised on the other
in the wee hours of youth
my mother took sick
and i was brought up by my brother


the iron ore poured
as the years passed the door
the drag lines and the shovels they was a-hummin'
'til one day my brother
failed to come home
the same as my father before him


well a long winter's wait
from the winda' i watched
my friends they couldn'ta been kinder
and my schooling was cut
as i quit in the spring
to marry john thomas, a miner


oh, the years passed again
and the givin' was good
with the lunch bucket filled every season
what with three babies born
the work was cut down
to a half a day's shift with no reason


then the shaft was soon shut
and more work was cut
and the fire in the air, it felt frozen
'til a man come to speak
and he said in one week
that number eleven was closin'


they complained in the east
they're payin' too high
they say that your ore ain't worth a-diggin'
that it's much cheaper down
in the south american towns
where the miners work almost for nothin'


so the minin' gates locked
and the red iron rotted
and the room smelled heavy from drinkin'
when the sad silent song
made the hour twice as long
as i waited for the sun to go sinking


i lived by the window
as he talked to himself
this silence of tongues it was buildin'
'til one morning's wake
the bed it was bare
and i's left alone with three children


the summer is gone
the ground's turning cold
the stores one by one they're a-foldin'
my children will go
as soon they grow
for there ain't nothin' here now to hold them

a bullet from the back of a bush took medgar evers' blood
a finger fired the trigger to his name
a handle hid out in the dark
a hand set the spark
two eyes took the aim
behind a man's brain
but he can't be blamed
he's only a pawn in their game


a south politician preaches to the poor white man
"you got more than the blacks, don't complain
you're better than them, you been born with white skin," they explain
and the negro's name
is used, it is plain
for the politician's gain
as he rises to fame
and the poor white remains
on the caboose of the train
but it ain't him to blame
he's only a pawn in their game


the deputy sheriffs, the soldiers, the governors get paid
and the marshals and cops get the same
but the poor white man's used in the hands of them all like a tool
he's taught in his school
from the start by the rule
that the laws are with him
to protect his white skin
to keep up his hate
so he never thinks straight
'bout the shape that he's in
but it ain't him to blame
he's only a pawn in their game


from the poverty shacks, he looks from the cracks to the tracks
and the hoof beats pound in his brain
and he's taught how to walk in a pack
shoot in the back, with his fist in a clinch
to hang and to lynch
to hide 'neath the hood
to kill with no pain
like a dog on a chain
he ain't a-got no name
but it ain't him to blame
he's only a pawn in their game


today, medgar evers was buried from the bullet he caught
they lowered him down as a king
but when the shadowy sun sets on the one that fired the gun
he'll see by his grave
on the stone that remains
carved next to his name
his epitaph plain
only a pawn in their game

oh, all the money that in my whole life i did spend
be it mine right or wrongfully
i let it slip gladly to my friends
to tie up the time most forcefully


but the bottles are done
we've killed each one and the table's full and overflowed
and the corner sign says it's closin' time
so i'll bid farewell and be down the road


oh, every girl that ever i've touched
i did not do it harmfully
and every girl that ever i've hurt
i did not do it knowingly


but to remain as friends
you need the time to make amends and stay behind
and since my feet are now fast and point away from the past
i'll bid farewell and be down the line


oh, every foe that ever i faced
the cause was there before we came
and every cause that ever i fought
i fought it full without regret or shame


but the dark does die
as the curtain is drawn, and somebody's eyes must meet the dawn
and if i see the day, i'd only have to stay
so i'll bid farewell in the night and be gone


oh, every thought that's strung a knot in my mind
i might go insane if it couldn't be sprung
but it's not to stand naked under unknowin' eyes
it's for myself and my friends my stories are sung


but the time ain't tall
if on time you depend and no word is possessed by no special friend
and though the line is cut, it ain't quite the end
i'll just bid farewell 'til we meet again


oh, a false clock tries to tick out my time
to disgrace, distract and bother me
and the dirt of gossip blows into my face
and the dust of rumors covers me


but if the arrow is straight and the point is slick
it can pierce through dust no matter how thick
so i'll make my stand and remain as i am
and bid farewell and not give a damn

william zanzinger killed poor hattie carroll
with a cane that he twirled around his diamond ring finger
at a baltimore hotel society gatherin'
and the cops was called in and his weapon took from him
as they rode him in custody down to the station
and booked william zanzinger for first-degree murder


but you who philosophize disgrace
and criticize all fears
take the rag away from your face
now ain't the time for your tears


william zanzinger, who at twenty-four years
owns a tobacco farm of six hundred acres
with rich wealthy parents who provide and protect him
and high office relations in the politics of maryland
reacted to his deed with a shrug of his shoulders
and swear words and sneering, and his tongue, it was a-snarling
and in a matter of minutes, on bail was out walking


but you who philosophize disgrace
and criticize fears
take the rag away from your face
now ain't the time for your tears


hattie carroll was a maid in the kitchen
she was fifty-one years old and gave birth to ten children
who carried the dishes and took out the garbage
and never sat once at the head of the table
and didn't even talk to the people at the table
who just cleaned up all the food from the table
and emptied the ashtrays on a whole other level
got killed by a blow, lay slain by a cane
that sailed through the air and came down through the room
doomed and determined to destroy all the gentle
and she never done nothin' to william zanzinger


and you who philosophize disgrace
and criticize all fears
take the rag away from your face
now ain't the time for your tears


in the courtroom of honor, the judge pounded his gavel
to show that all's equal and that the courts are on the level
and that the strings in the books ain't pulled and persuaded
and that even the nobles get properly handled
once that the cops have chased after and caught 'em
and that the ladder of law has no top and no bottom
stared at the person who killed for no reason
who just happened to be feelin' that way without warnin'
and he spoke through his cloak, most deep and distinguished
and handed out strongly, for penalty and repentance
william zanzinger with a six-month sentence


ah, but you who philosophize disgrace
and criticize all fears
bury the rag deep in your face
for now's the time for your tears

ramona
come closer
shut softly your watery eyes
the pangs of your sadness
will pass as your senses will rise
oh the flowers of the city
though breath-like
get death-like at times
and there’s no use in trying
to deal with the dying
though i cannot explain that in lines


your cracked country lips
i still wish to kiss
as to be by the strength of your skin
your magnetic movements
still capture the minutes i’m in
but it grieves my heart, love
to see you trying to be a part of
a world that just don’t exist
it’s all just a dream, babe
a vacuum, a scheme, babe
that sucks you into feelin' like this


i can see that your head
has been twisted and fed
with the worthless foam from the mouth
i can tell you are torn
between staying and returning
back to the south
you’ve been fooled into thinking
that the finishing end is at hand
yet there’s no one to beat you
no one to defeat you
'cept the thoughts of yourself feeling bad


i’ve heard you say many times
that you’re better than no one
and no one is better than you
if you really believe that
you know you have nothing to win and nothing to lose
from fixtures and forces and friends
your sorrow does stem
that hype you and type you
making you feel
that you gotta' be just like them


i’d forever talk to you
but soon my words
would turn into a meaningless ring
for deep in my heart
i know there's no help i can bring
everything passes
everything changes
just do what you think you should do
and someday maybe
who knows, baby
i’ll come and be crying to you

oh, the time will come up
when the winds will stop
and the breeze will cease to be breathin'
like the stillness in the wind
before the hurricane begins
the hour that the ship comes in


and the sea will split
and the ships will hit
and the sands on the shoreline will be shaking
then the tide will sound
and the waves will pound
and the mornin' will be a-breakin'


the fishes will laugh
as they swim out of the path
and the seagulls, they'll be smilin'
and the rocks on the sand
will proudly stand
the hour that the ship comes in


and the words that are used
for to get the ship confused
will not be understood as they're spoken
for the chains of the sea
will have busted in the night
and be buried on the bottom of the ocean


a song will lift as the mainsail shifts
and the boat drifts onto the shoreline
and the sun will respect
every face on the deck
the hour that the ship comes in


and the sands will roll out a carpet of gold
for your weary toes to be a-touchin'
and the ship's wise men
will remind you once again
that the whole wide world is watchin'


oh, the foes will rise
with the sleep still in their eyes
and they'll jerk from their beds and think they're dreamin'
but they'll pinch themselves and squeal
and they'll know that it's for real
the hour that the ship comes in


and they'll raise their hands
sayin', "we'll meet all your demands"
but we'll shout from the bow, "your days are numbered"
and like pharoah's tribe
they'll be drowned in the tide
and like goliath, they'll be conquered

oh, my name, it ain't nothin'
my age, it means less
the country i come from
is called the midwest
i's taught and brought up there
the laws to abide
and that the land that i live in
has god on its side


oh, the history books tell it
they tell it so well
the cavalries charged
the indians fell
the cavalries charged
the indians died
ah, the country was young
with god on its side


the spanish-american
war had its day
and the civil war too
was soon laid away
and the names of the heroes
i's made to memorize
with guns in their hands
and god on their side


the first world war boys
it came and it went
the reason for fightin'
i never did get
but i learned to accept it
accept it with pride
for you don't count the dead
when god's on your side


the second world war
came to an end
we forgave the germans
and then we were friends
though they murdered six million
in the ovens they fried
the germans now too
have god on their side


i've learned to hate the russians
all through my whole life
if another war comes
it's them we must fight
to hate them and fear them
to run and to hide
and accept it all bravely
with god on my side


but now we got weapons
of chemical dust
if fire them we're forced to
then fire them we must
one push of the button
and a shot the world wide
and ya never ask questions
when god's on your side


through many dark hour
i been thinking about this
that jesus christ
was betrayed by a kiss
but i can't think for ya
you'll have to decide
whether judas iscariot
had god on his side


so now as i'm leavin'
i'm weary as hell
the confusion i'm feelin'
ain't no tongue can tell
the words fill my head
and they fall to the floor
that if god's on our side
he'll stop the next war
