you walk into the room
with your pencil in your hand
you see somebody naked
and you, you say, "who is that man?"
you try so hard
but you don't understand
just what you will say
when you get home


you raise up your head
and you ask, "is this where it is?"
and somebody points to you and says
"it's his"
and you say, "what's mine?"
and somebody else says, "well, what is?"
and you say, "oh my god, am i here all alone?"


you hand in your ticket
and you go watch the geek
who immediately walks up to you
when he hears you speak
and says, "how does it feel to
be such a freak?"
and you say, "impossible"
as he hands you a bone


you have many contacts
among the lumberjacks
to get you facts
when someone attacks your imagination
but nobody has any respect
anyway they already expect you
to all give a check
to tax-deductible charity organization
aw, you've been with the professors
and they've all liked your looks
with great lawyers you have
discussed lepers and crooks
you've been through all of
f. scott fitzgerald's books
you are very well read
it's well known


well the sword swallower, he comes up to you
and then he kneels
he crosses himself
and then he clicks his high heels
and without further notice
he asks you how it feels
and he says, "here is your throat back
thanks for the loan"


now you see this one-eyed midget
shouting the word "now"
and you say, "for what reason?"
and he says, "how?"
and you say, "what does this mean?"
and he screams back "you're a cow
give me some milk or else go home"


well, you walk into the room
like a camel and then you frown
you put your eyes in your pocket
and your nose on the ground
there oughtta be a law
against you comin' around
you should be made
to wear earphones



i was riding on the mayflower
when i thought i spied some land

i was riding on the mayflower when i thought i spied some land
i yelled for captain arab, i have you understand
who came running to the deck, said, "boys, forget the whale
look on over yonder, cut the engines, change the sail
haul on the bowline", we sang that melody
like all tough sailors do when they're far away at sea


"i think i'll call it america," i said as we hit land
i took a deep breath, i fell down, i could not stand
captain arab he started writing up some deeds
he said, "let's set up a fort and start buyin' a place with beads"
just then this cop comes down the street, crazy as a loon
he throws us all in jail for carrying harpoons


ah, me i busted out, don't even ask me how
i went to get some help, i walked by a guernsey cow
who directed me down to the bowery slums
where people carried signs around sayin', "ban the bums"
i jumped right into line sayin' "i hope that i'm not late"
when i realized i hadn't eaten for five days straight


i went into a restaurant looking for the cook
i told him i was the editor of a famous etiquette book
the waitress he was handsome, he wore a powder blue cape
i ordered some suzette, i said "could you please make that crepe?"
just then the whole kitchen exploded from boilin' fat
food was flyin' everywhere, i left without my hat


now, i didn't mean to be nosy but i went into a bank
to get some bail for arab and all the boys back in the tank
they asked me for some collateral and i pulled down my pants
they threw me in the alley when up comes this girl from france
who invited me to her house, i went but she had a friend
who knocked me out and robbed my boots and i was on the street again


well, i rapped upon a house with the u.s. flag upon display
i said, "could you help me out, i got some friends down the way"
"the man says, "get out of here, i'll tear you limb from limb"
i said, "you know they refused jesus, too", he said, "you're not him
get out of here before i break your bones, i ain't your pop"
i decided to have him arrested and i went lookin' for a cop


i ran right outside, i hopped inside a cab
i went out the other door, this englishman said, "fab"
as he saw me leap a hot dog stand and a chariot that stood
parked across from a building advertising brotherhood
i ran right through the front door like a hobo sailor does
but it was just a funeral parlor and the man asked me who i was


i repeated that my friends were all in jail with a sigh
he gave me his card, he said, "call me if they die"
i shook his hand and said goodbye, ran out to the street
when a bowling ball came down the road and knocked me off my feet
a pay phone was ringing and it just about blew my mind
when i picked it up and said hello, this foot came through the line


well, by this time i's fed up at tryin' to make a stab
at bringing back any help for my friends and captain arab
i decided to flip a coin like either heads or tails
would let me know if i should go back to ship or back to jail
so i hocked my sailor suit and i got a coin to flip
it came up tails, it rhymed with sails, so i made it back to the ship


well, i got back and took the parking ticket off the mast
i was ripping it to shreds when this coastguard boat went past
they asked me my name and i said, "captain kidd"
they believed me but they wanted to know what exactly that i did
i said for the pope of eruke i was employed
they let me go right away, they were very paranoid


well, the last i heard of arab, he was stuck on a whale
that was married to the deputy sheriff of the jail
but the funniest thing was when i was leavin' the bay
i saw three ships sailin' there, were all heading my way
i asked the captain what his name was and how come he didn't drive a truck
he said his name was columbus, i just said, "good luck"

they're selling postcards of the hanging
they're painting the passports brown
the beauty parlor is filled with sailors
the circus is in town
here comes the blind commissioner
they've got him in a trance
one hand is tied to the tight-rope walker
the other is in his pants
and the riot squad, they're restless
they need somewhere to go
as lady and i look out tonight
from desolation row

cinderella, she seems so easy
"it takes one to know one," she smiles
and puts her hands in her back pockets
bette davis style
and in comes romeo, he's moaning
"you belong to me, i believe"
and someone says, "you're in the wrong place, my friend
you'd better leave"
and the only sound that's left
after the ambulances go
is cinderella sweeping up
on desolation row


now the moon is almost hidden
the stars are beginning to hide
the fortune-telling lady
has even taken all her things inside
all except for cain and abel
and the hunchback of notre dame
everybody is making love
or else expecting rain
and the good samaritan, he's dressing
he's getting ready for the show
he's going to the carnival tonight
on desolation row

ophelia, she's 'neath the window
for her i feel so afraid
on her twenty-second birthday
she already is an old maid
to her, death is quite romantic
she wears an iron vest
her profession's her religion
her sin is her lifelessness
and though her eyes are fixed upon
noah's great rainbow
she spends her time peeking
into desolation row


einstein, disguised as robin hood
with his memories in a trunk
passed this way an hour ago
with his friend, a jealous monk
now he looked so immaculately frightful
as he bummed a cigarette
then he went off sniffing drainpipes
and reciting the alphabet
you would not think to look at him
but he was famous long ago
for playing the electric violin
on desolation row

dr. filth, he keeps his world
inside of a leather cup
but all his sexless patients
they're trying to blow it up
now his nurse, some local loser
she's in charge of the cyanide hole
and she also keeps the cards that read
"have mercy on his soul"
they all play on the pennywhistle
you can hear them blow
if you lean your head out far enough
from desolation row


across the street they've nailed the curtains
they're getting ready for the feast
the phantom of the opera
in a perfect image of a priest
they are spoon feeding casanova
to get him to feel more assured
then they'll kill him with self-confidence
after poisoning him with words
and the phantom's shouting to skinny girls
"get outta here if you don't know
casanova is just being punished for going
to desolation row"


at midnight all the agents
and the superhuman crew
come out and round up everyone
that knows more than they do
then they bring them to the factory
where the heart attack machine
is strapped across their shoulders
and then the kerosene
is brought down from the castles
by insurance men who go
check to see that nobody is escaping
to desolation row

praise be to nero's neptune
the titanic sails at dawn
everybody's shouting
"which side are you on?"
and ezra pound and t. s. eliot
fighting in the captain's tower
while calypso singers laugh at them
and fishermen hold flowers
between the windows of the sea
where lovely mermaids flow
and nobody has to think too much
about desolation row


yes, i received your letter yesterday
about the time the doorknob broke
when you asked me how i was doing
was that some kinda joke?
all these people that you mention
yes, i know them, they're quite lame
i had to rearrange their faces
and give them all another name
right now, i can't read too good
don't send me no more letters, no
not unless you mail them
from desolation row



of war and peace the truth just twists
its curfew gull it glides
upon four-legged forest clouds
the cowboy angel rides
with his candle lit into the sun
though its glow is waxed in black
all except when 'neath the trees of eden


the lamppost stands with folded arms
its iron claws attached
to curbs 'neath holes where babies wail
though it shadows metal badge
all and all can only fall
with a crashing but meaningless blow
no sound ever comes from the gates of eden


the savage soldier sticks his head in sand
and then complains
unto the shoeless hunter who's gone deaf
but still remains
upon the beach where hound dogs bay
at ships with tattooed sails
heading for the gates of eden


with a time-rusted compass blade
aladdin and his lamp
sits with utopian hermit monks
sidesaddle on the golden calf
and on their promises of paradise
you will not hear a laugh
all except inside the gates of eden


relationships of ownership
they whisper in the wings
to those condemned to act accordingly
and wait for succeeding kings
and i try to harmonize with songs
the lonesome sparrow sings
there are no kings inside the gates of eden


the motorcycle black madonna
two-wheeled gypsy queen
and her silver-studded phantom cause
the gray flannel dwarf to scream
as he weeps to wicked birds of prey
who pick up on his bread crumb sins
and there are no sins inside the gates of eden


the kingdoms of experience
in the precious winds they rot
while paupers change possessions
each one wishing for what the other has got
and the princess and the prince discuss
what's real and what is not
it doesn't matter inside the gates of eden


the foreign sun, it squints upon
a bed that is never mine
as friends and other strangers
from their fates try to resign
leaving men wholly, totally free
to do anything they wish to do but die
and there are no trials inside the gates of eden


at dawn my lover comes to me
and tells me of her dreams
with no attempts to shovel the glimpse
into the ditch of what each one means
at times i think there are no words
but these to tell what's true
and there are no truths outside the gates of eden

oh, god said to abraham, “kill me a son”
abe said, “man, you must be puttin' me on”
god say, “no.”
abe say, “what?”
god say, “you can do what you want, abe, but
the next time you see me comin' you better run”
well, abe said, “where you want this killin' done?"
god said, “out on highway 61”


well, georgia sam, he had a bloody nose
welfare department, they wouldn’t give him no clothes
he asked poor howard, "where can i go?"
howard said, "there’s only one place i know"
sam said, "tell me quick, man, i got to run"
oh, howard just pointed with his gun
and said, "that way, down highway 61"


well, mack the finger said to louie the king
"i got forty red, white and blue shoestrings
and a thousand telephones that don’t ring
do you know where i can get rid of these things?"
and louie the king said, "let me think for a minute, son"
and he said, "yes, i think it can be easily done!
just take everything down to highway 61"


now, the fifth daughter on the twelfth night
told the first father that things weren’t right
"my complexion," she says "is much too white"
he said, "come here and step into the light"
he says, "hmm you’re right
let me tell the second mother this has been done"
but the second mother was with the seventh son
and they were both out on highway 61


now, the rovin' gambler, he was very bored
tryin' to create a next world war
he found a promoter who nearly fell off the floor
he said, "i never engaged in this kind of thing before
but, yes, i think it can be very easily done
we’ll just put some bleachers out in the sun
and have it on highway 61"

darkness at the break of noon
shadows even the silver spoon
the handmade blade, the child's balloon
eclipses both the sun and moon
to understand you know too soon
there is no sense in trying


pointed threats they bluff with scorn
suicide remarks are torn
from the fools gold mouthpiece the hollow horn
plays wasted words, proves to warn
that he not busy being born
is busy dying


temptation's page flies out the door
you follow, find yourself at war
watch waterfalls of pity roar
you feel to moan, but unlike before
you discover that you'd just be one more
person crying


so don't fear if you hear
a foreign sound to your ear
it's alright, ma, i'm only sighing


as some warn victory, some downfall
private reasons, great or small
can be seen in the eyes of those that call
to make all that should be killed to crawl
while others say don't hate nothing at all
except hatred


disillusioned words like bullets bark
as human gods aim for their mark
make everything from toy guns that spark
to flesh-colored christs that glow in the dark
it's easy to see without looking too far
that not much is really sacred


while preachers preach of evil fates
teachers teach that knowledge waits
can lead to hundred-dollar plates
goodness hides behind its gates
but even the president of the united states
sometimes must have to stand naked


and though the rules of the road have been lodged
it's only people's games that you got to dodge
and it's alright, ma, i can make it


advertising signs that con
you into thinking you're the one
that can do what's never been done
that can win what's never been won
meantime, life outside goes on
all around you


you lose yourself, you reappear
you suddenly find you got nothing to fear
alone you stand with nobody near
when a trembling distant voice, unclear
startles your sleeping ears to hear
that somebody thinks they really found you


a question in your nerves is lit
yet you know there is no answer fit
to satisfy, ensure you not to quit
to keep it in your mind and not forget
that it is not he, or she, or them, or it
that you belong to


but though the masters make the rules
for the wise men and the fools
i got nothing, ma, to live up to


for them that must obey authority
that they do not respect in any degree
who despise their jobs, their destiny
speak jealously of them that are free
do what they do just to be
nothing more than something they invest in


while some on principles baptized
to strict party platform ties
social clubs in drag disguise
outsiders they can freely criticize
tell nothing except who to idolize
and say "god bless him"


while one who sings with his tongue on fire
gargles in the rat race choir
bent out of shape from society's pliers
cares not to come up any higher
but rather get you down in the hole
that he's in


but i mean no harm, nor put fault
on anyone that lives in a vault
but it's alright, ma, if i can't please him


old lady judges watch people in pairs
limited in sex, they dare
to push fake morals, insult and stare
while money doesn't talk, it swears
obscenity, who really cares
propaganda, all is phony


while them that defend what they cannot see
with a killer's pride, security
it blows the minds most bitterly
for them that think death's honesty
won't fall upon 'em naturally
life sometimes must get lonely


my eyes collide head-on with stuffed
graveyards, false goals, i scuff
at pettiness which plays so rough
walk upside down inside handcuffs
kick my legs to crash it off
say, okay, i've had enough
what else can you show me?


and if my thought-dreams could be seen
they'd probably put my head in a guillotine
but it's alright, ma, it's life, and life only

when you're lost in the rain in juarez
when it's easter time too
and your gravity fails
and negativity don't pull you through
don't put on any airs
when you're down on rue morgue avenue
they got some hungry women there
and they really make a mess outta you


now if you see saint annie
please tell her "thanks a lot"
i cannot move
my fingers are all in a knot
i don't have the strength
to get up and take another shot
and my best friend, my doctor
won't even say what it is i've got


sweet melinda
the peasants call her the goddess of gloom
she speaks good english
and she invites you up into her room
and you're so kind
and careful not to go to her too soon
and she takes your voice
and leaves you howling at the moon


up on housing project hill
it's either fortune or fame
you must pick one or the other
though neither of them are to be what they claim
if you're lookin' to get silly
you better go back to from where you came
because the cops don't need you
and man, they expect the same


now all the authorities
they just stand around and boast
how they blackmailed the sergeant-at-arms
into leaving his post
and picking up angel
who just arrived here from the coast
who looked so fine at first
but left lookin' just like a ghost


i started out on burgundy
but soon hit the harder stuff
everybody said they'd stand behind me
when the game got rough
but the joke was on me
there was nobody even there to call my bluff
i'm going back to new york city
i do believe i've had enough

once upon a time you dressed so fine
threw the bums a dime in your prime, didn't you?
people call, say "beware doll, you're bound to fall"
you thought they were all a-kiddin' you
you used to laugh about
everybody that was hangin' out
now you don't talk so loud
now you don't seem so proud
about having to be scrounging your next meal


how does it feel?
how does it feel?
to be without a home?
like a complete unknown?
like a rolling stone?


aw, you've gone to the finest school all right, miss lonely
but ya know ya only used to get juiced in it
nobody's ever taught ya how to live out on the street
and now you’re gonna have to get used to it
you say you never compromise
with the mystery tramp, but now you realize
he's not selling any alibis
as you stare into the vacuum of his eyes
and say, “do you want to make a deal?"


how does it feel?
how does it feel?
to be on your own
with no direction home
a complete unknown
like a rolling stone?


aw, you never turned around to see the frowns
on the jugglers and the clowns when they all did tricks for you
never understood that it ain't no good
you shouldn't let other people get your kicks for you
you used to ride on a chrome horse with your diplomat
who carried on his shoulder a siamese cat
ain't it hard when you discover that
he really wasn't where it's at
after he took from you everything he could steal?


how does it feel?
how does it feel?
to hang on your own
with no direction home
like a complete unknown
like a rolling stone?


aw, princess on the steeple and all the pretty people
they're all drinkin', thinkin' that they got it made
exchangin' all precious gifts
but you'd better take your diamond ring, ya better pawn it, babe
you used to be so amused
at napoleon in rags and the language that he used
go to him now, he calls ya, ya can't refuse
when ya ain't got nothin', you got nothin' to lose
you're invisible now, ya got no secrets to conceal

how does it feel?
aw, how does it feel?
to be on your own
with no direction home
like a complete unknown
like a rolling stone?

i ain't gonna work on maggie's farm no more
no, i ain't gonna work on maggie's farm no more
well, i wake up in the morning, fold my hands and pray for rain
i got a head full of ideas that are drivin' me insane
it's a shame the way she makes me scrub the floor
i ain't gonna work on maggie's farm no more


i ain't gonna work for maggie's brother no more
no, i ain't gonna work for maggie's brother no more
well, he hands you a nickel, he hands you a dime
he asks you with a grin if you're having a good time
then he fines you every time you slam the door
i ain't gonna work for maggie's brother no more


i ain't gonna work for maggie's pa no more
no, i ain't gonna work for maggie's pa no more
well, he puts his cigar out in your face just for kicks
his bedroom window, it is made out of bricks
the national guard stands around his door
ah, i ain't gonna work for maggie's pa no more


i ain't gonna work for maggie's ma no more
no, i ain't gonna work for maggie's ma no more
well, she talks to all the servants about man and god and law
everybody says she's the brains behind pa
she's 68, but she says she's 54
i ain't gonna work for maggie's ma no more


i ain't gonna work on maggie's farm no more
i ain't gonna work on maggie's farm no more
well, i try my best to be just like i am
but everybody wants you to be just like them
they say "sing while you slave" and i just get bored
ah, i ain't gonna work on maggie's farm no more

hey, mr. tambourine man, play a song for me
i'm not sleepy, and there is no place i'm going to
hey, mr. tambourine man, play a song for me
in the jingle jangle mornin' i'll come followin' you


though i know that evening's empire has returned into sand
vanished from my hand
left me blindly here to stand, but still not sleeping
my weariness amazes me, i am branded on my feet
i have no one to meet
and my ancient empty street's too dead for dreaming


hey, mr. tambourine man, play a song for me
i'm not sleepy, and there is no place i'm going to
hey, mr. tambourine man, play a song for me
in the jingle jangle mornin' i'll come followin' you


take me on a trip upon your magic swirlin' ship
my senses have been stripped, my hands can't feel to grip
my toes too numb to step, wait only for my boot heels
to be wandering
i'm ready to go anywhere, i'm ready for to fade
into my own parade, cast your dancin' spell my way
i promise to go under it


hey, mr. tambourine man, play a song for me
i'm not sleepy, and there is no place i'm going to
hey, mr. tambourine man, play a song for me
in the jingle jangle mornin' i'll come followin' you


though you might hear laughing, spinning, swinging madly across the sun
it's not aimed at anyone, it's just escaping on the run
and but for the sky there are no fences facing
and if you hear vague traces of skipping reels of rhyme
to your tambourine in time, it's just a ragged clown behind
i wouldn't pay it any mind
it's just a shadow you're seeing that he's chasing


hey, mr. tambourine man, play a song for me
i'm not sleepy, and there is no place i'm going to
hey, mr. tambourine man, play a song for me
in the jingle jangle mornin' i'll come followin' you




and take me disappearing through the smoke rings of my mind
down the foggy ruins of time, far past the frozen leaves
the haunted, frightened trees, out to the windy beach
far from the twisted reach of crazy sorrow
yes, to dance beneath the diamond sky with one hand waving free
silhouetted by the sea, circled by the circus sands
with all memory and fate driven deep beneath the waves
let me forget about today until tomorrow


hey, mr. tambourine man, play a song for me
i'm not sleepy, and there is no place i'm going to
hey, mr. tambourine man, play a song for me
in the jingle jangle mornin' i'll come followin' you

johnny's in the basement, mixin' up the medicine
i'm on the pavement, thinkin' about the government
the man in a trench coat, badge out, laid off
says he's got a bad cough, wants to get it paid off
look out kid, it's somethin' you did
god knows when, but you're doin' it again
you better duck down the alleyway, looking for a new friend
the man in the coon-skin cap in a pig pen
wants 11 dollar bills – you only got 10


maggie comes fleet foot, face full of black soot
talkin' that the heat put plants in the bed, but
phone's tapped anyway
maggie says the many say
they must bust in early may
orders from the d.a
look out kid, don't matter what you did
walk on your tip toes, don’t tie no bows
better stay away from those that carry around a fire hose
keep a clean nose, watch the plainclothes
you don't need a weather man to know which way the wind blows


oh, get sick, get well, hang around a ink well
hang bail, hard to tell if anything is gonna sell
try hard, get barred, get back, ride rail
get jailed, jump bail, join the army if you fail
look out kid, you're gonna get hit
by losers, cheaters, six-time users
hanging 'round the theaters
girl by the whirlpool's looking for a new fool
don't follow leaders, a-watch the parking meters


oh, get born, keep warm
short pants, romance
learn to dance, get dressed
get blessed, try to be a success
please her, please him, buy gifts
don't steal, don't lift
20 years of schoolin' and they put you on the day shift
look out kid, they keep it all hid
better jump down a manhole, light yourself a candle
don't wear sandals, try to avoid the scandals
don't want to be a bum, you better chew gum
the pump don't work 'cause the vandals took the handles

the sweet pretty things are in bed now of course
the city fathers they’re trying to endorse
the reincarnation of paul revere’s horse
but the town has no need to be nervous
the ghost of belle starr she hands down her wits
to jezebel the nun she violently knits
a bald wig for jack the ripper who sits
at the head of the chamber of commerce


mama’s in the factory
she ain't got no shoes
daddy’s in the alley
he’s lookin' for food
i am in the kitchen
with the tombstone blues


the hysterical bride in the penny arcade
screaming she moans, “i’ve just been made”
then sends out for the doctor who pulls down the shade
and says, “my advice is to not let the boys in”
now the medicine man comes and he shuffles inside
he walks with a swagger and he says to the bride
“stop all this weeping, swallow your pride
you will not die, it’s not poison”


mama’s in the factory
she ain't got no shoes

well, john the baptist, after torturing a thief
looks up at his hero, the commander-in-chief
saying, “tell me, great hero, but please make it brief
is there a hole for me to get sick in?”
the commander-in-chief answers him while chasing a fly
saying, "death to all those who would whimper and cry"
and dropping a barbell, he points to the sky
saying, "the sun’s not yellow, it’s chicken"


mama’s in the factory
she ain't got no shoes
daddy’s in the alley
he’s lookin' for food
i am in the kitchen

the king of the philistines his soldiers to save
puts jawbones on their tombstones and flatters their graves
puts the pied pipers in prison and fattens the slaves
then sends them out to the jungle
gypsy davey with a blowtorch he burns out their camps
with his faithful slave pedro behind him he tramps
with a fantastic collection of stamps
to win friends and influence his uncle


mama’s in the factory
she ain't got no shoes
daddy’s in the alley
he’s lookin' for food
i’m in trouble
with the tombstone blues


the geometry of innocent flesh on the bone
causes galileo’s math book to get thrown
at delilah who's sitting worthlessly alone
but the tears on her cheeks are from laughter
now i wish i could give brother bill his great thrill
i would set him in chains at the top of the hill
then send out for some pillars and cecil b. demille
he could die happily ever after


mama’s in the factory
she ain't got no shoes
daddy’s in the alley
he’s lookin' for food
i am in the kitchen
with the tombstone blues


where ma rainey and beethoven once unwrapped their bedroll
tuba players now rehearse around the flagpole
and the national bank at a profit sells road maps for the soul
to the old folks home and the college
now i wish i could write you a melody so plain
that could hold you dear lady from going insane
that could ease you and cool you and cease the pain
of your useless and pointless knowledge


mama’s in the factory
she ain't got no shoes
daddy’s in the alley
he’s lookin' for food
i am in the kitchen
with the tombstone blues
