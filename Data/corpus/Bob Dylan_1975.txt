someone’s got it in for me
they’re planting stories in the press
whoever it is i wish they’d cut it out quick
but when they will i can only guess
they say i shot a man named gray
and took his wife to italy
she inherited a million bucks
and when she died it came to me
i can’t help it if i’m lucky


people see me all the time
and they just can’t remember how to act
their minds are filled with big ideas
images and distorted facts
even you, yesterday
you had to ask me where it was at
i couldn’t believe after all these years
you didn’t know me any better than that
sweet lady


idiot wind
blowing every time you move your mouth
blowing down the backroads heading south
idiot wind
blowing every time you move your teeth
you’re an idiot, babe
it’s a wonder that you still know how to breathe


i ran into the fortune-teller
who said beware of lightning that might strike
i haven’t known peace and quiet
for so long, i can’t remember what it’s like
there’s a lone soldier on the cross
smoke pouring out of a boxcar door
you didn’t know it, you didn’t think it could be done
in the final end he won the war
after losing every battle


i woke up on the roadside
daydreaming about the way things sometimes are
visions of your chestnut mare
shoot through my head and are making me see stars
you hurt the ones that i love best
and cover up the truth with lies
one day you’ll be in the ditch
flies buzzing around your eyes
blood on your saddle


idiot wind
blowing through the flowers on your tomb
blowing through the curtains in your room
idiot wind
blowing every time you move your teeth
you’re an idiot, babe
it’s a wonder that you still know how to breathe


it was gravity which pulled us down
and destiny which broke us apart
you tamed the lion in my cage
but it just wasn’t enough to change my heart
now everything’s a little upside down
as a matter of fact, the wheels have stopped
what’s good is bad, what’s bad is good
you’ll find out when you reach the top
you’re on the bottom


i noticed at the ceremony
your corrupt ways had finally made you blind
i can’t remember your face anymore
your mouth has changed, your eyes don’t look into mine
the priest wore black on the seventh day
and sat stone-faced while the building burned
i waited for you on the running boards
near the cypress trees, while the springtime turned
slowly into autumn


idiot wind
blowing like a circle around my skull
from the grand coulee dam to the capitol
idiot wind
blowing every time you move your teeth
you’re an idiot, babe
it’s a wonder that you still know how to breathe


i can’t feel you anymore
i can’t even touch the books you’ve read
every time i crawl past your door
i been wishing i've been somebody else instead
down the highway, down the tracks
down the road to ecstasy
i followed you beneath the stars
hounded by your memory
and all your raging glory


i been double-crossed now
for the very last time and now i’m finally free
i kissed goodbye the howling beast
on the borderline which separated you from me
you’ll never know the hurt i suffered
nor the pain i rise above
and i’ll never know the same about you
your holiness or your kind of love
and it makes me feel so sorry


idiot wind
blowing through the buttons of our coats
blowing through the letters that we wrote
idiot wind
blowing through the dust upon our shelves
we’re idiots, babe
it’s a wonder we can even feed ourselves

the festival was over, and the boys were all planning for a fall
the cabaret was quiet except for the drilling in the wall
the curfew had been lifted and the gambling wheel shut down
anyone with any sense had already left town
he was standing in the doorway looking like the jack of hearts


he moved across the mirrored room, “set it up for everyone,” he said
then everyone commenced to do what they were doing before he turned their heads
then he walked up to a stranger and he asked him with a grin
“could you kindly tell me, friend, what time the show begins?”
then he moved into the corner, face down like the jack of hearts


backstage the girls were playing five-card stud by the stairs
lily had two queens, she was hoping for a third to match her pair
outside the streets were filling up, the window was open wide
a gentle breeze was blowing, you could feel it from inside
lily called another bet and drew up the jack of hearts


big jim was no one’s fool, he owned the town's only diamond mine
he made his usual entrance looking so dandy and so fine
with his bodyguards and silver cane and every hair in place
he took whatever he wanted to and he laid it all to waste
but his bodyguards and silver cane were no match for the jack of hearts


rosemary combed her hair and took a carriage into town
she slipped in through the side door looking like a queen without a crown
she fluttered her false eyelashes and whispered in his ear
“sorry, darling, that i’m late,” but he didn't seem to hear
he was staring into space over at the jack of hearts


“i know i’ve seen that face somewhere,” big jim was thinking to himself
“maybe down in mexico or a picture up on somebody’s shelf”
but then the crowd began to stamp their feet and the house lights did dim
and in the darkness of the room there was only jim and him
staring at the butterfly who just drew the jack of hearts


lily was a princess, she was fair-skinned and precious as a child
she did whatever she had to do, she had that certain flash every time she smiled
she had come away from a broken home, had lots of strange affairs
with men in every walk of life which took her everywhere
but she’d never met anyone quite like the jack of hearts


the hanging judge came in unnoticed and was being wined and dined
the drilling in the wall kept up but no one seemed to pay it any mind
it was known all around that lily had jim’s ring
and nothing would ever come between lily and the king
no, nothing ever would except maybe the jack of hearts


rosemary started drinking hard and seeing her reflection in the knife
she was tired of the attention, tired of playing the role of big jim’s wife
she had done a lot of bad things, even once tried suicide
was looking to do just one good deed before she died
she was gazing to the future, riding on the jack of hearts


lily took her dress off, buried it away
“has your luck run out?” she laughed at him, “well, i guess you must
have known it would someday
be careful not to touch the wall, there’s a brand-new coat of paint
i’m glad to see you’re still alive, you’re looking like a saint”
down the hallway footsteps were coming for the jack of hearts


the backstage manager was pacing all around by his chair
“there’s something funny going on,” he said, “i can just feel it in the air”
he went to get the hanging judge, but the hanging judge was drunk
as the leading actor hurried by in the costume of a monk
there was no actor anywhere better than the jack of hearts


no one knew the circumstance but they say that it happened pretty quick
the door to the dressing room burst open and a colt revolver clicked
and big jim was standing there, ya couldn't say surprised
rosemary right beside him, steady in her eyes
she was with big jim but she was leaning to the jack of hearts


two doors down the boys finally made it through the wall
and cleaned out the bank safe, it’s said that they got off with quite a haul
in the darkness by the riverbed they waited on the ground
for one more member who had business back in town
but they couldn't go no further without the jack of hearts


the next day was hanging day, the sky was overcast and black
big jim lay covered up, killed by a penknife in the back
and rosemary on the gallows, she didn't even blink
the hanging judge was sober, he hadn't had a drink
the only person on the scene missing was the jack of hearts


the cabaret was empty now, a sign said, “closed for repair”
lily had already taken all of the dye out of her hair
she was thinking ’bout her father, who she very rarely saw
thinking ’bout rosemary and thinking about the law
but most of all she was thinking ’bout the jack of hearts

'twas in another lifetime
one of toil and blood
when blackness was a virtue
the road was full of mud
i came in from the wilderness
a creature void of form
"come in," she said, "i'll give ya
shelter from the storm"


and if i pass this way again
you can rest assured
i'll always do my best for her
on that i give my word
in a world of steel-eyed death and men
who are fighting to be warm
"come in," she said, "i'll give ya
shelter from the storm"


not a word was spoke between us
there was little risk involved
everything up to that point
had been left unresolved
try imagining a place
where it's always safe and warm
"come in," she said, "i'll give ya
shelter from the storm"


i was burned out from exhaustion
buried in the hail
poisoned in the bushes
and blown out on the trail
hunted like a crocodile
ravaged in the corn
"come in," she said, "i'll give ya
shelter from the storm"


suddenly i turned around
and she was standing there
with silver bracelets on her wrists
and flowers in her hair
she walked up to me so gracefully
and took my crown of thorns
"come in," she said, "i'll give ya
shelter from the storm"


now there's a wall between us
something there's been lost
i took too much for granted
i got my signals crossed
just to think that it all began
on an uneventful morn
"come in," she said, "i'll give ya
shelter from the storm"


well, the deputy walks on hard nails
and the preacher rides a mount
but nothing really matters much
it's doom alone that counts
and the one-eyed undertaker
he blows a futile horn
"come in," she said, "i'll give ya
shelter from the storm


i've heard newborn babies wailing
like a mourning dove
and old men with broken teeth
stranded without love
do i understand your question, then
is it hopeless and forlorn
"come in," she said, "i'll give ya
shelter from the storm"


in a little hilltop village
they gambled for my clothes
i bargained for salvation
and she gave me a lethal dose
i offered up my innocence
and i got repaid with scorn
"come in," she said, "i'll give ya
shelter from the storm"


well, i'm living in a foreign country
but i'm bound to cross the line
beauty walks a razor's edge
someday i'll make it mine
if i could only turn back the clock
to when god and her were born
"come in," she said, "i'll give ya
shelter from the storm"

early one morning the sun was shining
i was laying in bed
wondering if she'd changed at all
if her hair was still red
her folks they said our lives together
sure was going to be rough
they never did like mama's homemade dress
papa's bankbook wasn't big enough
and i was standing on the side of the road
rain falling on my shoes
heading out for the east coast
lord knows i've paid some dues
getting through
tangled up in blue


she was married when we first met
soon to be divorced
i helped her out of a jam, i guess
but i used a little too much force
we drove that car as far as we could
abandoned it out west
split up on a dark sad night
both agreeing it was best
she turned around to look at me
as i was walking away
i heard her say over my shoulder
"we'll meet again someday
on the avenue"
tangled up in blue


i had a job in the great north woods
working as a cook for a spell
but i never did like it all that much
and one day the ax just fell
so i drifted down to new orleans
where i lucky was to be employed
working for a while on a fishing boat
right outside of delacroix
but all the while i was alone
the past was close behind
i seen a lot of women
but she never escaped my mind
and i just grew
tangled up in blue


she was working in a topless place
and i stopped in for a beer
i just kept looking at the side of her face
in the spotlight, so clear
and later on, when the crowd thinned out
i was just about to do the same
she was standing there, in back of my chair
said, "tell me, don't i know your name?"
i muttered something underneath my breath
she studied the lines on my face
i must admit, i felt a little uneasy
when she bent down to tie the laces
of my shoe
tangled up in blue


she lit a burner on the stove
and offered me a pipe
"i thought you'd never say hello," she said
"you look like the silent type"
then she opened up a book of poems
and handed it to me
written by an italian poet
from the thirteenth century
and every one of them words rang true
and glowed like burning coal
pouring off of every page
like it was written in my soul
from me to you
tangled up in blue


i lived with them on montague street
in a basement down the stairs
there was music in the cafes at night
and revolution in the air
then he started into dealing with slaves
and something inside of him died
she had to sell everything she owned
and froze up inside
and when it finally, the bottom fell out
i became withdrawn
the only thing i knew how to do
was to keep on keeping on
like a bird that flew
tangled up in blue


so now i'm going back again
i got to get to her somehow
all the people we used to know
they're an illusion to me now
some are mathematicians
some are carpenter's wives
don't know how it all got started
i don't know what they're doing with their lives
but me, i'm still on the road
a-heading for another joint
we always did feel the same
we just saw it from a different point
of view
tangled up in blue

i’ve seen love go by my door
it’s never been this close before
never been so easy or so slow
i've been shooting in the dark too long
when something’s not right, it’s wrong
you're gonna make me lonesome when you go


dragon clouds so high above
i’ve only known careless love
it always just hit me from below
but this time 'round it’s more correct
right on target, so direct
you're gonna make me lonesome when you go


purple clover, queen anne's lace
crimson hair across your face
you could make me cry, if you don’t know
can’t remember what i was thinking of
you might be spoilin’ me too much love
you're gonna make me lonesome when you go


flowers on the hillside blooming crazy
crickets talking back and forth in rhyme
blue river running slow and lazy
i could stay with you forever and never realize the time


situations have ended sad
relationships have all been bad
mine’ve been like verlaine’s and rimbaud
but there’s no way i can compare
all them scenes to this affair
you're gonna make me lonesome when you go


you're gonna make me wonder what i’m doin’
staying far behind without you
you're gonna make me wonder what i’m sayin’
you're gonna make me give myself a good talking-to


i’ll look for you in old honolulu
san francisco or ashtabula
you're gonna have to leave me now, i know
but i’ll see you in the sky above
in the tall grass, in the ones i love
you're gonna make me lonesome when you go
