up on the white veranda
she wears a necktie and a panama hat
her passport shows a face
from another time and place
she looks nothing like that
and all the remnants of her recent past
are scattered in the wild wind
she walks across the marble floor
where a voice from the gambling room is calling her to come on in
she smiles, walks the other way
as the last ship sails and the moon fades away
from black diamond bay


as the morning light breaks open, the greek comes down
and he asks for a rope and a pen that will write
“pardon, monsieur,” the desk clerk says
carefully removes his fez
“am i hearing you right?”
and as the yellow fog is lifting
the greek is quickly heading for the second floor
she passes him on the spiral staircase
thinking he’s the soviet ambassador
she starts to speak, but he walks away
as the storm clouds rise and the palm branches sway
on black diamond bay


a soldier sits beneath the fan
doing business with a tiny man who sells him a ring
lightning strikes, the lights blow out
the desk clerk wakes and begins to shout
“can you see anything?”
then the greek appears on the second floor
in his bare feet with a rope around his neck
while a loser in the gambling room lights up a candle
says, “open up another deck”
but the dealer says, “attendez-vous, s’il vous plait”
as the rain beats down and the cranes fly away
from black diamond bay


the desk clerk heard the woman laugh
as he looked around the aftermath and the soldier got tough
he tried to grab the woman’s hand
said, “here’s a ring, it cost a grand”
she said, “that ain't enough”
then she ran upstairs to pack her bags
while a horse-drawn taxi waited at the curb
she passed the door that the greek had locked
where a handwritten sign read, “do not disturb”
she knocked upon it anyway
as the sun went down and the music did play
on black diamond bay


“i’ve got to talk to someone quick!”
but the greek said, “go away,” and he kicked the chair to the floor
he hung there from the chandelier
she cried, “help, there’s danger near
please open up the door!”
then the volcano erupted
and the lava flowed down from the mountain high above
the soldier and the tiny man were crouched in the corner
thinking of forbidden love
but the desk clerk said, “it happens every day”
as the stars fell down and the fields burned away
on black diamond bay


as the island slowly sank
the loser finally broke the bank in the gambling room
the dealer said, “it’s too late now
you can take your money, but i don’t know how
you’ll spend it in the tomb”
the tiny man bit the soldier’s ear
as the floor caved in and the boiler in the basement blew
while she’s out on the balcony, where a stranger tells her
“my darling, je vous aime beaucoup”
she sheds a tear and then begins to pray
as the fire burns on and the smoke drifts away
from black diamond bay


i was sitting home alone one night in l.a
watching old cronkite on the seven o’clock news
it seems there was an earthquake that
left nothing but a panama hat
and a pair of old greek shoes
didn’t seem like much was happening
so i turned it off and went to grab another beer
seems like every time you turn around
there’s another hard-luck story that you’re going to hear
and there’s really nothing anyone can say
and i never did plan to go anyway
to black diamond bay

pistol shots ring out in the barroom night
enter patty valentine from the upper hall
she sees the bartender in a pool of blood
cries out, “my god, they killed them all!”


here comes the story of the hurricane
the man the authorities came to blame
for something that he never done
put in a prison cell, but one time he could-a been
the champion of the world


three bodies lyin' there, does patty see
and another man named bello, moving around mysteriously
“i didn’t do it,” he says, and he throws up his hands
“i was only robbin' the register, i hope you understand


i saw them leaving,” he says, and he stops
“one of us had better call up the cops”
and so patty calls the cops, and they arrive on the scene
with their red lights flashin' in the hot new jersey night


meanwhile, far away in another part of town
rubin carter and a couple of friends are drivin' around
number one contender for the middleweight crown
had no idea what kinda shit was about to go down


when a cop pulled him over to the side of the road
just like the time before and the time before that
in paterson that’s just the way things go
if you’re black, you might as well not show up on the street
unless you want to draw the heat


alfred bello had a partner and he had a rap for the cops
him and arthur dexter bradley were just out prowling around
he said, “i saw two men running out, they looked like middleweights
they jumped into a white car with out-of-state plates”


and miss patty valentine just nodded her head
cop said, “wait a minute, boys, this one’s not dead”
so they took him to the infirmary
and though this man could hardly see
they told him he could identify the guilty men


four in the morning and they haul rubin in
they take him to the hospital and they brought him upstairs
the wounded man looks up through his one dying eye
say, “why did you bring him in here for? he ain't the guy!”


here’s the story of the hurricane
the man the authorities came to blame
for something that he never done
put in a prison cell, but one time he could-a been
the champion of the world


four months later, the ghettos are in flame
rubin’s in south america, fighting for his name
while arthur dexter bradley’s still in the robbery game
and the cops are putting the screws to him
lookin' for somebody to blame


“remember that murder that happened in a bar?”
“remember you said you saw the getaway car?”
“you think you’d like to play ball with the law?”
“think it might-a been that fighter that you saw
running that night?”
“don’t forget that you are white”


arthur dexter bradley said, “i’m really not sure”
the cops said, “a poor boy like you could use a break
we got you for the motel job, and we’re talking to your friend bello
now you don’t want to have to go back to jail, be a nice fellow


you’ll be doing society a favor
that son of a bitch is brave and gettin' braver
we want to put his ass in stir
we want to pin this triple murder
on him
he ain’t no gentleman jim”


rubin could take a man out with just one punch
but he never did like to talk about it all that much
"it’s my work", he’d say, "and i do it for pay"
"and when it’s over i’d just as soon go on my way"


up to some paradise
where the trout streams flow and the air is nice
and ride a horse along a trail
but then they took him to the jailhouse
where they try to turn a man into a mouse


all of rubin’s cards were marked in advance
the trial was a pig-circus, he never had a chance
the judge made rubin’s witnesses drunkards from the slums
to the white folks who watched he was a revolutionary bum


and to the black folks he was just a crazy nigga
no one doubted that he pulled the trigger
and though they could not produce the gun
the d.a. said he was the one who did the deed
and the all-white jury agreed


rubin carter was falsely tried
the crime was murder “one”, guess who testified?
bello and bradley and they both baldly lied
and the newspapers, they all went along for the ride


how can the life of such a man
be in the palm of some fool’s hand?
to see him obviously framed
couldn’t help but make me feel ashamed
to live in a land where justice is a game


now all the criminals in their coats and their ties
are free to drink martinis, and watch the sun rise
while rubin sits like buddha in a ten-foot cell
an innocent man in a living hell


yes that’s the story of the hurricane
but it won’t be over till they clear his name
and give him back the time he’s done
put in a prison cell, but one time he could-a been
the champion of the world

i married isis on the fifth day of may
but i could not hold on to her very long
so i cut off my hair and i rode straight away
for the wild unknown country where i could not go wrong


i came to a high place of darkness and light
dividing line ran through the center of town
i hitched up my pony to a post on the right
went in to a laundry to wash my clothes down


a man in the corner approached me for a match
i knew right away, he was not ordinary
he said “are you looking for something easy to catch?”
said “i got no money”
he said “that ain't necessary”


we set out that night, for the cold in the north
i gave him my blanket, and he gave me his word
i said “where are we going?” he said we’d be back by the fourth
i said “that’s the best news that i’ve ever heard”


i was thinking about turquoise, i was thinking about gold
i was thinking about diamonds, and the world’s biggest necklace
as we rode through the canyons, through the devilish cold
i was thinking about isis, how she thought i was so reckless


how she told me that one day we would meet up again
and things would be different the next time we wed
if i only could hang on and just be her friend
i still can’t remember all the best things she said


we came to the pyramids, all embedded in ice
he said “there’s a body i’m trying to find
if i carry it out it’ll bring a good price”
'twas then that i knew what he had on his mind


the wind it was a-howlin', and the snow was outrageous
we chopped through the night
and we chopped through the dawn
when he died, i was hopin' that it wasn’t contagious
but i made up my mind that i had to go on


i broke into the tomb, but the casket was empty
there was no jewels, no nothing! i felt i’d been had
when i saw that my partner was just being friendly
when i took up his offer i must have been mad


i picked up his body and i dragged him inside
threw him down in the hole, and i put back the cover
i said a quick prayer, then i felt satisfied
then i rode back to find isis, just to tell her i love her


she was there, in the meadow, where the creek used to rise
blinded by sleep, and in need of a bed
i came in from the east, with the sun in my eyes
i cursed her one time, then i rode on ahead


she said “where you been?”
i said “no place special”
she said “you look different”
i said “well... i guess”
she said “you been gone”
i said “that’s only natural”
she said “you going to stay?”
i said “if you want me to, yes"


isis, oh, isis, you mystical child
what drives me to you is what drives me insane
i still can remember the way that you smiled
on the fifth day of may in the drizzling rain

born in red hook, brooklyn, in the year of who knows when
opened up his eyes to the tune of an accordion
always on the outside of whatever side there was
when they asked him why it had to be that way, “well,” he answered
“just because”

larry was the oldest, joey was next to last
they called joe “crazy,” the baby they called “kid blast”
some say they lived off gambling and runnin’ numbers too
it always seemed they got caught between the mob and the men in blue


joey, joey
king of the streets, child of clay
joey, joey
what made them want to come and blow you away?


there was talk they killed their rivals, but the truth was far from that
no one ever knew for sure where they were really at
when they tried to strangle larry, joey almost hit the roof
he went out that night to seek revenge, thinking he was bulletproof

the war broke out at the break of dawn, it emptied out the streets
joey and his brothers suffered terrible defeats
till they ventured out behind the lines and took five prisoners
they stashed them away in a basement, called them amateurs

the hostages were trembling when they heard a man exclaim
“let’s blow this place to kingdom come, let con edison take the blame”
but joey stepped up, and he raised his hands, said, “we’re not those kind of men
it’s peace and quiet that we need to go back to work again”


joey, joey
king of the streets, child of clay
joey, joey
what made them want to come and blow you away?


the police department hounded him, they called him mr. smith
they got him on conspiracy, they were never sure who with
“what time is it?” said the judge to joey when they met
“five to ten,” said joey. the judge says, “that’s exactly what you get”
he did ten years in attica, reading nietzsche and wilhelm reich
they threw him in the hole one time for trying to stop a strike
his closest friends were black men because they seemed to understand
what it’s like to be in society with a shackle on your hand
when they let him out in ’71 he’d lost a little weight
but he dressed like jimmy cagney and i swear he did look great
he tried to find the way back into the life he left behind
to the boss he said, “i have returned and now i want what’s mine”


joey, joey
king of the streets, child of clay
joey, joey
what made them want to come and blow you away?


it was true that in his later years he would not carry a gun
“i’m around too many children,” he’d say, “they should never know of one”
yet he walked right into the clubhouse of his lifelong deadly foe
emptied out the register, said, “tell them it was crazy joe”
one day they blew him down in a clam bar in new york
he could see it coming through the door as he lifted up his fork
he pushed the table over to protect his family
then he staggered out into the streets of little italy


joey, joey
king of the streets, child of clay
joey, joey
what made them want to come and blow you away?


sister jacqueline and carmela and mother mary all did weep
i heard his best friend frankie say, “he is not dead, he’s just asleep”
then i saw the old man’s limousine head back towards the grave
i guess he had to say one last goodbye to the son that he could not save

the sun turned cold over president street and the town of brooklyn mourned
they said a mass in the old church near the house where he was born
and someday if god’s in heaven overlooking his preserve
i know the men that shot him down will get what they deserve


joey, joey
king of the streets, child of clay
joey, joey
what made them want to come and blow you away?

hot chili peppers in the blistering sun
dust on my face and my cape
me and magdalena on the run
i think this time we shall escape

sold my guitar to the baker’s son
for a few crumbs and a place to hide
but i can get another one
and i’ll play for magdalena as we ride


no ilores, mi querida
dios nos vigila
soon the horse will take us to durango
agarrame, mi vida
soon the desert will be gone
soon you will be dancing the fandango


past the aztec ruins and the ghosts of our people
hoof beats like castanets on stone
at night i dream of bells in the village steeple
then i see the bloody face of ramon

was it me that shot him down in the cantina
was it my hand that held the gun?
come, let us fly, my magdalena
the dogs are barking and what’s done is done


no ilores, mi querida
dios nos vigila
soon the horse will take us to durango
agarrame, mi vida
soon the desert will be gone
soon you will be dancing the fandango


in the corrida we’ll sit in the shade
and watch the young torero stand alone
we’ll drink tequila where our grandfathers stayed
when they rode with villa into torreón

then the padre will recite the prayers of old
in the little church this side of town
i will wear new boots and an earring of gold
you’ll shine with diamonds in your wedding gown

the way is long but the end is near
already the fiesta has begun
the face of god will appear
with his serpent eyes of obsidian


no ilores, mi querida
dios nos vigila
soon the horse will take us to durango
agarrame, mi vida
soon the desert will be gone
soon you will be dancing the fandango


was that the thunder that i heard?
my head is vibrating, i feel a sharp pain
come sit by me, don’t say a word
oh, can it be that i am slain?

quick, magdalena, take my gun
look up in the hills, that flash of light
aim well my little one
we may not make it through the night


no ilores, mi querida
dios nos vigila
soon the horse will take us to durango
agarrame, mi vida
soon the desert will be gone
soon you will be dancing the fandango

i laid on a dune, i looked at the sky
when the children were babies and played on the beach
you came up behind me, i saw you go by
you were always so close and still within reach


sara, sara
whatever made you want to change your mind?
sara, sara
so easy to look at, so hard to define


i can still see them playing with their pails in the sand
they run to the water their buckets to fill
i can still see the shells falling out of their hands
as they follow each other back up the hill


sara, sara
sweet virgin angel, sweet love of my life
sara, sara
radiant jewel, mystical wife

sleeping in the woods by a fire in the night
drinking white rum in a portugal bar
them playing leapfrog and hearing about snow white
you in the marketplace in savanna-la-mar


sara, oh sara
it’s all so clear, i could never forget
sara, oh sara
loving you is the one thing i’ll never regret


i can still hear the sounds of those methodist bells
i’d taken the cure and had just gotten through
staying up for days in the chelsea hotel
writing “sad eyed lady of the lowlands” for you


sara, sara
wherever we travel we’re never apart
sara, oh sara
beautiful lady, so dear to my heart


how did i meet you? i don’t know
a messenger sent me in a tropical storm
you were there in the winter, moonlight on the snow
and on lily pond lane when the weather was warm


sara, oh sara
scorpio sphinx in a calico dress
sara, oh sara
you must forgive me my unworthiness


now the beach is deserted except for some kelp
and a piece of an old ship that lies on the shore
you always responded when i needed your help
you give me a map and a key to your door


sara, oh sara
glamorous nymph with an arrow and bow
sara, oh sara
don’t ever leave me, don’t ever go
