just a minute 'fore you leave, girl
just a minute 'fore you touch the door
what is it that you’re trying to achieve, girl?
do you think we can talk about it some more?
you know, the streets are filled with vipers
who’ve lost all ray of hope
you know, it's not even safe no more
in the palace of the pope

don’t fall apart on me tonight
i just don’t think that i could handle it
don’t fall apart on me tonight
yesterday’s just a memory
tomorrow is never what it’s supposed to be
and i need you, yeah


come over here from over there, girl
sit down here, you can have my chair
i can’t see us goin' anywhere, girl
the only place open is a thousand miles away
and i can’t take you there
i wished i’d have been a doctor
maybe i’d have saved some life that've been lost
maybe i’d have done some good in the world
instead of burning every bridge i crossed


don’t fall apart on me tonight
i just don’t think that i could handle it
don’t fall apart on me tonight
yesterday’s just a memory
tomorrow's never what it’s supposed to be
and i need you, ah, yeah


i ain't too good at conversation, girl
so you might not know exactly how i feel
but if i could i’d bring you to the mountain top, girl
and build you a house made out of stainless steel
but it’s like i’m stuck inside a painting
that’s a-hanging in the louvre
my throat starts to tickle and my nose itches
but i know that i can’t move


don’t fall apart on me tonight
i just don’t think that i could handle it
don’t fall apart on me tonight
yesterday’s gone but the past live' on
tomorrow's just one step beyond
and i need you, ah


who are these people that are walking towards you?
do you know them or will there be a fight?
with their humorless smiles so easy to see through
can they tell you what’s wrong from what’s right?
oh, do you remember st. james street
where you blew jackie p.’s mind?
you were so fine, clark gable would have fell at your feet
and laid his life on the line

let’s try to get beneath the surface waste, girl
no more booby traps and bombs
no more decadence and charms
no more affection that’s misplaced, girl
no more mudcake creatures lying in your arms
what about that millionaire
with the drumsticks in his pants?
he looked so baffled and so bewildered
when he played and we didn’t dance


don’t fall apart on me tonight
i just don’t think that i could handle it
don’t fall apart on me tonight
yesterday is just a memory
tomorrow's never what it’s supposed to be
and i need you
yeah, you, ah
i need you

been so long since a strange woman has slept in my bed
look how sweet she sleeps, how free must be her dreams
in another lifetime she must have owned the world, or been faithfully wed
to some righteous king who wrote psalms beside moonlit streams


i and i
in creation where one’s nature neither honors nor forgives
i and i
one says to the other, no man sees my face and lives


think i’ll go out and go for a walk
not much happening here, nothing ever does
besides, if she wakes up now, she’ll just want me to talk
i got nothing to say, specially about whatever was


i and i
in creation where one’s nature neither honors nor forgives
i and i
one says to the other, no man sees my face and lives


took an untrodden path once, where the swift don’t win the race
it goes to the worthy, who can divide the word of truth
took a stranger to teach me, to look into justice’s beautiful face
and to see an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth


i and i
in creation where one’s nature neither honors nor forgives
i and i
one says to the other, no man sees my face and lives


outside of two men on a train platform there’s nobody in sight
they’re waiting for spring to come, smoking down the track
the world could come to an end tonight, but that’s all right
she should still be there sleepin’ when i get back


i and i
in creation where one’s nature neither honors nor forgives
i and i
one says to the other, no man sees my face and lives


noontime, and i’m still pushing myself along the road, the darkest part
into the narrow lanes, i can’t stumble or stay put
someone else is speaking with my mouth, but i’m listening only to my heart
i’ve made shoes for everyone, even you, while i still go barefoot


i and i
in creation where one’s nature neither honors nor forgives
i and i
one says to the other, no man sees my face and lives



standing on the waters casting your bread
while the eyes of the idol with the iron head are glowing
distant ships sailing into the mist
you were born with a snake in both of your fists while a hurricane was blowing
freedom just around the corner for you
but with the truth so far off, what good will it do?


jokerman dance to the nightingale tune
bird fly high by the light of the moon
oh, oh, oh, jokerman


so swiftly the sun sets in the sky
you rise up and say goodbye to no one
fools rush in where angels fear to tread
both of their futures, so full of dread, you don't show one
shedding off one more layer of skin
keeping one step ahead of the persecutor within


jokerman dance to the nightingale tune
bird fly high by the light of the moon
oh, oh, oh, jokerman


you're a man of the mountains, you can walk on the clouds
manipulator of crowds, you're a dream twister
you're going to sodom and gomorrah
but what do you care? ain't nobody there would want to marry your sister
friend to the martyr, a friend to the woman of shame
you look into the fiery furnace, see the rich man without any name


jokerman dance to the nightingale tune
bird fly high by the light of the moon
oh, oh, oh, jokerman


well, the book of leviticus and deuteronomy
the law of the jungle and the sea are your only teachers
in the smoke of the twilight on a milk-white steed
michelangelo indeed could've carved out your features
resting in the fields, far from the turbulent space
half asleep near the stars with a small dog licking your face


jokerman dance to the nightingale tune
bird fly high by the light of the moon
oh, oh, oh, jokerman


well, the rifleman's stalking the sick and the lame
preacherman seeks the same, who'll get there first is uncertain
nightsticks and water cannons, tear gas, padlocks
molotov cocktails and rocks behind every curtain
false-hearted judges dying in the webs that they spin
only a matter of time till night comes stepping in


jokerman dance to the nightingale tune
bird fly high by the light of the moon
oh, oh, oh, jokerman

it's a shadowy world, skies are slippery grey
a woman just gave birth to a prince today and dressed him in scarlet
he'll put the priest in his pocket, put the blade to the heat
take the motherless children off the street
and place them at the feet of a harlot
oh, jokerman, you know what he wants
oh, jokerman, you don't show any response


jokerman dance to the nightingale tune
bird fly high by the light of the moon
oh, oh, oh, jokerman

look out your window, baby, there’s a scene you’d like to catch
the band is playing “dixie,” a man got his hand outstretched
could be the führer
could be the local priest
you know sometimes satan comes as a man of peace


he got a sweet gift of gab, he got a harmonious tongue
he knows every song of love that ever has been sung
good intentions can be evil
both hands can be full of grease
you know that sometimes satan comes as a man of peace


well, first he’s in the background, then he’s in the front
both eyes are looking like they’re on a rabbit hunt
nobody can see through him
no, not even the chief of police
you know that sometimes satan comes as a man of peace


well, he catch you when you’re hoping for a glimpse of the sun
catch you when your troubles feel like they weigh a ton
he could be standing next to you
the person that you’d notice least
i hear that sometimes satan comes as a man of peace


well, he can be fascinating, he can be dull
he can ride down niagara falls in the barrels of your skull
i can smell something cooking
i can tell there’s going to be a feast
you know that sometimes satan comes as a man of peace


he’s a great humanitarian, he’s a great philanthropist
he knows just where to touch you, honey, and how you like to be kissed
he’ll put both his arms around you
you can feel the tender touch of the beast
you know that sometimes satan comes as a man of peace


well, the howling wolf will howl tonight, the king snake will crawl
trees that’ve stood for a thousand years suddenly will fall
want to get married? do it now
tomorrow all activity will cease
you know that sometimes satan comes as a man of peace


somewhere mama’s weeping for her blue-eyed boy
she’s holding them little white shoes and that little broken toy
and he’s following a star
the same one them three men followed from the east
i hear that sometimes satan comes as a man of peace

well, the neighborhood bully, he’s just one man
his enemies say he’s on their land
they got him outnumbered about a million to one
he got no place to escape to, no place to run
he’s the neighborhood bully


the neighborhood bully just lives to survive
he’s criticized and condemned for being alive
he’s not supposed to fight back, he’s supposed to have thick skin
he’s supposed to lay down and die when his door is kicked in
he’s the neighborhood bully


the neighborhood bully been driven out of every land
he’s wandered the earth an exiled man
seen his family scattered, his people hounded and torn
he’s always on trial for just being born
he’s the neighborhood bully


well, he knocked out a lynch mob, he was criticized
old women condemned him, said he should apologize
then he destroyed a bomb factory, nobody was glad
the bombs were meant for him. he was supposed to feel bad
he’s the neighborhood bully


well, the chances are against it and the odds are slim
that he’ll live by the rules that the world makes for him
because there’s a noose at his neck and a gun at his back
and a license to kill him is given out to every maniac
he’s the neighborhood bully


he got no allies to really speak of
what he gets he must pay for, he don’t get it out of love
he buys obsolete weapons and he won’t be denied
but no one sends flesh and blood to fight by his side
he’s the neighborhood bully


well, he’s surrounded by pacifists who all want peace
they pray for it nightly that the bloodshed must cease
now, they wouldn’t hurt a fly. to hurt one they would weep
they lay and they wait for this bully to fall asleep
he’s the neighborhood bully


every empire that’s enslaved him is gone
egypt and rome, even the great babylon
he’s made a garden of paradise in the desert sand
in bed with nobody, under no one’s command
he’s the neighborhood bully


now his holiest books have been trampled upon
no contract he signed was worth what it was written on
he took the crumbs of the world and he turned it into wealth
took sickness and disease and he turned it into health
he’s the neighborhood bully


what’s anybody indebted to him for?
nothing, they say. he just likes to cause war
pride and prejudice and superstition indeed
they wait for this bully like a dog waits to feed
he’s the neighborhood bully


what has he done to wear so many scars?
does he change the course of rivers? does he pollute the moon and stars?
neighborhood bully, standing on the hill
running out the clock, time standing still
neighborhood bully

well, the pressure’s down, the boss ain't here
he gone north, for a while
they say that vanity got the best of him
but he sure left here in style
by the way, that’s a cute hat
and that smile’s so hard to resist
but what’s a sweetheart like you doing in a dump like this?


you know, i once knew a woman who looked like you
she wanted a whole man, not just a half
she used to call me sweet daddy when i was only a child
you kind of remind me of her when you laugh
in order to deal in this game, got to make the queen disappear
it’s done with a flick of the wrist
what’s a sweetheart like you doing in a dump like this?


you know, a woman like you should be at home
that’s where you belong
watching out for someone who loves you true
who would never do you wrong
just how much abuse will you be able to take?
well, there’s no way to tell by that first kiss
what’s a sweetheart like you doing in a dump like this?


you know you can make a name for yourself
you can hear them tires squeal
you can be known as the most beautiful woman
who ever crawled across cut glass to make a deal


you know, news of you has come down the line
even before you came in the door
they say in your father’s house, there’s many mansions
each one of them got a fireproof floor
snap out of it, baby, people are jealous of you
they smile to your face, but behind your back they hiss
what’s a sweetheart like you doing in a dump like this?


got to be an important person to be in here, honey
got to have done some evil deed
got to have your own harem when you come in the door
got to play your harp until your lips bleed


they say that patriotism is the last refuge
to which a scoundrel clings
steal a little and they throw you in jail
steal a lot and they make you king
there’s only one step down from here, baby
it’s called the land of permanent bliss
what’s a sweetheart like you doing in a dump like this?

well, my shoes, they come from singapore
my flashlight’s from taiwan
my tablecloth’s from malaysia
my belt buckle’s from the amazon
you know, this shirt i wear comes from the philippines
and the car i drive is a chevrolet
it was put together down in argentina
by a guy making thirty cents a day


well, it’s sundown on the union
and what’s made in the u.s.a
sure was a good idea
'til greed got in the way


well, this silk dress is from hong kong
and the pearls are from japan
well, the dog collar’s from india
and the flower pot’s from pakistan
all the furniture, it says “made in brazil”
where a woman, she slaved for sure
bringing home thirty cents a day to a family of twelve
you know, that’s a lot of money to her


well, it’s sundown on the union
and what’s made in the u.s.a
sure was a good idea
'til greed got in the way


well, you know, lots of people complaining that there is no work
i say, “why you say that for
when nothing you got is u. s. made?”
they don’t make nothin’ here no more
you know, capitalism is above the law
it say, “it don’t count ’less it sells”
when it costs too much to build it at home
you just build it cheaper someplace else


well, it’s sundown on the union
and what’s made in the u.s.a
sure was a good idea
'til greed got in the way


well, the job that you used to have
they gave it to somebody down in el salvador
the unions are big business, friend
and they’re going out like a dinosaur
they used to grow food in kansas
now they want to grow it on the moon and eat it raw
i can see the day coming when even your home garden
is going to be against the law


well, it’s sundown on the union
and what’s made in the u.s.a
sure was a good idea
'til greed got in the way


democracy don’t rule the world
you’d better get that in your head
this world is ruled by violence
but i guess that’s better left unsaid
from broadway to the milky way
that’s a lot of territory indeed
and a man’s going to do what he has to do
when he’s got a hungry mouth to feed


well, it’s sundown on the union
and what’s made in the u.s.a
sure was a good idea
'til greed got in the way
