i can see the turning of the key
i’ve been deceived by the clown inside of me
i thought that he was righteous but he’s vain
oh, something’s a-telling me i wear the ball and chain


my patron saint is a-fighting with a ghost
he’s always off somewhere when i need him most
the spanish moon is rising on the hill
but my heart is a-tellin’ me i love ya still


i come back to the town from the flaming moon
i see you in the streets, i begin to swoon
i love to see you dress before the mirror
won’t you let me in your room one time ’fore i finally disappear?


everybody’s wearing a disguise
to hide what they’ve got left behind their eyes
but me, i can’t cover what i am
wherever the children go i’ll follow them


i march in the parade of liberty
but as long as i love you i’m not free
how long must i suffer such abuse
won’t you let me see you smile one time before i turn you loose?


i’ve given up the game, i’ve got to leave
the pot of gold is only make-believe
the treasure can’t be found by men who search
whose gods are dead and whose queens are in the church


we sat in an empty theater and we kissed
i asked ya please to cross me off-a your list
my head tells me it’s time to make a change
but my heart is telling me i love ya but you’re strange


one more time at midnight, near the wall
take off your heavy makeup and your shawl
won’t you descend from the throne, from where you sit?
let me feel your love one more time before i abandon it

sometimes i’m in the mood, i want to leave my lonesome home
and sometimes i’m in the mood, i want to hear my milk cow moan
and sometimes i’m in the mood, i want to hit that highway road
but then again, but then again, i said oh, i said oh, i said
oh babe, i’m in the mood for you


sometimes i’m in the mood, lord, i had my overflowing fill
sometimes i’m in the mood, i’m going to make out my final will
sometimes i’m in the mood, i’m going to head for the walking hill
but then again, but then again, i said oh, i said oh, i said
oh babe, i’m in the mood for you


sometimes i’m in the mood, i want to lay right down and die
sometimes i’m in the mood, i want to climb up to the sky
sometimes i’m in the mood, i’m going to laugh until i cry
but then again, i said again, i said again, i said
oh babe, i’m in the mood for you


sometimes i’m in the mood, i’m going to sleep in my pony’s stall
sometimes i’m in the mood, i ain’t going to do nothing at all
sometimes i’m in the mood, i want to fly like a cannonball
but then again, but then again, i said oh, i said oh, i said
oh babe, i’m in the mood for you


sometimes i’m in the mood, i want to back up against the wall
sometimes i’m in the mood, i want to run till i have to crawl
sometimes i’m in the mood, i ain’t going to do nothing at all
but then again, but then again, i said oh, i said oh, i said
oh babe, i’m in the mood for you


sometimes i’m in the mood, i want to change my house around
sometimes i’m in the mood, i’m going to make a change in this here town
sometimes i’m in the mood, i’m going to change the world around
but then again, but then again, i said oh, i said oh, i said
oh babe, i’m in the mood for you

she was the rose of sharon from paradise lost
from the city of seven hills near the place of the cross
i was playing a show in miami in the theater of divine comedy
told about jesus, told about the rain
she told me about the jungle where her brothers were slain
by a man who had been dying and disappeared so mysteriously


was she a child or an angel? did we go too far
were we sniper bait? did we follow a star?
to a hole in the wall wall to where the long arm of the law can not reach?
could i been used and played as a pawn?
it certainly was possible as the gay night wore on
where men bathed in perfume and practiced the hopes of free speech


and them caribbean winds still blow from nassau to mexico
fanning the flames in the furnace of desire
and them distant ships of liberty on them iron waves so bold and free
bringing everything that’s near to me nearer to the fire


she looked into my soul through the clothes that i wore
she said, “we got a mutual friend over by the door
and you know he’s got our best interest in mind”
he was well connected but her heart was a snare
and she had left him to die in there
there were payments due and he was a little behind


the cry of the peacock, flies buzz my head
ceiling fan broken, there’s a heat in my bed
street band playing “nearer my god to thee”
we met at the steeple where the mission bells ring
she said, “i know what you’re thinking, but there ain’t a thing
you can do about it, so let us just agree to agree”


and them caribbean winds still blow from nassau to mexico
fanning the flames in the furnace of desire
and them distant ships of liberty on them iron waves so bold and free
bringing everything that’s near to me nearer to the fire


atlantic city by the cold grey sea
i hear a voice crying, “daddy,” i always think it’s for me
but it’s only the silence in the buttermilk hills that call
every new messenger brings evil report
’bout armies on the march and time that is short
and famines and earthquakes and hatred written upon walls


would i have married her? i don’t know, i suppose
she had bells in her braids and they hung to her toes
but i kept hearing my name and had to be moving on
i saw screws break loose, saw the devil pound tin
i saw a house in the country being torn from within
i heard my ancestors calling from the land far beyond


and them caribbean winds still blow from nassau to mexico
fanning the flames in the furnace of desire
and them distant ships of liberty on them iron waves so bold and free
bringing everything that’s near to me nearer to the fire

bad news, bad news
come to me where i sleep
turn, turn, turn again
sayin’ one of your friends
is in trouble deep
turn, turn to the rain
and the wind
tell me the trouble
tell once to my ear
turn, turn, turn again
joliet prison
and ninety-nine years
turn, turn to the rain
and the wind


oh what’s the charge
of how this came to be
turn, turn, turn again
manslaughter
in the highest of degrees
turn, turn to the rain
and the wind
i sat down and wrote
the best words i could write
turn, turn, turn again
explaining to the judge
i’d be there on wednesday night
turn, turn to the rain
and the wind


without a reply
i left by the moon
turn, turn, turn again
and was in his chambers
by the next afternoon
turn, turn to the rain
and the wind
could ya tell me the facts?
i said without fear
turn, turn, turn again
that a friend of mine
would get ninety-nine years
turn, turn to the rain
and the wind


a crash on the highway
flew the car to a field
turn, turn, turn again
there was four persons killed
and he was at the wheel
turn, turn to the rain
and the wind
but i knew him as good
as i’m knowing myself
turn, turn, turn again
and he wouldn’t harm a life
that belonged to someone else
turn, turn to the rain
and the wind


the judge spoke
out of the side of his mouth
turn, turn, turn again
sayin’, “the witness who saw
he left little doubt”
turn, turn to the rain
and the wind
that may be true
he’s got a sentence to serve
turn, turn, turn again
but ninety-nine years
he just don’t deserve
turn, turn to the rain
and the wind


too late, too late
for his case it is sealed
turn, turn, turn again
his sentence is passed
and it cannot be repealed
turn, turn to the rain
and the wind
but he ain’t no criminal
and his crime it is none
turn, turn, turn again
what happened to him
could happen to anyone
turn, turn to the rain
and the wind


and at that the judge jerked forward
and his face it did freeze
turn, turn, turn again
sayin’, “could you kindly leave
my office now, please”
turn, turn to the rain
and the wind
well his eyes looked funny
and i stood up so slow
turn, turn, turn again
with no other choice
except for to go
turn, turn to the rain
and the wind


i walked down the hallway
and i heard his door slam
turn, turn, turn again
i walked down the courthouse stairs
and i did not understand
turn, turn to the rain
and the wind
and i played my guitar
through the night to the day
turn, turn, turn again
and the only tune
my guitar could play
was, “oh the cruel rain
and the wind”

well, i thought that the rain would cool things down
but it looks like it don’t
i’d like to get you to change your mind
but it looks like you won’t


from now on i’ll be busy
i am not going to nowhere fast
i’m just glad it’s over
and i’m seeing the real you at last


well, didn’t i risk my neck for you
didn’t i take chances?
didn’t i rise above it all for you
the most unfortunate circumstances?


well, i have had some rotten nights
didn’t think that they would pass
i’m just thankful and grateful
to be seeing the real you at last


i’m hungry and i’m irritable
and i’m tired of this bag of tricks
at one time there was nothing wrong with me
that you could not fix


well, i sailed through the storm
strapped to the mast
but the time has come
and i’m seeing the real you at last


when i met you, baby
you didn’t show no visible scars
you could ride like annie oakley
you could shoot like belle starr


well, i don’t mind a reasonable amount of trouble
trouble always comes to pass
but all i care about now
is that i’m seeing the real you at last


well, i’m going to quit this baby talk now
i guess i should have known
i got troubles, i think maybe you got troubles
i think maybe we’d better leave each other alone


whatever you going to do
please do it fast
i’m still trying to get used to
seeing the real you at last

something is burning, baby, are you aware?
something is the matter, baby, there’s smoke in your hair
are you still my friend, baby, show me a sign
is the love in your heart for me turning blind?


you’ve been avoiding the main streets for a long, long while
the truth that i’m seeking is in your missing file
what’s your position, baby, what’s going on?
why is the light in your eyes nearly gone?


i know everything about this place, or so it seems
am i no longer a part of your plans or your dreams?
well, it is so obvious that something has changed
what’s happening, baby, to make you act so strange?


something is burning, baby, here’s what i say
even the bloodhounds of london couldn’t find you today
i see the shadow of a man, baby, making you blue
who is he, baby, and what’s he to you?


we’ve reached the edge of the road, baby, where the pasture begins
where charity is supposed to cover up a multitude of sins
but where do you live, baby, and where is the light?
why are your eyes just staring off in the night?


i can feel it in the night when i think of you
i can feel it in the light and it’s got to be true
you can’t live by bread alone, you won’t be satisfied
you can’t roll away the stone if your hands are tied


got to start someplace, baby, can you explain?
please don’t fade away on me, baby, like the midnight train
answer me, baby, a casual look will do
just what in the world has come over you?


i can feel it in the wind and it’s upside down
i can feel it in the dust as i get off the bus on the outskirts of town
i’ve had the mexico city blues since the last hairpin curve
i don’t want to see you bleed, i know what you need but it is not what you deserve


something is burning, baby, something’s in flames
there’s a man going around calling names
ring down when you’re ready, baby, i’m waiting for you
i believe in the impossible, you know that i do

well, i had to move fast
and i couldn’t with you around my neck
i said i’d send for you and i did
what did you expect?
my hands are sweating
and we haven’t even started yet
i’ll go along with the charade
until i can think my way out
i know it was all a big joke
whatever it was about
someday maybe
i’ll remember to forget


i’m going to get my coat
i feel the breath of a storm
there’s something i’ve got to do tonight
you go inside and stay warm


has anybody seen my love?
has anybody seen my love?
has anybody seen my love?
i don’t know
has anybody seen my love?


you want to talk to me
go ahead and talk
whatever you got to say to me
won’t come as any shock
i must be guilty of something
you just whisper it into my ear
madame butterfly
she lulled me to sleep
in a town without pity
where the water runs deep
she said, “be easy, baby
there is nothing worth stealing in here”


you’re the one i’ve been looking for
you’re the one that’s got the key
but i can’t figure out whether i’m too good for you
or you’re too good for me


has anybody seen my love?
has anybody seen my love?
has anybody seen my love?
i don’t know
has anybody seen my love?


well, they’re not showing any lights tonight
and there’s no moon
there’s just a hot-blooded singer
singing “memphis in june”
while they’re beating the devil out of a guy
who’s wearing a powder-blue wig
later he’ll be shot
for resisting arrest
i can still hear his voice crying
in the wilderness
what looks large from a distance
close up is never that big


never could learn to drink that blood
and call it wine
never could learn to hold you, love
and call you mine


has anybody seen my love?
has anybody seen my love?
has anybody seen my love?
i don’t know
has anybody seen my love?

everything went from bad to worse, money never changed a thing
death kept following, tracking us down, at least i heard your bluebird sing
now somebody’s got to show their hand, time is an enemy
i know you’re long gone, i guess it must be up to me


if i’d thought about it i never would’ve done it, i guess i would’ve let it slide
if i'd-a paid attention to what others were thinking, the heart inside me would’ve died
but i was just too stubborn to ever be governed by enforced insanity
someone had to reach for the rising star, i guess it was up to me


now the union central is pulling out, the orchids are in bloom
i’ve only got me one good shirt left and it smells of stale perfume
in fourteen months i’ve only smiled once and i didn’t do it consciously
somebody’s got to find your trail, i guess it's gonna be up to me


it was like a revelation when you betrayed me with your touch
i’d just about convinced myself nothing had changed that much
the old rounder in the iron mask, he slipped me the master key
somebody had to unlock your heart, he said it was up to me


now i watched you slowly disappear down into the officers’ club
i would’ve followed you in the door, but i didn’t have a ticket stub
so i waited all night ’til the break of day, hoping one of us could get free
when the dawn came over the river bridge, i knew it was up to me


the only decent thing i did when i worked as a postal clerk
was to haul your picture down off the wall near the cage where i used to work
was i a fool or not to protect your real identity?
you looked a little burned out my friend, i thought it might be up to me


i met somebody face to face, i had to remove my hat
she’s everything i need and love, but i can’t be swayed by that
it frightens me, the awful truth, of how sweet life can be
but she ain’t goin' to make a move, i guess it must be up to me


now we heard the sermon on the mount, and i knew it was too complex
it didn’t amount to anything more than what the broken glass reflects
when you bite off more than you can chew, you got to pay the penalty
somebody’s got to tell the tale, i guess it must be up to me


dupree came in pimpin’ tonight to the thunderbird café
crystal wanted to talk to him, i had to look the other way
now i just can’t rest without you, love, i need your company
you ain’t goin' to cross the line, i guess it must be up to me


there’s a note left in the bottle, you can give it to estelle
she’s the one you been wondering about, but there’s really nothing much to tell
we both heard voices for a while, now the rest is history
somebody’s got to cry some tears, i guess it must be up to me


so go on boys, play your hands, life is a pantomime
the ringleaders from the county seat say you don’t have all that much time
and the girl with me behind the shades, she ain’t my property
one of us has got to hit the road, i guess it must be up to me


if we never meet again, baby, remember me
how my lone guitar played sweet for you that old-time melody
and the harmonica around my neck, i blew it for you, free
no one else could play that tune, you knew it was up to me

look out across the fields, see me returning
smoke is in your eye, you draw a smile
from the fireplace where my letters to you are burning
you’ve had time to think about it for a while


well, i’ve walked two hundred miles, now look me over
it’s the end of the chase and the moon is high
it won’t matter who loves who
you’ll love me or i’ll love you
when the night comes falling
when the night comes falling
when the night comes falling from the sky


i can see through your walls and i know you’re hurting
sorrow covers you up like a cape
only yesterday i know that you’ve been flirting
with disaster you somehow managed to escape


well, i can’t provide for you no easy answers
who are you that i should have to lie?
you’ll know all about it, love
it’ll fit you like a glove
when the night comes falling
when the night comes falling
when the night comes falling from the sky


i can hear your trembling heart beat like a river
you must have been protecting someone last time i called
i’ve never asked you for nothing that you couldn’t deliver
i’ve never asked you to set yourself up for a fall


i saw thousands who could have overcome the darkness
for the love of a lousy buck, i’ve watched them die
stick around, baby, we’re not through
don’t look for me, i’ll see you
when the night comes falling
when the night comes falling
when the night comes falling from the sky


in your teardrops, i can see my own reflection
it was on the northern border of texas where i crossed the line
i don’t want to be a fool starving for affection
i don’t want to drown in someone else’s wine


for all eternity i think i will remember
that icy wind that’s howling in your eye
you will seek me and you’ll find me
in the wasteland of your mind
when the night comes falling
when the night comes falling
when the night comes falling from the sky


well, i sent you my feelings in a letter
but you were gambling for support
this time tomorrow i’ll know you better
when my memory is not so short


this time i’m asking for freedom
freedom from a world which you deny
and you’ll give it to me now
i’ll take it anyhow
when the night comes falling
when the night comes falling
when the night comes falling from the sky
