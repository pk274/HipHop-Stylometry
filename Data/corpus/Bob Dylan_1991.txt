like the lion tears the flesh off of a man
so can a woman who passes herself off as a male
they sang “danny boy” at his funeral and the lord’s prayer
preacher talking ’bout christ betrayed
it’s like the earth just opened and swallowed him up
he reached too high, was thrown back to the ground
you know what they say about being nice to the right people on the way up
sooner or later you gonna meet them coming down


well, there ain’t no goin’ back
when your foot of pride come down
ain’t no goin’ back


hear ya got a brother named james, don’t forget faces or names
sunken cheeks and his blood is mixed
he looked straight into the sun and said revenge is mine
but he drinks, and drinks can be fixed
sing me one more song, about ya love me to the moon and the stranger
and your fall-by-the sword love affair with errol flynn
in these times of compassion when conformity’s in fashion
say one more stupid thing to me before the final nail is driven in


well, there ain’t no goin’ back
when your foot of pride come down
ain’t no goin’ back


there’s a retired businessman named red
cast down from heaven and he’s out of his head
he feeds off of everyone that he can touch
he said he only deals in cash or sells tickets to a plane crash
he’s not somebody that you play around with much
miss delilah is his, a philistine is what she is
she’ll do wondrous works with your fate
feed you coconut bread
spice buns in your bed
if you don’t mind sleeping with your head face down in a grave


well, there ain’t no goin’ back
when your foot of pride come down
ain’t no goin’ back


well, they’ll choose a man for you to meet tonight
you’ll play the fool and learn how to walk through the doors
how to enter into the gates of paradise
no, how to carry a burden too heavy to be yours
yeah, from the stage they’ll be trying’ to get water out rocks
a whore will pass the hat, collect a hundred grand and say thanks
they like to take all this money from sin, build big universities to study in
sing “amazing grace” all the way to the swiss banks


well, there ain’t no goin’ back
when your foot of pride come down
ain’t no goin’ back


they got some beautiful people out there, man
they can be a terror to your mind and show you how to hold your tongue
they got mystery written all over their forehead
they kill babies in the crib and say only the good die young
they don’t believe in mercy
judgement on them is something that you’ll never see
they can exalt you up or bring you down main route
turn you into anything that they want you to be


well, there ain’t no goin’ back
when your foot of pride come down
ain’t no goin’ back


yes, i guess i loved him too
i can still see him in my mind climbin’ that hill
did he make it to the top, well he probably did and dropped
struck down by the strength of the will
ain’t nothin’ left here partner, just the dust of a plague
that has left this whole town afraid
from now on, this’ll be where you’re from
let the dead bury the dead. your time will come
let hot iron blow as he raised the shade


well, there ain’t no goin’ back
when your foot of pride come down
ain’t no goin’ back

lately i've been having evil dreams
i wake up in a cold blue glare
i run the tape back in my mind
wonder if i took the wrong road somewhere
searching for the truth the way god designed it
well the real truth is that i might be afraid to find it


well, i need a woman, alright
need a woman, every night
to be with me and know me as i am
show me the kind of love that don't have to be condemned
and i want you to be that woman every day
be that woman every way


well i've had my eyes on you baby for five long years
well you probably don't know me at all
but i've seen your laughter and i've seen your tears
a tell-tale heart will show itself to anybody near
there's always some new stranger in the night
to lend a sympathetic ear


well i need a woman to be my own
i need a woman that's mine alone
seen you in the doorway, i seen you in the park
seen you in the sunshine, i seen you in the dark
and i want you to be that woman oh oh oh
be that woman every way


you keep listening to something long enough
you just bound to believe that it's true
you know there's some things that you put out
it's gonna come back on you
that which is not permanent don't last
whatever's waiting in the future
could be what you're running from in the past


well i need a woman, oh pull up
need a woman, drinking from the same cup
someone who likes simple things, is not afraid to bend
someone who don't make herself up to make every man her friend
and i want you to be that woman every day
be that woman every way


don't know what you got that i want
don't know what i got to give
don't know how much time i've got
don't know how long i'll live
the rebellion in my soul, why was it created?
to blur the focus of my mind and keep me isolated


but i need a woman, she ain't no crime
need a woman, all the time
to see the promised land with me as the time goes by
to rule my heart with sweetness and boldness from on high
and i want you to be that woman, yes i do
be that woman straight and true

come around you roving’ gamblers and a story i will tell
about the greatest gambler, you all should know him well
his name was will o’conley and he gambled all his life
he had twenty-seven children, yet he never had a wife
and it’s ride, willie, ride
roll, willie, roll
wherever you are a-gambling now, nobody really knows


he gambled in the white house and in the railroad yards
wherever there was people, there was willie and his cards
he had the reputation as the gamblingest man around
wives would keep their husbands home when willie came to town
and it’s ride, willie, ride
roll, willie, roll
wherever you are a-gambling now, nobody really knows


sailing’ down the mississippi to a town called new orleans
they’re still talking’ about their card game on that jackson river queen
“i’ve come to win some money,” gambling willie says
when the game finally ended up, the whole damn boat was his
and it’s ride, willie, ride
roll, willie, roll
wherever you are a-gambling now, nobody really knows


up in the rocky mountains in a town called cripple creek
there was an all-night poker game, lasted about a week
nine hundred miners had laid their money down
when willie finally left the room, he owned the whole damn town
and it’s ride, willie, ride
roll, willie, roll
wherever you are a-gambling now, nobody really knows


but willie had a heart of gold and this i know is true
he supported all his children and all their mothers too
he wore no rings or fancy things, like other gamblers wore
he spread his money far and wide, to help the sick and the poor
and it’s ride, willie, ride
roll, willie, roll
wherever you are a-gambling now, nobody really knows


when you played your cards with willie, you never really knew
whether he was bluffing or whether he was true
he won a fortune from a man who folded in his chair
the man, he left a diamond flush, willie didn’t even have a pair
and it’s ride, willie, ride
roll, willie, roll
wherever you are a-gambling now, nobody really knows


it was late one evening’ during a poker game
a man lost all his money, he said willie was to blame
he shot poor willie through the head, which was a tragic fate
when willie’s cards fell on the floor, they were aces backed with eights
and it’s ride, willie, ride
roll, willie, roll
wherever you are a-gambling now, nobody really knows


so all you roving’ gamblers, wherever you might be
the moral of the story is very plain to see
make your money while you can, before you have to stop
for when you pull that dead man’s hand, your gambling days are up
and it’s ride, willie, ride
roll, willie, roll
wherever you are a-gambling now, nobody really knows

early one mornin' the sun was shinin'
he was lyin' in bed
wondrin' if she'd changed at all
if her hair was still red
her folks they said their lives together
sure was gonna be rough
they never did like mama's homemade dress
papa's bankbook wasn't big enough
and he was standin' on the side of the road
rain fallin' on his shoes
headin' out for the old east coast
lord knows he's paid some dues, gettin' through
tangled up in blue


she was married when they first met
soon to be divorced
he helped her out of a jam i guess
but he used a little too much force
and they drove that car as far as they could
abandoned it out west
and split up on a dark sad night
both agreeing it was best
and she turned around to look at him
as he was walkin' away
she said, "this can't be the end
we'll meet on another day, on the avenue
tangled up in blue."


he had a job in the old north woods
workin' as a cook for a spell
but he never did like it all that much
and one day the axe just fell
when he drifted down to l.a.
where he reckoned to try his luck
workin' for a while in an airplane plant
loadin' cargo onto a truck
but all the while he was alone
the past was close behind
he seen a lot of women
but she never escaped his mind and he just grew
tangled up in blue


she was workin' in a topless place
i stopped in for a beer
i just kept lookin' at the side of her face
in the spotlight so clear
and later on as the crowd thinned out
i's about to do the same
she was standin' there, in back of my chair
said, "tell me, what's your name?"
i muttered somethin' underneath my breath
she studied the lines of my face
i must admit i felt a little uneasy
when she bent down to tie the laces of my shoe
tangled up in blue


she lit a burner on the stove
and offered me a pipe
"thought you'd never say hello," she said
"you look like the silent type"
then she opened up a book of poems
and handed it to me
written by an italian poet
from the thirteenth century
and every one of them words rang true
and flowed like burning coal
pourin' off of every page
like it was written in my soul from me to you
tangled up in blue


he was always in a hurry
too busy or too stoned
and everything that she ever planned
just had to be postponed
he thought they were successful
she thought they were blessed
with objects and material things
but i never was impressed
and when it all came crashin' down
i became withdrawn
the only thing i knew how to do
was keep on keepin' on like a bird that flew
tangled up in blue


so now i'm goin' back again
i got to get to her somehow
all the people we used to know
they're an illusion to me now
some are mathematicians
some are doctors' wives
don't know how it all got started
don't know what they're doin' with their lives
but me, i'm still on the road
headin' for another joint
we always did feel the same
we just saw it from a different point of view
tangled up in blue

oh, the age of the inmates
i remember quite freely
no younger than twelve
no older ’n seventeen
thrown in like bandits
and cast off like criminals
all inside the walls
on the grounds of red wing


from the dirty old mess hall
you march to the brick wall
too weary to talk
and too tired to sing
and it’s all afternoon
you remember your hometown
all inside the walls
the walls of red wing


oh, the gates are cast iron
and the walls are barbed wire
stay far from the fence
with the ’lectricity sting
and it’s keep down your head
and stay in your number
all inside the grounds of
the walls of red wing


oh, it’s fare thee well
to the deep hollow dungeon
farewell to the boardwalk
that takes you to the screen
and farewell to the minutes
they threaten you with it
all inside the grounds of
the walls of red wing


it’s many a guard
that stands around smiling
holding his club
like he was a king
hoping to get you
behind the wood piling
all inside the grounds of
the walls of red wing


the night aimed shadows
through the crossbar windows
and the wind punched hard
to make the wall-siding sing
it’s many a night
i pretended to be a-sleeping
all inside the grounds of
the walls of red wing


as the rain rattled heavy
on the bunkhouse shingles
and the sounds of the night
they made my ears ring
till the keys of the guards
clicked the tune of the morning
all inside the grounds of
the walls of red wing


oh, some of us’ll end up
in st. cloud prison
and some of us’ll end up
to be lawyers and things
and some of us’ll stand
to meet you on your crossroads
from inside the grounds of
the walls of red wing

who killed davey moore?
why, and what’s the reason for?


“not i,” says the referee
“don’t point your finger at me
i could’ve stopped it in the eighth
and maybe kept him from his fate
but the crowd would’ve booed, i’m sure
at not getting their money’s worth
it’s too bad he had to go
but there was a pressure on me too, you know
it wasn’t me that made him fall
no, you can’t blame me at all”

why, and what’s the reason for?


“not us,” says the angry crowd
whose screams filled the arena loud
“it’s too bad he died that night

we just meant to see some sweat
there is nothing wrong in that
it wasn’t us that made him fall
no, you can’t blame us at all”

“not me,” says his manager
puffing on a big cigar
“it’s hard to say, it’s hard to tell
i always thought that he was well
it’s too bad for his wife an’ kids he’s dead
but if he was sick, he should’ve said
it wasn’t me that made him fall
no, you can’t blame me at all”


who killed davey moore?
why, and what’s the reason for?


“not me,” says the gambling man
with his ticket stub still in his hand

anyway, i put money on him to win
it wasn’t me that made him fall
no, you can’t blame me at all”


who killed davey moore?
why, and what’s the reason for?


“not me,” says the boxing writer
pounding print on his old typewriter
saying, “boxing is not to blame
there’s just as much danger in a football game”
saying, “fist fighting is here to stay
it’s just the old american way
it wasn’t me that made him fall
no, you can’t blame me at all”


who killed davey moore?
why, and what’s the reason for?


“not me,” says the man whose fists
laid him low in a cloud of mist
who came here from cuba’s door
where boxing is not allowed no more
“i hit him, yes, it’s true
but that’s what i am paid to do
don’t say ‘murder,’ don’t say ‘kill’
it was destiny, it was god’s will”

why, and what’s the reason for?
