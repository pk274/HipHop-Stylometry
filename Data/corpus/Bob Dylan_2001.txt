well, i had to go down and see a guy named mr. goldsmith
a nasty, dirty, double-crossin’, backstabbin’ phony i didn’t wanna have to be dealin’ with
but i did it for you and all you gave me was a smile
well, i cried for you, now it’s your turn to cry awhile


i don’t carry deadweight, i’m no flash in the pan
all right, i’ll set you straight, can’t you see i’m a union man?
i’m lettin’ the cat out of the cage, i’m keeping a low profile
well, i cried for you, now it’s your turn, you can cry awhile


feel like a fighting rooster, feel better than i ever felt
but the pennsylvania line’s in an awful mess and the denver road is about to melt
i went to the church house, every day i go an extra mile
well, i cried for you, now it’s your turn, you can cry awhile


last night ’cross the alley there was a pounding on the walls
it must have been don pasqualli makin’ a two a.m. booty call
to break a trusting heart like mine was just your style
well, i cried for you, now it’s your turn to cry awhile


i’m on the fringes of the night, fighting back tears that i can’t control
some people they ain’t human, they got no heart or soul
well, i’m crying to the lord, i’m tryin’ to be meek and mild
yes, i cried for you, now it’s your turn, you can cry awhile


well, there’s preachers in the pulpits and babies in the cribs
i’m longin’ for that sweet fat that sticks to your ribs
i’m gonna buy me a barrel of whiskey, i’ll die before i turn senile
well, i cried for you, now it’s your turn, you can cry awhile


well, you bet on a horse and it ran on the wrong way
i always said you’d be sorry and today could be the day
i might need a good lawyer, could be your funeral, my trial
well, i cried for you, now it’s your turn, you can cry awhile

down over the window
comes the dazzling sunlit rays
through the back alleys—through the blinds
another one of them endless days


honey bees are buzzing
leaves begin to stir
i’m in love with my second cousin
i tell myself i could be happy forever with her


i keep listening for footsteps
but i ain’t hearing any
from the boat i fish for bullheads
i catch a lot, sometimes too many


a summer breeze is blowing
a squall is settin’ in
sometimes it’s just plain stupid
to get into any kind of wind


the old men ’round here, sometimes they get
on bad terms with the younger men
but old, young, age don’t carry weight
it doesn’t matter in the end


one of the boss’ hangers-on
comes to call at times you least expect
try to bully ya—strong-arm you—inspire you with fear
it has the opposite effect


there’s a new grove of trees on the outskirts of town
the old one is long gone
timber two-foot-six across
burns with the bark still on


they say times are hard, if you don’t believe it
you can just follow your nose
it don’t bother me—times are hard everywhere
we’ll just have to see how it goes


my old man, he’s like some feudal lord
got more lives than a cat
never seen him quarrel with my mother even once
things come alive or they fall flat


you can smell the pinewood burning
you can hear the school bell ring
gotta get up near the teacher if you can
if you wanna learn anything


romeo, he said to juliet, “you got a poor complexion
it doesn’t give your appearance a very youthful touch!”
juliet said back to romeo, “why don’t you just shove off
if it bothers you so much”


they all got out of here any way they could
the cold rain can give you the shivers
they went down the ohio, the cumberland, the tennessee
all the rest of them rebel rivers


if you ever try to interfere with me or cross my path again
you do so at the peril of your own life
i’m not quite as cool or forgiving as i sound
i’ve seen enough heartaches and strife


my grandfather was a duck trapper
he could do it with just dragnets and ropes
my grandmother could sew new dresses out of old cloth
i don’t know if they had any dreams or hopes


i had them once though, i suppose, to go along
with all the ring-dancing christmas carols on all of the christmas eves
i left all my dreams and hopes
buried under tobacco leaves


it’s not always easy kicking someone out
gotta wait a while—it can be an unpleasant task
sometimes somebody wants you to give something up
and tears or not, it’s too much to ask

trapped in the heart of it, tryin' to get away
i was raised in the country, i been working’ in the town

sky full of fire, pain pourin’ down

the seasons they are turnin'
and my sad heart is yearnin'
to hear again the songbird’s sweet melodious tone
won't you meet me out in the moonlight alone?


the dusky light, the day is losing
orchids, poppies, black-eyed susan
the earth and sky that melts with flesh and bone
won't you meet me out in the moonlight alone?


the air is thick and heavy
all along the levy
where the geese into the countryside have flown
won’t you meet me out in the moonlight alone?


well, i’m preaching peace and harmony
the blessings of tranquility
yet i know when the time is right to strike
i'll take you 'cross the river dear
you've no need to linger here
i know the kinds of things you like


the clouds are turning crimson
the leaves fall from the limbs and
the branches cast their shadows over stone
won't you meet me out in the moonlight alone?


the boulevards of cypress trees
the masquerade of birds and bees
the petals, pink and white, the wind has blown
won't you meet me out in the moonlight alone?


the trailing moss and mystic glow
the purple blossoms soft as snow
my tears keep flowing to the sea
doctor, lawyer, indian chief
it takes a thief to catch a thief
for whom does the bell toll for, love?
it tolls for you and me


my pulse is running through my palm
the sharp hills are rising from
yellow fields with twisted oaks that groan
won't you meet me out in the moonlight alone?

man comes to the door, i say, “for whom are you looking?”
he says, “your wife,” i say, “she’s busy in the kitchen cooking”

things will be all right by and by


been working on the mainline, working like the devil
the game is the same, it’s just up on a different level
poor boy, dressed in black
police at your back


poor boy in a red hot town
out beyond the twinkling stars
riding first-class trains, making the rounds
trying to keep from falling between the cars


othello told desdemona, “i’m cold, cover me with a blanket
by the way, what happened to that poison wine?”
she said, “i gave it to you, you drank it”
poor boy, laying them straight, picking up the cherries falling off the plate

had to go to florida, dodging them georgia laws
poor boy, in the hotel called the palace of gloom
calls down to room service, says send up a room


my mother was a daughter of a wealthy farmer
my father was a traveling salesman, i never met him

i don’t know any more than this
poor boy, picking up sticks
build you a house out of mortar and bricks


knocking on the door, i say, “who is it and where are you from?”
man says, “freddy!” i say, “freddy who?” he says, “freddy or not here i come”
poor boy beneath the stars that shine
washing them dishes, feeding them swine

i got my back to the sun ’cause the light is too intense

you ain’t got no brains, no how
you went years without me
might as well keep going now


your charms have broken many a heart and mine is surely one
