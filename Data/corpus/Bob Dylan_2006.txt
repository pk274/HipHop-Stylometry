as i walked out tonight in the mystic garden
the wounded flowers were danglin' from the vine
i was passin' by yon cool and crystal fountain
someone hit me from behind


ain't talkin', just a'walkin'
through this weary world of woe
heart burnin', still yearnin'
no one on earth would ever know


they say prayer has the power to help
so pray from the mother
in the human heart an evil spirit can dwell
i'm a'tryin' to love my neighbor and do good unto others
but oh, mother, things ain't goin' well


ain't talkin', just a'walkin'
i'll burn that bridge before you can cross
heart burnin', still yearnin'
they'll be no mercy for ya' once you've lost


now i'm all worn down by weepin'
my eyes are filled with tears, my lips are dry
if i catch my opponents ever sleepin'
i'll just slaughter them where they lie


ain't talkin', just a'walkin'
through the world mysterious and vague
heart burnin', still yearnin'
walkin' a'through the cities of the plague


well, the whole world is filled with speculation
the whole wide world which people say is round
they will tear your mind away from contemplation
they will jump on your misfortune when you're down


ain't talkin', just a'walkin'
eatin' hog-eyed grease in a hog-eyed town
heart burnin', still yearnin'
someday you'll be glad to have me around


they will crush you with wealth and power
every wakin' moment you could crack
i'll make the most of one last extra hour
i'll avenge my father's death an' i'll step back


ain't talkin', just walkin'
hand me down my walkin' cane
heart burnin', still yearnin'
got to get ya' out of my miserable brain


all o' my loyal and much-loved companions
they approve of me and share my code
i practice a faith that's been long abandoned
ain't no altars on this long and lonesome road


ain't talkin', just a'walkin'
my mule is sick, my horse is blind
heart burnin', still yearnin'
thinkin' ‘bout that gal i left behind


well, it's bright in the heavens and the wheels are flyin'
fame and honor never seem to fade
the fire gone out but the light is never dyin'
who says i can't get heavenly aid?


ain't talkin', just a'walkin'
carryin' a dead man's shield
heart burnin', still yearnin'
a'walkin' a'with a toothache in my heel


the sufferin' is unending
every nook and cranny has its tears
i'm a'not playin', i'm not pretending
i'm not nursin' any superfluous fears


ain't talkin', just a'walkin'
walkin' ever since the other night
heart burnin', still yearnin'
walkin' ‘til i'ma clean outta sight


as i walked out in the mystic garden
on a hot summer day, a hot summer lawn
"excuse me, ma'am, i beg your pardon
there's no one here, the gardener is gone"


ain't talkin', a'just a'walkin'
up the road around the bend
heart burnin', still yearnin'
in the last outback, at the world's end

beyond the horizon, behind the sun
at the end of the rainbow life has only begun
in the long hours of twilight 'neath the stardust above
beyond the horizon it is easy to love


my wretched heart's pounding
i felt an angel's kiss
my memories are drowning
in mortal bliss

beyond the horizon, in the springtime or fall
love waits forever for one and for all


beyond the horizon across the divide
'round about midnight, we'll be on the same side
down in the valley the water runs cold
beyond the horizon someone prayed for your soul


i'm touched with desire
what don't i do?
i'll throw the logs on the fire
i'll build my world around you

beyond the horizon, at the end of the game
every step that you take, i'm walking the same


beyond the horizon the night winds blow
the theme of a melody from many moons ago
the bells of st. mary, how sweetly they chime
beyond the horizon i found you just in time


it's dark and it's dreary
i ponder in vain
i'm weakened, i'm weary
my repentance is plain

beyond the horizon o'er the treacherous sea
i still can't believe that you've set aside your love for me


beyond the horizon, 'neath crimson skies
in the soft light of morning i'll follow you with my eyes
through countries and kingdoms and temples of stone
beyond the horizon right down to the bone



it's late in the season
never knew, never cared
whatever the reason
someone's life has been spared


beyond the horizon the sky is so blue
i've got more than a lifetime to live lovin' you

lost john sitting on a railroad track
something's out of whack
blues this morning falling down like hail
gonna leave a greasy trail


gonna travel the world is what i'm gonna do
then come back and see you
all i ever do is struggle and strive
if i don't do anybody any harm, i might make it back home alive


i'm the oldest son of a crazy man
i'm in a cowboy band
got a pile of sins to pay for and i ain't got time to hide
i'd walk through a blazing fire, baby, if i knew you was on the other side


oh, i miss you nettie moore
and my happiness is o'er
winter's gone, the river's on the rise
i loved you then and ever shall
but there's no one here left to tell
the world has gone black before my eyes


the world of research has gone berserk
too much paperwork
albert's in the graveyard, frankie's raising hell
i'm beginning to believe what the scriptures tell


i'm going where the southern crosses the yellow dog
get away from these demagogues
and these bad luck women stick like glue
it's either one or the other or neither of the two


she says, "look out daddy, don't want you to tear your pants
you can get wrecked in this dance."
they say whiskey will kill ya, but i don't think it will
i'm riding with you to the top of the hill


oh, i miss you nettie moore
and my happiness is o'er
winter's gone, the river's on the rise
i loved you then and ever shall
but there's no one here left to tell
the world has gone black before my eyes


don't know why my baby never looked so good before
i don't have to wonder no more
she been cooking all day and it's gonna take me all night
i can't eat all that stuff in a single bite


the judge is coming in, everybody rise
lift up your eyes
you can do what you please, you don't need my advice
before you call me any dirty names you better think twice


getting light outside, the temperature dropped
i think the rain has stopped
i'm going to make you come to grips with fate
when i'm through with you, you'll learn to keep your business straight


oh, i miss you nettie moore
and my happiness is o'er
winter's gone, the river's on the rise
i loved you then and ever shall
but there's no one here left to tell
the world has gone black before my eyes


the bright spark of the steady lights
has dimmed my sights
when you're around all my grief gives 'way
a lifetime with you is like some heavenly day


everything i've ever known to be right has been proven wrong
i'll be drifting along
the woman i'm a-loving, she rules my heart
no knife could ever cut our love apart


today i'll stand in faith and raise
the voice of praise
the sun is strong, i'm standing in the light
i wish to god that it were night


oh, i miss you nettie moore
and my happiness is o'er
winter's gone, the river's on the rise
i loved you then and ever shall
but there's no one here left to tell
the world has gone black before my eyes

i rolled and i tumbled, i cried the whole night long
i rolled and i tumbled, i cried the whole night long
woke up this morning', i must have bet my money wrong


i got troubles so hard, i can't stand the strain
i got troubles so hard, i just can't stand the strain
some young lazy slut has charmed away my brains


the landscape is glowing', gleaming' in the golden light of day
the landscape is glowing', gleaming' in the gold light of day
i am not holding nothing' back now, i am not standing' in anybody's way


well, i did all i know just to keep you off my mind
well, i did all i know just to keep you off my mind
well, i paid and i paid and my suffering' heart is always on the line


well, i get up in the dawn and i go down and lay in the shade
i get up in the dawn and i go down and lay in the shade
i ain't nobody's house boy, i ain't nobody's well trained maid


i'm flat-out spent, this woman has been driving' me to tears
i'm flat-out spent, this woman she has been driving' me to tears
this woman so crazy, i swear i ain't gonna touch another one for years


well, the warm weather is coming' and the buds are on the vine
the warm weather's comin', the buds are on the vine
ain't nothing so depressing as trying to satisfy this woman of mine


i got up this morning', saw the rising sun return
well, i got up this morning', seen the rising sun return
sooner or later you too shall burn


the night's filled with shadows, the years are filled with early doom
the night's filled with shadows, the years are filled with early doom
i've been conjuring up all these long dead souls from their crumbling' tombs


let's forgive each other darling', let's go down to the greenwood glen
let's forgive each other darling', let's go down to the greenwood glen
let's put our heads together, let's put old matters to an end


now i rolled and i tumbled and i cried the whole night long
ah, i rolled and i tumbled, i cried the whole night long
i woke up this morning, i think i must be traveling' wrong

spirit on the water
darkness on the face of the deep
i keep thinking about you baby
i can't hardly sleep


i'm traveling by land
traveling through the dawn of day
you're always on my mind
i can't stay away


i'd forgotten about you
then you turned up again
i always knew
that we were meant to be more than friends


when you are near
it's just as plain as it can be
i'm wild about you, gal
you ought to be a fool about me


can't explain
the sources of this hidden pain
you burned your way into my heart
you got the key to my brain


i've been trampling through mud
praying to the powers above
i'm sweating blood
you got a face that begs for love


life without you
doesn't mean a thing to me
if i can't have you
i'll throw my love into the deep blue sea


sometimes i wonder
why you can't treat me right
you do good all day
then you do wrong all night


when you're with me
i'm a thousand times happier than i could ever say
what does it matter
what price i pay


they brag about your sugar
brag about it all over town
put some sugar in my bowl
i feel like laying down


i'm pale as a ghost
holding a blossom on a stem
you ever seen a ghost? no
but you have heard of them


i see you there
i'm blinded by the colors i see
i take good care
of what belongs to me


i hear your name
ringing up and down the line
i'm saying it plain
these ties are strong enough to bind


your sweet voice
calls out from some old familiar shrine
i got no choice
can't believe these things would ever fade from your mind


i could live forever
with you perfectly
you don't ever
have to make a fuss over me


from east to west
ever since the world began
i only mean it for the best
i want to be with you any way i can


i been in a brawl
now i'm feeling the wall
i'm going away baby
i won't be back ‘till fall


high on the hill
you can carry all my thoughts with you
you've numbed my will
this love could tear me in two


i wanna be with you in paradise
and it seems so unfair
i can't go to paradise no more
i killed a man back there


you think i'm over the hill
you think i'm past my prime
let me see what you got
we can have a whoppin' good time

if it keeps on raining' the levee gonna break
if it keeps on raining' the levee gonna break
everybody saying this is a day only the lord could make


well i worked on the levee mama, both night and day
well i worked on the levee mama, both night and day
i got to the river and i threw my clothes away

i paid my time and now i'm as good as new
i paid my time and now i'm as good as new
they can't take me back, not unless i want them to


if it keeps on raining' the levee gonna break
if it keeps on raining' the levee gonna break
some of these people gonna strip you of all they can take

i can't stop here, i ain't ready to unload
i can't stop here, i ain't ready to unload
riches and salvation can be waiting
behind the next bend in the road


i picked you up from the gutter and this is the thanks i get
i picked you up from the gutter and this is the thanks i get
you say you want me to quit ya, i told you no, not just yet

i look in your eyes, i see nobody else but me
i look in your eyes, i see nobody other than me
i see all that i am and all i hope to be


if it keeps on raining' the levee gonna break
if it keeps on raining' the levee gonna break
some of these people don't know which road to take

when i'm with you i forget i was ever blue
when i'm with you i forget i was ever blue
without you there's no meaning in anything i do


some people on the road carrying everything that they own
some people on the road carrying everything that they own
some people got barely enough skin to cover their bones

put on your cat clothes, mama, put on your evening dress
put on your cat clothes, mama, put on your evening dress
a few more years of hard work
then there'll be a thousand years of happiness


if it keeps on raining' the levee gonna break
if it keeps on raining' the levee gonna break
i tried to get you to love me, but i won't repeat that mistake

if it keeps on raining' the levee gonna break
if it keeps on raining' the levee gonna break
plenty of cheap stuff out there still around that you take


i woke up this morning, butter and eggs in my bed
i woke up this morning, butter and eggs in my bed
i ain't got enough room to even raise my head

come back, baby, say we never more will part
come back, baby, say we never more will part
don't be a stranger without a brain or heart


if it keeps on raining' the levee gonna break
if it keeps on raining' the levee gonna break
some people still sleeping', some people are wide awake

thunder on the mountain, fires on the moon
there's a ruckus in the alley and the sun will be here soon
today's the day, gonna grab my trombone and blow
well, there's hot stuff here and it's everywhere i go


i was thinking' 'bout alicia keys, couldn't keep from crying
when she was born in hell's kitchen, i was living down the line
i'm wondering where in the world alicia keys could be
i have been looking for her even clear through tennessee


feel like my soul is beginning to expand
look into my heart and you will sort of understand
you brought me here, now you're trying to run me away
the writing's on the wall, come read it, come see what it say


thunder on the mountain, rolling like a drum
gonna sleep over there, that's where the music coming from
i don't need any guide, i already know the way
remember this, i'm your servant both night and day


the pistols are poppin' and the power is down
i'd like to try something' but i'm so far from town
the sun keeps shining'
and the north wind keeps picking up speed
gonna forget about myself for a while, gonna go out and see what others need


i've been sitting down studying the art of love
i think it will fit me like a glove
i want some real good woman to do just what i say
everybody got to wonder
what's the matter with this cruel world today


thunder on the mountain rolling to the ground
gonna get up in the morning walk the hard road down
some sweet day i'll stand beside my king
i wouldn't betray your love or any other thing


gonna raise me an army, some tough sons of bitches
i'll recruit my army from the orphanages
i been to st. herman's church and i've said my religious vows
i've sucked the milk out of a thousand cows


i got the porkchops, she got the pie
she ain't no angel and neither am i
shame on your greed, shame on your wicked schemes
i'll say this, i don't give a damn about your dreams


thunder on the mountain heavy as can be
mean old twister bearing down on me
all the ladies of washington scrambling to get out of town
looks like something bad gonna happen
better roll your airplane down


everybody's going and i want to go too
don't wanna take a chance with somebody new
i did all i could and i did it right there and then
i've already confessed, no need to confess again


gonna make a lot of money, gonna go up north
i'll plant and i'll harvest what the earth brings forth
the hammer's on the table, the pitchfork's on the shelf
for the love of god, you ought to take pity on yourself

there's an evening' haze settlin' over the town
starlight by the edge of the creek
the buyin' power of the proletariat's gone down
money's gettin' shallow and weak
the place i love best is a sweet memory
it's a new path that we trod
they say low wages are a reality
if we want to compete abroad


my cruel weapons have been put on the shelf
come sit down on my knee
you are dearer to me than myself
as you yourself can see
i'm listening' to the steel rails hum
got both eyes tight shut
just sitting here trying to keep the hunger from
creeping it's way into my gut


meet me at the bottom, don't lag behind
bring me my boots and shoes
you can hang back or fight your best on the front line
sing a little bit of these workingman's blues


now, i'm sailing' on back, ready for the long haul
tossed by the winds and the seas
i'll drag them all down to hell and i'll stand them at the wall
i'll sell them to their enemies
i'm trying' to feed my soul with thought
gonna sleep off the rest of the day
sometimes no one wants what we got
sometimes you can't give it away


now the place is ringed with countless foes
some of them may be deaf and dumb
no man, no woman knows
the hour that sorrow will come
in the dark i hear the night birds call
i can hear a lover's breath
i sleep in the kitchen with my feet in the hall
sleep is like a temporary death


meet me at the bottom, don't lag behind
bring me my boots and shoes
you can hang back or fight your best on the front line
sing a little bit of these workingman's blues


well, they burned my barn, they stole my horse
i can't save a dime
i got to be careful, i don't want to be forced
into a life of continual crime
i can see for myself that the sun is sinking
how i wish you were here to see
tell me now, am i wrong in thinking
that you have forgotten me?


now they worry and they hurry and they fuss and they fret
they waste your nights and days
them i will forget
but you i'll remember always
old memories of you to me have clung
you've wounded me with words
gonna have to straighten out your tongue
it's all true, everything you have heard


meet me at the bottom, don't lag behind
bring me my boots and shoes
you can hang back or fight your best on the front line
sing a little bit of these workingman's blues


in you, my friend, i find no blame
wanna look in my eyes, please do
no one can ever claim
that i took up arms against you
all across the peaceful sacred fields
they will lay you low
they'll break your horns and slash you with steel
i say it so it must be so


now i'm down on my luck and i'm black and blue
gonna give you another chance
i'm all alone and i'm expecting you
to lead me off in a cheerful dance
got a brand new suit and a brand new wife
i can live on rice and beans
some people never worked a day in their life
don't know what work even means


meet me at the bottom, don't lag behind
bring me my boots and shoes
you can hang back or fight your best on the front line
sing a little bit of these workingman's blues
