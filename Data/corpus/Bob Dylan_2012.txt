listen to that duquesne whistle blowing
blowing like it's gonna sweep my world away
i wanna stop at carbondale and keep on going
that duquesne train gon' ride me night and day


you say i'm a gambler, you say i'm a pimp
but i ain't neither one
listen to that duquesne whistle blowing
sounding like it's on a final run


listen to that duquesne whistle blowing
blowing like she never blowed before
blue light blinking, red light glowing
blowing like she's at my chamber door


you smiling through the fence at me
just like you always smiled before
listen to that duquesne whistle blowing
blowing like she ain't gon' blow no more


can't you hear that duquesne whistle blowing?
blowing like the sky's gonna blow apart
you're the only thing alive that keeps me going
you're like a time bomb in my heart


i can hear a sweet voice steadily calling
must be the mother of our lord
listen to that duquesne whistle blowing
blowing like my woman's on board


listen to that duquesne whistle blowing
blowing like it's gon' blow my blues away
you old rascal, i know exactly where you're going
i'll lead you there myself at the break of day


i wake up every morning with that woman in my bed
everybody telling me she's gone to my head
listen to that duquesne whistle blowing
blowing like it's gon' kill me dead


can't you hear that duquesne whistle blowing?
blowing through another no good town
the lights on my native land are glowing
i wonder if they'll know me next time 'round


i wonder if that old oak tree's still standing
that old oak tree, the one we used to climb
listen to that duquesne whistle blowing
blowing like she's blowing right on time

all the early roman kings in their sharkskin suits
bowties and buttons, high top boots
driving the spikes in, blazing the rails
nailed in their coffins in top hats and tails


fly away, little bird
fly away, flap your wings
fly by night
like the early roman kings


all the early roman kings in the early, early morn’
coming down the mountain, distributing the corn
speeding through the forest, racing down the track
you try to get away, they drag you back


tomorrow is friday
we’ll see what it brings
everybody’s talking
‘bout the early roman kings


they’re peddlers and they’re meddlers, they buy and they sell
they destroyed your city, they’ll destroy you as well
they’re lecherous and treacherous, hell bent for leather
each of them bigger than all men put together


sluggers and muggers
wearing fancy gold rings
all the women going crazy
for the early roman kings


i'll dress up your wounds with a blood clotted rag
i ain’t afraid to make love to a bitch or a hag
if you see me coming and you’re standing there
wave your handkerchief in the air


i ain’t dead yet
my bell still rings
i keep my fingers crossed
like the early roman kings


i'll strip you of life, strip you of breath
ship you down to the house of death
one day you will ask for me
there’ll be no one else that you’ll want to see


bring down my fiddle
tune up my strings
gonna break it wide open
like the early roman kings


i was up on black mountain the day detroit fell
they killed them all off and they sent them to hell
ding dong daddy, you’re coming up short
gonna put you on trial in a sicilian court


i’ve had my fun
i’ve had my flings
gonna shake ‘em all down
like the early roman kings

it's been such a long, long time
since we loved each other, when our hearts were true
one time, for one brief day, i was the man for you
last night i heard you talking in your sleep
saying things you shouldn't say, oh baby
you just may have to go to jail someday


is there a place we can go, is there anybody we can see?
maybe it's the same for you as it is for me
i ain't seen my family in twenty years
that ain't easy to understand, they may be dead by now
i lost track of 'em after they lost their land


shake it up, baby, twist and shout
you know what it's all about
what are you doing out there in the sun anyway?
don't you know, the sun can burn your brains right out


my enemy crashed into the dust
stopped dead in his tracks and he lost his lust
he was run down hard and he broke apart
he died in shame, he had an iron heart


i wear dark glasses to cover my eyes
there are secrets in 'em that i can't disguise
come back, baby
if i hurt your feelings, i apologize


two trains running side by side
forty miles wide, down the eastern line
you don't have to go
i just came to you because you're a friend of mine


i think that when my back was turned
the whole world behind me burned
it's been a while
since we walked down that long, long aisle


we cried on a cold and frosty morn
we cried because our souls were torn
so much for tears
so much for these long and wasted years

i'm gonna walk across the desert 'til i'm in my right mind
i won't even think about what i left behind
nothing back there anyway that i can call my own
go back home, leave me alone


it's a long road
it's a long and narrow way
if i can't work up to you
you'll surely have to work down to me someday


ever since the british burned the white house down
there's a bleeding wound in the heart of town
i saw you drinking from an empty cup
i saw you buried and i saw you dug up


it's a long road
it's a long and narrow way
if i can't work up to you
you'll surely have to work down to me someday


look down, angel from the skies
help my weary soul to rise
i kissed her cheek, i dragged your plow
you broke my heart, i was your friend 'til now


it's a long road
it's a long and narrow way
if i can't work up to you
you'll surely have to work down to me someday


in the courtyard of the golden sun
you stand and fight or you break and run
you went and lost your lovely head
for a drink of wine and a crust of bread


it's a long road
it's a long and narrow way
if i can't work up to you
you'll surely have to work down to me someday


we looted and we plundered on distant shores
why is my share not equal to yours?
your father left you, your mother too
even death has washed its hands of you


it's a long road
it's a long and narrow way
if i can't work up to you
you'll surely have to work down to me someday


this is hard country to stay alive in
blades are everywhere and they're breaking my skin
i'm armed to the hilt and i'm struggling hard
you won't get out of here unscarred


it's a long road
it's a long and narrow way
if i can't work up to you
you'll surely have to work down to me someday


you got too many lovers waiting at the wall
if i had a thousand tongues, i couldn't count them all
yesterday i could've thrown them all in the sea
today even one may be too much for me


it's a long road
it's a long and narrow way
if i can't work up to you
you'll surely have to work down to me someday


keep walking baby, you could do no wrong
put your arms around me, where they belong
i won't take you on a roller-coaster ride
lay my hands all over you, tie you to my side


it's a long road
it's a long and narrow way
if i can't work up to you
you'll surely have to work down to me someday


i've got a heavy stacked woman with a smile on her face
and she has crowned my soul with grace
i'm still hurting from an arrow that pierced my chest
i'm gonna have to take my head and bury it between your breasts


it's a long road
it's a long and narrow way
if i can't work up to you
you'll surely have to work down to me someday


been dark all night but now it's dawn
the moving finger is moving on
you can guard me while i sleep
kiss away the tears i weep


it's a long road
it's a long and narrow way
if i can't work up to you
you'll surely have to work down to me someday


i love women and she loves men
we've been to the west and we going back again
i heard a voice at the dusk of day
saying, "be gentle brother, be gentle and pray."


it's a long road
it's a long and narrow way
if i can't work up to you
you'll surely have to work down to me someday

well i'm grinding my life out, steady and sure
nothing more wretched than what i must endure
i'm drenched in the light that shines from the sun
i could stone you to death for the wrongs that you done


sooner or later, you make a mistake
i'll put you in a chain that you never will break
legs and arms and body and bone
i pay in blood, but not my own


night after night, day after day
they strip your useless hopes away
the more i take the more i give
the more i die the more i live


i got something in my pocket make your eyeballs swim
i got dogs could tear you limb from limb
i'm circling around the southern zone
i pay in blood, but not my own


low cards are what i've got
but i'll play this hand whether i like it or not
i'm sworn to uphold the laws of god
you could put me out in front of a firing squad


i've been out and around with the rowdy men
just like you, my handsome friend
my head's so hard, must be made of stone
i pay in blood, but not my own


another politician pumping out the piss
another ragged beggar blowin' you a kiss
you got the same eyes that your mother does
if only you could prove who your father was


someone must have slipped a drug in your wine
you gulped it down and you cross the line
man can't live by bread alone
i pay in blood, but not my own


how i made it back home, nobody knows
or how i survived so many blows
i've been through hell, what good did it do?
you bastard! i'm suppose to respect you?


i'll give you justice, i'll fatten your purse
show me your moral virtues first
hear me holler and hear me moan
i pay in blood but not my own


you bit your lover in the bed
come here, i'll break your lousy head
our nation must be saved and freed
you've been accused of murder, how do you plead?


this is how i spend my days
i came to bury, not to praise
i'll drink my fill and sleep alone
i pay in blood, but not my own

doctor, doctor tell me the time of day
another bottle's empty, another penny spent
he turned around and he slowly walked away
they shot him in the back and down he went


shine your light
movin' on
you burned so bright
roll on, john


from the liverpool docks to the red-light hamburg streets
down in the quarry with the quarrymen
playing to the big crowds, playing to the cheap seats
another day in the life on your way to your journey's end


shine your light
movin' on
you burned so bright
roll on, john


sailin' through the trade winds bound for the south
rags on your back just like any other slave
they tied your hands and they clamped your mouth
wasn't no way out of that deep dark cave


shine your light
movin' on
you burned so bright
roll on, john


i heard the news today, oh boy
they hauled your ship up on the shore
now the city gone dark, there is no more joy
they tore the heart right out and cut him to the core


shine your light
movin' on
you burned so bright
roll on, john


put on your bags and get 'em packed
leave right now, you won't be far from wrong
the sooner you go the quicker you'll be back
you've been cooped up on an island far too long


shine your light
movin' on
you burned so bright
roll on, john


slow down you're moving way too fast
come together right now over me
your bones are weary, you're about to breathe your last
lord, you know how hard that it can be


shine your light
movin' on
you burned so bright
roll on, john


roll on, john, roll through the rain and snow
take the right-hand road and go where the buffalo roam
they'll trap you in an ambush before you know
too late now to sail back home


shine your light
movin' on
you burned so bright
roll on, john


tyger, tyger burning bright
i pray the lord my soul to keep
in the forests of the night
cover 'em over and let him sleep


shine your light
movin' on
you burned so bright
roll on, john

in scarlet town, where i was born
there’s ivy leaf and silver thorn
the streets have names that you can’t pronounce
gold is down to a quarter of an ounce
the music starts and the people sway
everybody says, “are you going my way?"
uncle tom still working' for uncle bill
scarlet town is under the hill


scarlet town in the month of may
sweet william on his deathbed lay
mistress mary by the side of the bed
kissing' his face and heaping prayers on his head
so brave and true, so gentle is he
i’ll weep for him as he would weep for me
little boy blue come blow your horn
in scarlet town, where i was born


scarlet town, in the hot noon hours
there’s palm-leaf shadows and scattered flowers
beggars crouching at the gate
help comes, but it comes too late
by marble slabs and in fields of stone
you make your humble wishes known
i touched the garment, but the hem was torn
in scarlet town, where i was born


in scarlet town, the end is near
the seven wonders of the world are here
the evil and the good living' side by side
all human forms seem glorified
put your heart on a platter and see who will bite
see who will hold you and kiss you good night
there’s walnut groves and maplewood
in scarlet town crying' won’t do no good


in scarlet town, you fight your father’s foes
up on the hill, a chilly wind blows
you fight ‘em on high and you fight 'em down in
you fight 'em with whiskey, morphine and gin
you’ve got legs that can drive men mad
a lot of things we didn’t do that i wish we had
in scarlet town, the sky is clear
you’ll wish to god that you stayed right here


set ‘em joe, play “walking the floor"
play it for my flat-chested junkie whore
i’m staying up late, i’m making amends
while we smile, all heaven descends
if love is a sin, then beauty is a crime
all things are beautiful in their time
the black and the white, the yellow and the brown
it’s all right there in front of you in scarlet town

the pale moon rose in its glory
out o'er the western town
she told a sad, sad story
of the great ship that went down


t'was the fourteenth day of april
over the waves she rode
sailing into tomorrow
to a gilded age foretold


the night was black with starlight
the seas were sharp and clear
moving through the shadows
the promised hour was near


lights were holding steady
gliding over the foam
all the lords and ladies
heading for their eternal home


the chandeliers were swaying
from the balustrades above
the orchestra was playing
songs of faded love


the watchman, he lay dreaming
as the ballroom dancers twirled
he dreamed the titanic was sinking
into the underworld


leo took his sketchbook
he was often so inclined
he closed his eyes and painted
the scenery in his mind


cupid struck his bosom
and broke it with a snap
the closest woman to him
he fell into her lap


he heard a loud commotion
something sounded wrong
his inner spirit was saying
that he couldn't stand here long


he staggered to the quarterdeck
no time now to sleep
water on the quarterdeck
already three foot deep


smokestack was leaning sideways
heavy feet began to pound
he walked into the whirlwind
sky splitting all around


the ship was going under
the universe had opened wide
the roll was called up yonder
the angels turned aside


lights down in the hallway
flickering dim and dull
dead bodies already floating
in the double bottom hull


the engines then exploded
propellers they failed to start
the boilers overloaded
the ship's bow split apart


passengers were flying
backward, forward, far and fast
they mumbled, fumbled, and tumbled
each one more weary than the last


the veil was torn asunder
'tween the hours of twelve and one
no change, no sudden wonder
could undo what had been done


the watchman lay there dreaming
at forty-five degrees
he dreamed that the titanic was sinking
dropping to her knees


wellington he was sleeping
his bed began to slide
his valiant heart was beating
he pushed the tables aside


glass of shattered crystal
lay scattered roundabout
he strapped on both his pistols
how long could he hold out?


his men and his companions
were nowhere to be seen
in silence there he waited for
time and space to intervene


the passageway was narrow
there was blackness in the air
he saw every kind of sorrow
heard voices everywhere


alarm-bells were ringing
to hold back the swelling tide
friends and lovers clinging
to each other side by side


mothers and their daughters
descending down the stairs
jumped into the icy waters
love and pity sent their prayers


the rich man, mister astor
kissed his darling wife
he had no way of knowing
be the last trip of his life


calvin, blake, and wilson
gambled in the dark
not one of them would ever live to
tell the tale or disembark


brother rose up 'gainst brother
in every circumstance
they fought and slaughtered each other
in a deadly dance


they lowered down the lifeboats
from the sinking wreck
there were traitors, there were turncoats
broken backs and broken necks


the bishop left his cabin
to help all those in need
turned his eyes up to the heavens
said, "the poor are yours to feed"


davey the brothel-keeper
came out dismissed his girls
saw the water getting deeper
saw the changing of his world


jim backus smiled
he never learned to swim
saw the little crippled child
and he gave his seat to him


he saw the starlight shining
streaming from the east
death was on the rampage
but his heart was now at peace


they battened down the hatches
but the hatches wouldn't hold
they drowned upon the staircase
of brass and polished gold


leo said to cleo
i think i'm going mad
but he'd lost his mind already
whatever mind he had


he tried to block the doorway
to save all those from harm
blood from an open wound
pouring down his arm


petals fell from flowers
tell all of them were gone
in the long and dreadful hours
the wizard's curse played on


the host was pouring brandy
he was going down slow
he stayed right to the end and he
was the last to go


there were many, many others
nameless here forever more
they never sailed the ocean
or left their homes before


the watchman, he lay dreaming
the damage had been done
he dreamed the titanic was sinking
and he tried to tell someone


the captain, barely breathing
kneeling at the wheel
above him and beneath him
fifty thousand tons of steel


he looked over at his compass
and he gazed into its face
needle pointing downward
he knew he lost the race


in the dark illumination
he remembered bygone years
he read the book of revelation
and he filled his cup with tears


when the reaper's task had ended
sixteen hundred had gone to rest
the good, the bad, the rich, the poor
the loveliest and the best


they waited at the landing
and they tried to understand
but there is no understanding
for the judgment of god's hand


the news came over the wires
and struck with deadly force
the love had lost its fires
all things had run their course


the watchman he lay dreaming
of all the things that can be
he dreamed the titanic was sinking
into the deep blue sea

it was late last night when the boss came home
to a deserted mansion and a desolate throne
servant said: “boss, the lady’s gone
she left this morning just ‘fore dawn.”


“you got something to tell me, tell it to me, man
come to the point as straight as you can”
“old henry lee, chief of the clan
came riding through the woods and took her by the hand”


the boss he lay back flat on his bed
he cursed the heat and he clutched his head
he pondered the future of his fate
to wait another day would be far too late


“go fetch me my coat and my tie
and the cheapest labour that money can buy
saddle me up my buckskin mare
if you see me go by, put up a prayer”


well, they rode all night, and they rode all day
eastward, long down the broad highway
his spirit was tired and his vision was bent
his men deserted him and onward he went


he came to a place where the light was dull
his forehead pounding in his skull
heavy heart was racked with pain
insomnia raging in his brain


well, he threw down his helmet and his cross-handled sword
he renounced his faith, he denied his lord
crawled on his belly, put his ear to the wall
one way or another put an end to it all


he leaned down, cut the electric wire
stared into the flames and he snorted the fire
peered through the darkness, caught a glimpse of the two
it was hard to tell for certain who was who


he lowered himself down on a golden chain
his nerves were quaking in every vein
his knuckles were bloody, he sucked in the air
he ran his fingers through his greasy hair


they looked at each other and their glasses clinked
one single unit, inseparably linked
“got a strange premonition there’s a man close by”
“don’t worry about him, he wouldn’t harm a fly”


from behind the curtain, the boss he crossed the floor
he moved his feet and he bolted the door
shadows hiding the lines in his face
with all the nobility of an ancient race


she turned, she was startled with a look of surprise
with a hatred that could hit the skies
“you’re a reckless fool, i could see it in your eyes
to come this way was by no means wise”


“get up, stand up, you greedy-lipped wench
and cover your face or suffer the consequence
you are making my heart feel sick
put your clothes back on, double-quick”


“silly boy, you think me a saint
i’ll listen no more to your words of complaint
you’ve given me nothing but the sweetest lies
now hold your tongue and feed your eyes”


“i’d have given you the stars and the planets, too
but what good would these things do you?
bow the heart if not the knee
or never again this world you’ll see”


“oh, please let not your heart be cold
this man is dearer to me than gold”
“oh, my dear, you must be blind
he’s a gutless ape with a worthless mind”


“you’ve had your way too long with me
now it’s me who’ll determine how things shall be”
“try to escape,” he cussed and cursed
‘you’ll have to try to get past me first”


i dare not let your passion rule
you think my heart the heart of a fool
and you, sir, you can not deny
you made a monkey of me, what and for why?”


“i’ll have no more of this insulting chat
the devil can have you, i’ll see to that
look sharp or step aside
or in the cradle you’ll wish you’d died”


the gun went boom and the shot rang clear
first bullet grazed his ear
second ball went right straight in
and he bent in the middle like a twisted pin


he crawled to the corner and he lowered his head
he gripped the chair and he grabbed the bed
it would take more than needle and thread
bleeding from the mouth, he’s as good as dead


“you shot my husband down, you fiend”
“husband? what husband? what the hell do you mean?
he was a man of strife, a man of sin
i cut him down and threw him to the wind”


this she said with angry breath
“you too shall meet the lord of death
it was i who brought your soul to life”
then she raised her robe and she drew out a knife


his face was hard and caked with sweat
his arms ached and his hands were wet
“you’re a murderous queen and a bloody wife
if you don’t mind, i’ll have the knife”


“we’re two of a kind and our blood runs hot
but we’re no way similar in body or thought
all husbands are good men, as all wives know”
then she pierced him to the heart and his blood did flow


his knees went limp and he reached for the door
his tomb was sealed, he slid to the floor
he whispered in her ear: “this is all your fault
my fighting days have come to a halt”


she touched his lips and kissed his cheek
he tried to speak but his breath was weak
“you died for me, now i’ll die for you”
she put the blade to her heart and she ran it through


all three lovers together in a heap
thrown into the grave, forever to sleep
funeral torches blazed away
through the towns and the villages all night and all day
