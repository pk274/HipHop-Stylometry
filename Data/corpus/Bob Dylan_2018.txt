someone’s got it in for me
they’re planting stories in the press
whoever it is i wish they’d cut it
but when they will i can only guess
they say i shot a man named gray
and took his wife to italy
she inherited a million bucks
and when she died it came to me
i can’t help it if i’m lucky


people see me all the time
and they just can’t remember how to act
their minds are filled with big ideas
images and distorted facts
even you, yesterday
you had to ask me where it was at
i couldn’t believe after all these years
you didn’t know me any better than that
sweet lady


idiot wind blowing every time you move your mouth
going down the backroads heading south
idiot wind blowing every time you move your teeth
you’re an idiot, babe, it’s a wonder that you still know how to breathe


i threw the i-ching yesterday
it said there'd be some thunder at the well
i haven't tasted peace and quiet
for so long it seems like living hell
there’s a lone soldier on the hill
watching falling raindrops pour
you'd never know it to look at him
at the final shot he won the war
after losing every battle


i woke up on the roadside
daydreaming about the way things sometimes are
hoofbeats pounding in my head
at break-neck speed and making me see stars
you hurt the ones that i love best
and cover up the truth with lies
one day you’ll be in the ditch
flies buzzing around your eyes
blood on your saddle


idiot wind, blowing through the flowers on your tomb
blowing through the curtains in your room
idiot wind, blowing every time you move your teeth
you’re an idiot, babe, it’s a wonder that you still know how to breathe


it was gravity which pulled us in
and destiny which broke us apart
you tamed the lion in my cage
but it just wasn’t enough to change my heart
now everything’s a little upside down
as a matter of fact the wheels have stopped
what’s good is bad, what’s bad is good
you’ll find out when you reach the top
you’re on the bottom


i noticed at the ceremony
that you left your bags behind
the driver came in after you left
he gave them all to me and then he resigned
the priest wore black on the seventh day
and waltzed around while the building burned
you didn't trust me for a minute babe
i've never known the spring to turn so quickly into autumn


idiot wind blowing every time you move your jaw
from the grand coulee dam to the mardi gras
idiot wind blowing every time you move your teeth
you’re an idiot, babe, it’s a wonder that you still know how to breathe


we pushed each other a little too far
and one day it just turned into a raging storm
the hound dog bayed beyond your trees
as i was packing up my uniform
well, i figured i’d lost you anyway
why go on? what’s the use?
in order to get in a word with you
i’d have had to come up with some excuse
and it just struck me kind of funny


i've been double-crossed too much
at times i think i've almost lost my mind
ladykillers load dice on me
behind my back, while imitators steal me blind
you close your eyes and pout your lip
and slip your fingers from your glove
you can have the best there is
but it's going to cost you all your love
you won't get it for money


idiot wind blowing through the buttons of our coats
blowing through the letters that we wrote
idiot wind blowing through the dust upon our shelves
we’re idiots, babe, it’s a wonder we can even feed ourselves

the festival was over, the boys were all plannin’ for a fall
the cabaret was quiet except for the drillin’ in the wall
the curfew had been lifted and the gamblin’ wheel shut down
anyone with any sense had already left town
he was standin’ in the doorway lookin’ like the jack of hearts


he moved across the mirrored room, “set it up for everyone,” he said
then everyone commenced to do what they were doin’ before he turned their heads
then he walked up to a stranger and he asked him with a grin
“could you kindly tell me, friend, what time the show begins?”
then he moved into the corner, face down like the jack of hearts


backstage the girls were playin’ five-card stud by the stairs
lily had two queens, she was hopin’ for a third to match her pair
outside the streets were fillin’ up, the window was open wide
a gentle breeze was blowin’, you could feel it from inside
lily called another bet and drew up the jack of hearts


big jim was no one’s fool, he owned the town’s only diamond mine
he made his usual entrance lookin’ so dandy and so fine
with his bodyguards and silver cane and every hair in place
he took whatever he wanted to and he laid it all to waste
but his bodyguards and silver cane were no match for the jack of hearts


rosemary combed her hair and took a carriage into town
she slipped in through the side door lookin’ like a queen without a crown
she fluttered her false eyelashes and whispered in his ear
“sorry, darlin’, that i’m late,” but he didn’t seem to hear
he was starin’ into space over at the jack of hearts


“i know i’ve seen that face before,” big jim was thinkin’ to himself
“maybe down in mexico or a picture up on somebody’s shelf”
but then the crowd began to stamp their feet and the houselights did dim
and in the darkness of the room there was only jim and him
starin’ at the butterfly who just drew the jack of hearts


lily was a princess, she was fair-skinned and precious as a child
she did whatever she had to do, she had that certain flash every time she smiled
she’d come away from a broken home, had lots of strange affairs
with men in every walk of life which took her everywhere
but she’d never met anyone quite like the jack of hearts


the hangin’ judge came in unnoticed and was being wined and dined
the drillin’ in the wall kept up but no one seemed to pay it any mind
it was known all around that lily had jim’s ring
and nothing would ever come between lily and the king
no, nothin’ ever would except maybe the jack of hearts


rosemary started drinkin’ hard and seein’ her reflection in the knife
she was tired of the attention, tired of playin’ the role of big jim’s wife
she had done a lot of bad things, even once tried suicide
was lookin’ to do just one good deed before she died
she was gazin’ to the future, riding on the jack of hearts


lily washed her face, took her dress off and buried it away
“has your luck run out?” she laughed at him, “well, i guess you must
have known it would someday
be careful not to touch the wall, there’s a brand-new coat of paint
i’m glad to see you’re still alive, you’re lookin’ like a saint”
down the hallway footsteps were comin’ for the jack of hearts


the backstage manager was pacing all around by his chair
“there’s something funny going on,” he said, “i can just feel it in the air”
he went to get the hangin’ judge, but the hangin’ judge was drunk
as the leading actor hurried by in the costume of a monk
there was no actor anywhere better than the jack of hearts


lily’s arms were locked around the man that she dearly loved to touch
she forgot all about the man she couldn’t stand who hounded her so much
“i’ve missed you so,” she said to him, and he felt she was sincere
but just beyond the door he felt jealousy and fear
just another night in the life of the jack of hearts


no one knew the circumstance but they say that it happened pretty quick
the door to the dressing room burst open and a cold revolver clicked
and big jim was standin’ there, ya couldn’t say surprised
rosemary right beside him, steady in her eyes
she was with big jim but she was leanin’ to the jack of hearts


two doors down the boys finally made it through the wall
and cleaned out the bank safe, it’s said that they got off with quite a haul
in the darkness by the riverbed they waited on the ground
for one more member who had business back in town
but they couldn’t go no further without the jack of hearts


the next day was hangin’ day, the sky was overcast and black
big jim lay covered up, killed by a penknife in the back
and rosemary on the gallows, she didn’t even blink
the hangin’ judge was sober, he hadn’t had a drink
the only person on the scene missin’ was the jack of hearts


the cabaret was empty now, a sign said, “closed for repair”
lily had already taken all of the dye out of her hair
she was thinkin’ ’bout her father, who she very rarely saw
thinkin’ ’bout rosemary and thinkin’ about the law
but most of all she was thinkin’ ’bout the jack of hearts

'twas in another lifetime, one of toil and blood
when blackness was a virtue and the road was full of mud
i came in from the wilderness, a creature void of form
“come in,” she said, “i’ll give you shelter from the storm”


if i pass this way again, you can rest assured
i'll always do my best for her, on that i give my word
in a world of steel-eyed death, and men who are fighting to be warm
“come in,” she said, “i'll give you shelter from the storm”


not a word was spoke between us, there was no risk involved
everything up to that point had been left unresolved
try imagining a place where it’s always safe and warm
“come in,” she said, “i'll give you shelter from the storm”


i was burned out from exhaustion, buried in the hail
poisoned in the bushes an' blown out on the trail
hunted like a crocodile, ravaged in the corn
“come in,” she said, “i'll give you shelter from the storm”


suddenly i turned around and she was standin' there
with silver bracelets on her wrists and flowers in her hair
she walked up to me so gracefully and took my crown of thorns
“come in,” she said, “i'll give you shelter from the storm”


now there's a wall between us, somethin' there’s been lost
i took too much for granted, i got my signals crossed
just to think that it all began on a long-forgotten morn
“come in,” she said, “i’ll give you shelter from the storm”


well, the deputy walks on hard nails and the preacher rides a mount
but nothing really matters much, it's doom alone that counts
and the one-eyed undertaker, he blows a futile horn
“come in,” she said, “i’ll give you shelter from the storm”


well i've heard newborn babies wailin' like a mournin' dove
and old men with broken teeth stranded without love
do i understand your question, man, is it hopeless and forlorn?
“come in,” she said, “i’ll give you shelter from the storm”


in a little hilltop village, they gambled for my clothes
i bargained for salvation, she gave me a lethal dose
i offered up my innocence and got repaid with scorn
“come in,” she said, “i'll give you shelter from the storm”


i'm livin' in a foreign country but i'm bound to cross the line
beauty walks a razor's edge, someday i'll make it mine
if i could only turn back the clock to when god and her were born
“come in,” she said, “i'll give you shelter from the storm”

early one morning the sun was shining
and he was laying in bed
wondering if she'd changed at all
if her hair was still red
her folks they said their lives together
sure was going to be rough
they never did like mama's homemade dress
papa's bankbook wasn't big enough
and he was standing on the side of the road
rain falling on his shoes
heading out for the old east coast
lord knows he's paid some dues
getting through
tangled up in blue


she was married when they first met
soon to be divorced
he helped her out of a jam, i guess
but he used a little too much force
and they drove that car as far as they could
abandoned it out west
and split up on a dark sad night
both agreeing it was best
and she turned around to look at him
as he was walking away
she said "this can't be the end
we'll meet on another day, on the avenue"
tangled up in blue


he had a job in the great north woods
working as a cook for a spell
but he never liked it all that much
and one day the ax just fell
so he drifted down to l.a.
where he reckoned to try his luck
working for a while in an airplane plant
loading cargo onto a truck
but all the while he was alone
the past was close behind
he seen a lot of women
but she never escaped his mind
and he just grew
tangled up in blue


she was working in a topless place
and i stopped in for a beer
i just kept looking at the side of her face
in the spotlight, so clear
and later on, when the crowd thinned out
i was about to do the same
she was standing there, in back of my chair
said to me "what's your name?"
i muttered something underneath my breath
she studied the lines on my face
i must admit, i felt a little uneasy
when she bent down to tie the laces
of my shoes
tangled up in blue


she lit a burner on the stove
and offered me a pipe
"i thought you'd never say hello" she said
"you look like the silent type"
then she opened up a book of poems
and handed it to me
written by an italian poet
from the thirteenth century
and every one of them words rang true
and glowed like burning coal
pouring off of every page
like it was written in my soul
from me to you
tangled up in blue


he was always in a hurry
too busy or too stoned
and everything that she ever planned
just had to be postponed
he thought they were successful
she thought they were blessed
with objects and material things
but i never was impressed
and when it all came crashing down
i became withdrawn
the only thing i knew how to do
was keep on keepin' on like a bird that flew
tangled up in blue


so now i'm going back again
i got to get to her somehow
all the people we used to know
they're an illusion to me now
some are mathematicians
some are doctor's wives
don't know how it all got started
don't know what they're doing with their lives
but me, i'm still on the road
heading for another joint
we always did feel the same
we just saw it from a different point
of view
tangled up in blue

everything went from bad to worse, money never changed a thing
death kept following, tracking us down, at least i heard your bluebird sing
now somebody's got to show their hand, time is an enemy
i know you’re long gone, i guess it must be up to me


if i'd thought about it i never would've done it, i guess i would’ve let it slide
if i'd have paid attention to what others were thinking, the heart inside me would've died
i was just too stubborn to ever be governed by enforced insanity
someone had to reach for the rising star, i guess it was up to me


well, the union central is pulling out and the orchids are in bloom
i've only got me one good shirt left and it smells of stale perfume
in fourteen months i've only smiled once and i didn't do it consciously
somebody's got to find your trail, i guess it must be up to me


it was like a revelation when you betrayed me with your touch
i'd just about convinced myself that nothing had changed that much
the old rounder in the iron mask slipped me the master key
somebody had to unlock your heart, he said it was up to me


well, i watched you slowly disappear down into the officers’ club
i would’ve followed you in the door but i didn't have a ticket stub
so i waited all night ’til the break of day, hoping one of us could get free
when the dawn came over the river bridge, i knew it was up to me


well, the only decent thing i did when i worked as a postal clerk
was to haul your picture down off the wall near the cage where i used to work
was i a fool or not to try to protect your identity?
you looked a little burned out, my friend, i thought it might be up to me


well, i met somebody face to face and i had to remove my hat
she's everything i need and love but i can't be swayed by that
it frightens me, the awful truth of how sweet life can be
but she ain't a-going to make me move, i guess it must be up to me


we heard the sermon on the mount and i knew it was too complex
it didn’t amount to anything more than what the broken glass reflects
when you bite off more than you can chew you pay the penalty
somebody's got to tell the tale, i guess it must be up to me


well, dupree came in pimpin' tonight to the thunderbird café
crystal wanted to talk to him, i had to look the other way
well, i just can't rest without you, love, i need your company
but you ain't a-going to cross the line, i guess it must be up to me


there's a note left in the bottle, you can give it to estelle
she's the one you been wondering about, but there's really nothing much to tell
we both heard voices for a while, now the rest is history
somebody's got to cry some tears, i guess it must be up to me


so go on, boys, and play your hands, life is a pantomime
the ringleaders from the county seat say you don't have all that much time
and the girl with me behind the shades, she ain't my property
one of us has got to hit the road, i guess it must be up to me


and if we never meet again, baby, remember me
how my lone guitar played sweet for you that old-time melody
and the harmonica around my neck, i blew it for you, free
no one else could play that tune, you know it was up to me

i’ve seen love go by my door
it’s never been this close before
never been so easy or so slow
i've been shooting in the dark too long
when something’s not right, it’s wrong
you're gonna make me lonesome when you go


dragon clouds so high above
i’ve only known careless love
it always just hit me from below
but this time 'round it’s more correct
right on target, so direct
you're gonna make me lonesome when you go


purple clover, queen anne lace
crimson hair across your face
you could make me cry, if you don’t know
can’t remember what i was thinking of
you might be spoilin’ me too much, love
you're gonna make me lonesome when you go


flowers on the hillside, bloomin’ crazy
crickets talkin’ back and forth in rhyme
blue river runnin’ slow and lazy
i could stay with you forever and never realize the time


situations have ended sad
relationships have all been bad
mine’ve been like verlaine’s and rimbaud
but there’s no way i can compare
all them scenes to this affair
you're gonna make me lonesome when you go


you're gonna make me wonder what i’m doin’
staying far behind without you
you're gonna make me wonder what i’m sayin’
you're gonna make me give myself a good talking-to


i’ll look for you in old honolulu
san francisco or ashtabula
you're gonna have to leave me now, i know
but i’ll see you in the sky above
in the tall grass, in the ones i love
you're gonna make me lonesome when you go
