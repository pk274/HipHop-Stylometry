black rider, black rider, you've been living too hard
been up all night, have to stay on your guard
the path that you're walking, too narrow to walk
every step of the way, another stumbling block
the road that you're on, same road that you know
just not the same as it was a minute ago


black rider, black rider, you've seen it all
you've seen the great world and you've seen the small
you fell into the fire and you're eating the flame
better seal up your lips if you wanna stay in the game
be reasonable, mister, be honest, be fair
let all of your earthly thoughts be a prayer


black rider, black rider, all dressed in black
i'm walking away, you try to make me look back
my heart is at rest, i'd like to keep it that way
i don't wanna fight, at least not today
go home to your wife, stop visiting mine
one of these days i'll forget to be kind


black rider, black rider, tell me when, tell me how
if there ever was a time, then let it be now
let me go through, open the door
my soul is distressed, my mind is at war
don't hug me, don't flatter me, don't turn on the charm
i'll take a sword and hack off your arm


black rider, black rider, hold it right there
the size of your cock will get you nowhere
i'll suffer in silence, i'll not make a sound
maybe i'll take the high moral ground
some enchanted evening i'll sing you a song
black rider, black rider, you've been on the job too long

i crossed the rubicon on the 14th day
of the most dangerous month of the year
at the worst time, at the worst place
that's all i seem to hear
i got up early
so i can greet the goddess of the dawn
i've painted my wagon, abandoned all hope
and i crossed the rubicon


well, the rubicon is a red river
goin' gently as she flows
redder than your ruby lips
and the blood that flows from the rose
three miles north of purgatory
one step from the great beyond
i prayed to the cross, i kissed the girls
and i crossed the rubicon


what are these dark days i see?
in this world so badly bent
i cannot redeem the time
the time so idly spent
how much longer can it last?
how long can it go on?
i embrace my love, put down my hair
and i crossed the rubicon


i can feel the bones beneath my skin
and they're tremblin' with rage
i'll make your wife a widow
you'll never see old age
show me one good man in sight
that the sun shines down upon
i pawned my watch, i paid my debts
and i crossed the rubicon


put my hide up on a hill
where some happiness i'll find
if i survive, then let me love
let the hour be mine
take the high road, take the low
take any one you're on
i poured the cup, i passed it along
and i crossed the rubicon


well, you defiled the most lovely flowers
in all her womanhood
others can be tolerant
others can be good
i'll cut you up with a crooked knife
lord, and i'll miss you when you're gone
i stood between heaven and earth
and i crossed the rubicon


you won't find any happiness here
no happiness or joy
go back to the gutter, try your luck
find you some nice pretty boy
tell me how many men i need
and who can i count upon
i strapped my belt, i buttoned my coat
and i crossed the rubicon


i feel the holy spirit inside
see the light that freedom gives
i believe it's in the reach of
every man who lives
keep as far away as possible
it's darkest 'fore the dawn (oh lord)
i turned the key, i broke it off
and i crossed the rubicon


mona, baby, are you still in my mind?
i truly believe that you are
couldn't be anybody else but you
who's come with me this far
the killing frost is on the ground
and the autumn leaves are gone
i lit the torch, i looked to the east
and i crossed the rubicon

another day that don't end
another ship goin' out
another day of anger, bitterness, and doubt
i know how it happened
i saw it begin
i opened my heart to the world and the world came in


hello, mary lou
hello, miss pearl
my fleet-footed guides from the underworld
no stars in the sky shine brighter than you
you girls mean business and i do too


well, i'm the enemy of treason
an enemy of strife
i'm the enemy of the unlived meaningless life
i ain't no false prophet
i just know what i know
i go where only the lonely can go


i'm first among equals
second to none
the last of the best
you can bury the rest
bury 'em naked with their silver and gold
put 'em six feet under and i pray for their souls


what are you lookin' at?
there's nothing to see
just a cool breeze that's encircling me
let's go for a walk in the garden
so far and so wide
we can sit in the shade by the fountain-side


i search the world over
for the holy grail
i sing songs of love
i sing songs of betrayal
don't care what i drink
i don't care what i eat
i climb the mountain of swords on my bare feet


you don't know me, darlin'
you never would guess
i'm nothing like my ghostly appearance would suggest
i ain't no false prophet
i just said what i said
i'm just here to bring vengeance on somebody's head


put out your hand
there's nothing to hold
open your mouth
i'll stuff it with gold
oh, you poor devil, look up if you will
the city of god is there on the hill


hello, stranger
hello and goodbye
you ruled the land
but so do i
you lusty old mule
you got a poisoned brain
i'll marry you to a ball and chain


you know, darlin'
the kind of life that i live
when your smile meets my smile
something's got to give
i ain't no false prophet
no, i'm nobody's bride
can't remember when i was born
and i forgot when i died

i live on a street named after a saint
women in the churches wear powder and paint
where the jews, and catholics, and the muslims all pray
i can tell they're proddie from a mile away
goodbye jimmy reed, jimmy reed indeed
give me that old time religion, it's just what i need


for thine is kingdom, the power, the glory
go tell it on the mountain, go tell the real story
tell it in that straightforward, puritanical tone
in the mystic hours when a person's alone
goodbye jimmy reed, godspeed
thump on the bible, proclaim a creed


you won't amount to much, the people all said
'cause i didn't play guitar behind my head
never pandered, never acted proud
never took off my shoes, throw 'em in the crowd
goodbye jimmy reed, goodbye, goodnight
put a jewel in your crown and i put out the lights


they threw everything at me, everything in the book
i had nothing to fight with but a butcher's hook
they had no pity, they never lend a hand
i can't sing a song that i don't understand
goodbye jimmy reed, goodbye, good luck
i can't play the record 'cause my needle got stuck


transparent woman in a transparent dress
suits you well, i must confess
i'll break open your grapes, i'll suck out the juice
i need you like my head needs a noose
goodbye jimmy reed, goodbye and so long
i thought i could resist her but i was so wrong


god be with you, brother dear
if you don't mind me asking what brings you here?
oh, nothing much, i'm just looking for the man
need to see where he's lying in this lost land
goodbye jimmy reed, and everything within ya
can't you hear me calling from down in virginia?

mckinley hollered, mckinley squalled
doctor said, "mckinley, death is on the wall
‪say it to me, if you got something to confess"
‪i heard all about it, he was going down slow ‬
‪i heard it on the wireless radio ‬
‪from down in the boondocks way down in key west
‪i’m searching for love, for inspiration ‬
‪on that pirate radio station
‪coming out of luxembourg and budapest ‬
‪radio signal, clear as can be
‪i'm so deep in love that i can hardly see ‬
‪down on the flatlands, way down in key west


‪key west is the place to be ‬
‪if you're looking for immortality ‬
‪stay on the road, follow the highway sign ‬
‪key west is fine and fair
‪if you lost your mind, you will find it there
‪key west is on the horizon line


‪i was born on the wrong side of the railroad track
‪like ginsberg, corso and kerouac
‪like louis and jimmy and buddy and all the rest ‬
‪well, it might not be the thing to do ‬
‪but i'm sticking with you through and through ‬
‪down in the flatlands, way down in key west
‪i got both my feet planted square on the ground ‬
‪got my right hand high with the thumb down ‬
‪such is life, such is happiness
‪hibiscus flowers, they grow everywhere here
‪if you wear one, put it behind your ear
‪down in the bottom, way down in key west ‬


‪key west is the place to go
‪down by the gulf of mexico ‬
‪beyond the sea, beyond the shifting sand

‪i've never lived in the land of oz ‬
‪or wasted my time with an unworthy cause ‬
‪it’s hot down here, and you can't be overdressed
‪tiny blossoms of a toxic plant ‬
‪they can make you dizzy, i'd like to help you but i can't
‪down in the flatlands, way down in key west ‬
‪well, the fishtail palms, and the orchid trees
‪they can give you that bleeding heart disease
‪people tell me i ought to try a little tenderness ‬
‪on amelia street, bayview park ‬
‪walking in the shadows after dark ‬
‪down under, way down in key west ‬
‪i played gumbo limbo spirituals

‪people tell me that i'm truly blessed ‬
bougainvillea blooming in the summer, in the spring
winter here is an unknown thing
down in the flat lands, way down in key west


key west is under the sun, under the radar, under the gun
you stay to the left, and then you lean to the right
feel the sunlight on your skin, and the healing virtues of the wind
key west, key west is the land of light


wherever i travel, wherever i roam
i'm not that far from the convent home
i do what i think is right, what i think is best
mystery street off of mallory square
truman had his white house there
east bound, west bound, way down in key west
twelve years old, they put me in a suit
forced me to marry a prostitute
there were gold fringes on her wedding dress
that's my story, but not where it ends
she's still cute, and we're still friends
down on the bottom, way down in key west
i play both sides against the middle
trying to pick up that pirate radio signal
i heard the news, i heard your last request
fly around, my pretty little miss
i don't love nobody, give me a kiss
down on the bottom, way down in key west


key west is the place to be
if you're looking for immortality
key west is paradise divine
key west is fine and fair
if you lost your mind, you'll find it there
key west is on the horizon line

'twas a dark day in dallas, november '63
a day that will live on in infamy
president kennedy was a-ridin' high
good day to be livin' and a good day to die
being led to the slaughter like a sacrificial lamb
he said, "wait a minute, boys, you know who i am?"
"of course we do, we know who you are"
then they blew off his head while he was still in the car
shot down like a dog in broad daylight
was a matter of timing and the timing was right
you got unpaid debts, we've come to collect
we're gonna kill you with hatred, without any respect
we'll mock you and shock you and we'll grin in your face
we've already got someone here to take your place
the day they blew out the brains of the king
thousands were watching, no one saw a thing
it happened so quickly, so quick, by surprise
right there in front of everyone's eyes
greatest magic trick ever under the sun
perfectly executed, skillfully done
wolfman, oh wolfman, oh wolfman, howl
rub-a-dub-dub, it's a murder most foul


hush, little children, you'll understand
the beatles are comin', they're gonna hold your hand
slide down the banister, go get your coat
ferry 'cross the mersey and go for the throat
there's three bums comin' all dressed in rags
pick up the pieces and lower the flags
i'm goin' to woodstock, it's the aquarian age
then i'll go over to altamont and sit near the stage
put your head out the window, let the good times roll
there's a party going on behind the grassy knoll
stack up the bricks, pour the cement
don't say dallas don't love you, mr. president
put your foot in the tank and then step on the gas
try to make it to the triple underpass
blackface singer, whiteface clown
better not show your faces after the sun goes down
up in the red light district, like a cop on the beat
living in a nightmare on elm street
when you're down on deep ellum, put your money in your shoe
don't ask what your country can do for you
cash on the barrelhead, money to burn
dealey plaza, make a left-hand turn
i'm going down to the crossroads, gonna flag a ride
the place where faith, hope, and charity died
shoot him while he runs, boy, shoot him while you can
see if you can shoot the invisible man
goodbye, charlie, goodbye, uncle sam
frankly, miss scarlett, i don't give a damn
what is the truth, and where did it go?
ask oswald and ruby, they oughta know
"shut your mouth," said a wise old owl
business is business, and it's a murder most foul


tommy, can you hear me? i'm the acid queen
i'm riding in a long, black lincoln limousine
ridin' in the back seat next to my wife
headed straight on in to the afterlife
i'm leaning to the left, i got my head in her lap
oh lord, i've been led into some kind of a trap
where we ask no quarter, and no quarter do we give
we're right down the street, from the street where you live
they mutilated his body and they took out his brain
what more could they do? they piled on the pain
but his soul was not there where it was supposed to be at
for the last fifty years they've been searchin' for that
freedom, oh freedom, freedom over me
i hate to tell you, mister, but only dead men are free
send me some lovin', then tell me no lie
throw the gun in the gutter and walk on by
wake up, little susie, let's go for a drive
cross the trinity river, let's keep hope alive
turn the radio on, don't touch the dials
parkland hospital, only six more miles
you got me dizzy, miss lizzy, you filled me with lead
that magic bullet of yours has gone to my head
i'm just a patsy like patsy cline
never shot anyone from in front or behind
i've blood in my eye, got blood in my ear
i'm never gonna make it to the new frontier
zapruder's film, i've seen that before
seen it thirty-three times, maybe more
it's vile and deceitful, it's cruel and it's mean
ugliest thing that you ever have seen
they killed him once and they killed him twice
killed him like a human sacrifice
the day that they killed him, someone said to me, "son
the age of the antichrist has just only begun"
air force one comin' in through the gate
johnson sworn in at 2:38
let me know when you decide to throw in the towel
it is what it is, and it's murder most foul


what's new, pussycat? what'd i say?
i said the soul of a nation been torn away
and it's beginning to go into a slow decay
and that it's thirty-six hours past judgment day
