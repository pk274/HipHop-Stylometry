runnin' with my brothers, headed for the homebase
with a steady pace on the face that just reads race
the road ahead goes on and on
the shit is gettin' longer than the mutherfuckin' marathon
runnin' on but never runnin' out
stayin' wired and if i get tired, i can still try out
hitchhikin' if that's what it gotta do
but nobody's pickin' up a nigga witta attitude
confused, yo but dre's a nigga with nuthin' to lose
one of the few who's been accused and abused
of the crime of poisonin' young minds
but you don't know shit til you been in my shoes
and dre is back from the c-p-t
droppin' some shit that's d-o-p-e
so fuck the p-o-l-i-c-e!
and any mutherfucker that disagrees
stuck and runnin' hard, hauling ass
'cause i been a nigga known for havin' a notorious past
my mind was slick - my temper was too quick
now the fbi's all over my dick


clouds are dark and brothers are hidin'
dick-tricklin' at the sunny mutherfucker's are ridin'
started with five and, yo, one couldn't take it
so now there's four 'cause the fifth couldn't make it
the number's even - now i'm leavin'
we're never gettin' took by a bitch with a weave in
her and the troops are right behind me
but they're so fuckin' stupid, they'll never find me
