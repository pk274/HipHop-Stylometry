and so on, let the shit flow on
because i need somethin' to go off on
the mothafuckin' d-r-e servin' a death wish
so i'mma hit you like this
early in the morning, hop into the b-en-z
i got 44 ways of gettin' paid
sittin' in my lap as i roll off the compton blocks
to scoop up ren, i heard shots
1, 2, 3, then i seen a nigga
hoppin' the fence and it was ren on the mothafuckin' trigger
he got in the benz and said
"dre, i was speakin' to yo' bitch o'shea‚Äù
and as we roll on, i seen the patroller creep
so we got ghost before they peeped
me and ren in a black ce, yo
bumpin' some funky shit by the d.o.c
i gotta get paid, paid in a hurry, see
i got a have it if i'm not paid thoroughly
i start takin', makin' sure my shit is steady bumpin'
a nigga always into somethin'


yeah, the world's most dangerous group
definitely in this mothafucka
sendin' a shout-out to all the bitches out there
yo, you can get the pick up to suck a dick up 'til you hiccup
you know what i'm sayin'


yo, cause i'm a nigga for life
and i really don't give a fuck
i'm goin' for mine, every time
i see a fuckin' softy, punk strong as coffee
a nigga like that best to back up off me
yo, cause these are the days and the times of the real niggas
false niggas, end up as tossed niggas
and that's on the real, cause i'm a nigga that kills
again and again, so tell 'em what's up ren
