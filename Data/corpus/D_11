and so on, let the beat flow on
because i need something to go off on
the one and only d-r-e servin' a death wish
so i'mma hit you like this
early in the morning, hop into the b-en-z
i got 44 ways of getting paid
sitting in my lap as i roll off the compton blocks
to scoop up ren, i heard shots
1-2-3, then i seen ren
hopping the fence and with the .45 inside his hand
he ran to the benz, got in and said
"dre, i was speaking to your girl o'shea"
and as we roll on, i seen the patroller creep
so we got ghost before they peeped
me and ren in a black ce, yo
bumping some funky tracks by the d.o.c
i gotta get paid, paid in a hurry, see
i got a habit if i'm not paid thoroughly
i start takin', makin' sure the money is steady coming
because i'm always into something


yo, because i'm in it for life
and in the beginning i was stacking
now everyone wanna jack-in
watching a softy, punk strong as coffee
a brother like that best to back up off me
yo, cause these are the days and the times of the real g
you cross me, you getting tossed see
and that's on the real, cause i'm know to get ill
again and again, so tell them what's up ren
