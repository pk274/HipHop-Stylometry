guess who's back again
straight out the c.p.t
d.o.c. d.r.e
y'all know me wit the shit bangin'
i'm in the streets again
this west coast shit gettin' played again
its a new season and
a lot of people waitin'
a lot of niggas hatin'
whole lot of stipulation
it's dre makin the beats
puttin' riders on the floor
i gets dope i'm the aftermath c.e.o
half the world wanna see me flow
the other half wanna see me go
it won't happen muthafuckas
dre still rappin muthafuckas
the streets still love him
paid in full since "deep cover"
all three speakers still drumming
beats still coming
comptons version of "feel drumming"
same dre different strokes
same six-tre different spokes
same chronic just different smoke
