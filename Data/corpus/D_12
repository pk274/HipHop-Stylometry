damn, why the fuck are they after me? maybe 'cause i'm a bastard?
or maybe 'cause of the way my hair grow naturally?
still tryna figure out why the fuck i'm full of rage
i think i noticed this bullshit right around the fifth grade
paraphernalia in my locker right next to the switchblade
nothin' but pussy on my mind and some plans of gettin' paid
but i'm a product of the system, raised on government aid
and i knew just how to react when it was time for that raid
just a young black man from compton, wonderin', 'who could save us?'
and could barely read the sentences the justice system gave us
so many rental cars with bricks, i think they probably funded avis
some of us was imbalanced but some us used our talents, shit
not all of us criminals but cops be yellin', "stay back, nigga!"
we need a little bit of payback (payback!)
don't treat me like an animal 'cause all this shit is flammable
don't fuck around 'cause when it's done, it's done
fuck you!


yeah! this is dj motherfuckin' premier!
and i'm dr. dre (dr. dre)
what, premo! yeah, we fuckin' shit up!
no! we don't play no games here! motherfucker, please!
aftermath
one of the reasons that me and you click
we don't lose, i always win
let's face it, you basic, boy, for realla, for realla
professional winners!
for realla, for realla
