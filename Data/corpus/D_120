i'm down for the action, he smart with his mouth, so smack him (woo)
you holding a strap, he might come back, so clap him (yeah)
react like a gangsta, or die like a gangsta for acting (c'mon)
'cause you'll get hit and homicide'll be asking, "what happened?"
oh no, look who crept in with the .44
twenty-inch rims sitting on low-pros (uh-huh)
east side, west side, niggas know, yo, i'm loco (yeah)
even my mama said something really wrong with my brain
niggas don't rob me, they know i'm down to die for my chain
g-unit (yeah), we get it popping in the hood
g-unit (yeah), motherfucker, what's good?
i'm waiting on niggas to act like they don't know how to act (uh-huh)
after sippin' too much jack, i'll blow 'em off the map
with the mac, thinking it's all rap
'til that ass get clapped and doc say, "it's a wrap" (it's a wrap, nigga)
