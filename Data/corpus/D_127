but this is what the fuck is up, doin' this for my city
comp-town, hub, this my fuckin' committee
shout out to dub c, real nigga been with me
c-walkin' on these niggas with a crease in them dickies
you know how many nights i heard them sparks echo in the park?
around this time, i was spinnin' records at eve after dark
my city crazy, school girls used to play with that chalk
same chalk police used to outline niggas we lost
you understand what i'm sayin'? shit is crazy, man
fuck the money, yo, this shit could never change me, man
these new niggas in this bitch could never phase me, man
i know it's strange, but on some real shit, it's plain as day
i'm just havin' some fuckin' fun with this rap shit
nigga with an attitude, still gettin' active
man, this industry to me, it feels a little plastic
i ain't heard nothin' that i can consider classic, ugh
but this is for my niggas who been runnin' with me (runnin' with me)
and everybody in this bitch that's out there gunnin' for me (gunnin' for me)
and i got love for my people that stay one hundred with me
i'ma keep it a1, been that way since day one


drama make it cinematic (yeah)
all i think about is makin' classics
tragic, massive, for the masses
this how you make a motherfuckin' classic (classic)
cl— cl— classic
