yeah i wanna give a dedication to this record right here, to my favorite girl, i mean you mean so much to me. you're special...i mean when i'm feelin' low, you get me high. i love you, i love you boo, it's real


despite i gotta wife, you the girl of my life
i gotta hit u in the mornin', afternoon and night
i like when you stimulate, all of my feelin's
i like when you light up the scene, when i'm chillin'
if a nigga hold you too long, i'll kill 'em
to you my deepest thoughts i reveala
if you runnin', i loosen the tips then i reseal em
i love you, you love me, ain't no puzzle
and my boo know too, so you know i got you covered
everytime i hit you girl, it feels like know other
i had to take a deep breathe and reminisce
heaven must be like this


you the, only, one that i could ever kill fo, i gotta get more
you the, only, one that i could ever live fo, it's you i adore
you the, only, one that i could ever kill fo, i gotta get more
you the, only, one that i could ever live fo, it's you i adore


i sit alone in my four corner room playin' dreamcast
hittin' you up inside of steamed glass
it's not your face or your soft act
it's the way you make me feel, and thats way real
alotta fools talk about you but they don't even know
they ain't hittin' you, they hittin' your kinfolk pretend-o
she smoke suckas out, they pull their duckets out
but she don't have what you worth, dig what i'm talkin bout?
i met you at my uncle rick james house, he told me you turned me out
and ever since that first hit i can't take you out my mouth
and when i do a press conference, you right with me
when i'm on stage, you right with me
i'll be there for you, cause you be there for me
i care for you, i really hope you care for me


you the, only, one that i could ever kill fo, i gotta get more
you the, only, one that i could ever live fo, it's you i adore
you the, only, one that i could ever kill fo, i gotta get more
you the, only, one that i could ever live fo, it's you i adore

you the, only, one that i could ever kill fo, i gotta get more
you the, only, one that i could ever live fo, it's you i adore
you the, only, one that i could ever kill fo, i gotta get more
you the, only, one that i could ever live fo, it's you i adore


i carefully flip back the sheets and put you in the middle
like bread to me, and grab the heat, and put it right to your lips
and blaze you up, now a nigga really feelin' ya shit
sit in my seat, and try to put a rhyme to this beat
but like a nut, when i'm through with you, i gotta go eat
fall asleep, wake up in the mornin and you're still next to me
i'm in ecstasy
and you're aroma stuck on my like sex to me
pretty girl, my wife think i'm crazy
cause i wake up in the middle of the night to go hit you baby
in the garage, right on the side of the mercedes
we'd glide, slide, bumpin that snoop dogg's latest
i'm really glad to say this
mary j, that seems so plain
sunshine that's your new thang, cause you do thangs, yea yea


you the, only, one that i could ever kill fo, i gotta get more
you the, only, one that i could ever live fo, it's you i adore
you the, only, one that i could ever kill fo, i gotta get more
you the, only, one that i could ever live fo, it's you i adore
