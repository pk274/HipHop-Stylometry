hittman, 2000

comin' in stompin', it's hitt from bronson
in collaboration with dre from compton
huh, i came to say a lil sumthin' (hittman, 2000)
hittman, at your service
highly intensive tongue talents makin' all nervous
y'all fakin', i'm 409, with my rhymes all purpose
y'all hatin', popped up with dre y'all nervous
y'all waitin', anticipatin'
my arrival california survivalist
smash on any man rival this
blast on anyone who don't ride with hitt
y'all betta buy my shit
i said "buy", not "bite" my shit
rappin' since '85, think i don't write my shit?
bitch, get off my dick!
