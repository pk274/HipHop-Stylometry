hey... hey, whassup?
my name is dre
can i blaze some chronic witchu?
(nigga, what? fo' sho'!
roll that shit up!)
hell yeah


still always into something, heart still in compton
the comp can't oppose, dope cali platinum classicals
introduced you to my doggs, that don't love hoes
and firm fiascoesâ€”assholes
fucked you up with my last video, tuxed up
doing a tango
and cash, always in my grasp
came up in the game wearin' khakis not kangols, stranglin' hoes
when asked about it in most interviews i just laugh
now i vacate with hoes with a gang of ass
one feedin' me mangoes, the other lightin' my hash
rap tabloids write dre's light in the ass (what?)
came home uptight, ready to mash
like a gas pedal, get on that '64 chevy level
ak-47 heavy metal
who say dre ain't ghetto? just whistle like a tea kettle
i throw three at you, tell me if you see devils
'cause we rebels over here, i smell chronic in the air
that means we takin' over this year
you hear?


chronic, 2000
"one!"
that means we takin' over this year, ya hear?
