listen, this is my evaluation
this shit oversaturated, y'all can get evacuated
kids sippin' actavis and they ain't even activated
married to the internet, stuck in place, salivatin'
ain't nobody graduatin'
don't nobody love this shit the way i love it
that's why i gotta hate it
everybody out for fame, that ain't no exaggeration
damn, i'm gettin' aggravated
fuck, i'm gettin' agitated
teachers so underpaid in these fuckin' schools
the police got our name in all they databases
girls be thirteen actin' twenty-two
niggas be forty-four actin' half they ages
somebody tell me, what the fuck is goin' on?
these niggas in tight shit, i'm in the fuckin' matrix
it's lookin' like a sign of the revelation
'bout time of the return of the fuckin' greatest
i got all these patients, man
how come they ain't patient with me?
they just think i want the money
why? when i can't take it with me
y'all don't do it for the love, for the love not
they gon' find out who you are
just admit it 'fore you get admitted
