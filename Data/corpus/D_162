how many niggas can say they got they own...
...got they shit together, got a a nice stash to do whatever?
ah, you're sittin at home
hatin on the next man that's makin cheddar
tryin to get his shit together
i dreamed of hittin licks when i first got in the mix
way back when dj's was heavy in the crates for breaks
and ain't a damn thing changed
but me movin out the firin range to a plushed out estate
small technicalities y'all heard for years
niggas with the problems always out to battle me
but i gets my swerve on, don't give a fuck
it's just a nigga talkin shit about his bullshit salary
