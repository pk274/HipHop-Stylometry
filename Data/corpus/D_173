hi, kids! do you like primus? (yeah, yeah)
wanna see me stick nine inch nails through each one of my eyelids? (uh-huh)
wanna copy me and do exactly like i did? (oh?)
try 'cid and get messed up worse than my life is?
my brain's dead weight, i'm trying to get my head straight
but i can't figure out which spice girl i want to impregnate (oh)
and dr. dre said "slim shady, you a basehead" (uh-uh)
"so why's your face red? man, you wasted!"
well, since age twelve, i felt like a caged elf
who stayed to himself in one space, chasing his tail
got ticked off and ripped pamela lee's lips off
kissed 'em and said, "i ain't know silicone was supposed to be this soft!"
i'm 'bout to pass out and crash, and fall in the grass
faster than the fat man who sat down too fast
come here, lady! "shady, wait a minute, that's my girl, dawg!"
i don't give a damn, dre sent me to tick the world off
