yeah
not many days left (bring that shit)


too much stress can make a nigga hesitate with no time left
(i feel blessed though)
here we go to the next
a dr. dre exclusive with music bruising your neck (what the fuck?)
rip your plans up, dre's ruling
you don't want to fuck around with the hands, let alone the gun foolin'
like de la had niggas plug tunin'
me and l had niggas zooming, me and snoop flew the coup
me keep your asses moving, with that hot shit
club niggas like to request this around-the-clock shit
but i do it for my (hood niggas)
with rockets
who learned how to survive and fatten them pockets
with 'x' amount of dollars the ballers, crime pays
but that snake shit'll leave that ass in a pine grave
rocking project halls, from your sound-proof stalls
got all you motherfuckers screaming "yes yes y'all"
