a-yo, let's take it to the street (word up)
let 'em understand perfection
let knowledge be the tool for suckas to stop guessin'
'cause i don't give a fuck about radio play
observe the english i display
lyrics for the adults, children have been barred
and scarred from listenin' to somethin' so muthafuckin' hard
dope! pumpin' that's so my shit will never falter
yo, it's dre! so fuck the "mind of minolta"!
psycho like no other muthafucka
so step to me wrong — g-o for what you n-o!
but be warned — never will i leave like a regular
'cause i'm a little better than the regular competitor
i used to see 'em on stage
earnin' money like a thief, but without a gauge
until i got full of clockin' the lame, gettin' pull
(they said you wasn't gon' get paid) nah, that's bullshit!
they like it stylistic, and i enchant the crowd like i'm a mystic
(c-c-c-c) c-c-c-cameras are flashin' when i'm in action
a photo, or fresh with the flair for fashion
pure simplicity — see, it's elementary
you hear one of the hardest muthafuckaz this century
try to comprise a word to the wise and they guys
parental discretion is advised
