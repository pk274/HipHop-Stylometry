it's been awhile since you've heard these beats
you're malnourished
but he's back now, to flood these streets
they shall flourish
others try but they lack courage
in fact, this track was on the back burner, it leaked
so back to the lab i had to go
but it was too magical, so
here, doctor smack a ho's back, ask if it's tactical, (sure is)
girl, i hope your vaginal has endurance
cause i'm about to do somethin' tragical
rest assure this
cause homie hit the oe flow, you know me from before
but you don't know me like this, so do see do
get on top of me and ride it like a rodeo, ho
i'll have you od'ing on dick, this belong to your soul
felonious, i'll kill your loneliness
but only just for, one night
yeah that was fun, right? but i gotta go
i got a bottle of mo and fo' mo' lil' mommy's
lookin' like models, waitin' at the do' inside of my ho-tel
all ready to swallow and yo, follow the flow and traffic to the top flo'
and you gonna smell a lot of merlot, a lot of chronic for sho'
gin and tonic sold from the top to the bottom, let's go


order some more bottles, come on momma
would you like a drink on me?
to me it's no problem if you wanna, baby come and drink with me
she take it off at the do', she take it off for the do'
get that ass on the flo', go, go
to me, there's no problem if you wanna, baby come drink with me


order some more bottles, come on momma
would you like a drink on me? (drinks on me)
to me it's no problem if you wanna (baby come and drink with me)
she take it off at the do', she take it off for the do'
get that ass on the flo', go, go
to me, there's no problem if you wanna, baby come drink with me
you can have the time of your life, it's alright
make it a night to remember (remember), how couldn't you remember? (remember)
you can have the time of your life, it's alright
