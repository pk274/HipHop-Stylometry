yo, what’s up, niggas and niggettes?
n.w.a is back in this motherfucker
and this is only the single
wait until the motherfucking album comes out
we gone have some more of that good shit
the shit you just can’t fuck with
but yo, we ain’t finished, tell 'em what’s up man
yo man, there’s a gang of motherfuckers out there on the dick, man
in every motherfuckin' state
wanna be like, wanna look like, wanna act like
wanna dress like, wanna sound like motherfuckin' style stealin'
clone ass n.w.a bitin' ass motherfuckin' everywhere man
non-reality seein', non-reality feelin'
non-reality livin' ass motherfuckers man
hey, i don’t know, reality, it’s important to me, man
so fellas man, tell these niggas what it’s like in the minds of real niggas


first come, first serve, whoever's got the nerve
step up and get what you deserve
from the word of a motherfucking hip-hop maniac
brainiac, so what you oughta do is step the fuck back
now how the fuck you think a rap will last?
wit your ass saying shit that is said in the past
yo, be original, your shit is sloppy
get off the dick you motherfucking carbon copy


yo, giving what i gotta give, doing what i gotta do
you don't care for me, so who gives a fuck about you?
you can't harm me, alarm me
'cause we're the generals in this fucking hip-hop army
the niggas wit attitudes if you didn't know
we blow, flow and getting loose slow from the get go, yo
titles are taken
yo, fuck this shit, yella, kick the break in


all these niggas wit the jibber jabber
but couldn't kill a fly wit a motherfucking sledge hammer
gangstas in black are out there
but only because, yo, it’s the shit that we wear
on my motherfucking dick
but i'ma love it when you drop like a motherfucking brick
so, yo, step off, go to bed, cause if you're mislead
you get a motherfucking bullet in your forehead

lost in a motherfucking world of madness
sadness, but dre is just a nigga that glad there's
sucka motherfuckers like you, making wack jams
because it only shows you how dope i am
never try to ignore us
when i'm expressing, stand still like you're full of rigor mortis
'cause i'm a real nigga, but i guess you'll figure
you can break me, take me, but watch me pull the trigger
dre is just a nigga with heart, a nigga that's smart
a nigga that’s paid to say what others are scared to play
we started out wit too much cargo
so i'm glad we got rid of benedict arnold
yo, n.w.a, criticized for what we say
but i'ma do the shit anyway
'cause i'm the motherfucking doctor, never faking
yo, yella, kick the motherfucking break in
