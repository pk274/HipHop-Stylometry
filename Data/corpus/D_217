yeah
yo, let's bring it


niggas is so gangsta, niggas is thugs
niggas'll spend they whole life peddling drugs
slangin' dope in hopes of one day being able
to own their own label and give the game up
some niggas came up, some just didn't
that's just the way it is; if it ain't meant it, it just isn't
some niggas'll get money and pay niggas to back 'em so they can act up, feel comfortable and rap tough
and that's ass-backwards
'cause them niggas just gon' keep comin' back and that's when extortion happens and you struggle to get free
i know how this shit be
you'd give anything to live legitimately
but you gon' find if you do get in this industry
it's best to do business with me than against me
niggas get behind mics and ain't even emcees
niggas get on mtv just to diss me
this shit don't even piss me off
i'm laughing all the way to the bank
watching the satellite from a bentley
and you niggas ain't even got a car
you're so far under my radar
i don't even know who the fuck you are
to tell you to suck my dick while i'm pissin'
i don't even listen to your shit to know who the fuck i'm dissin'
and media just feeds into these feuds
tryna add fuel to the fire, this lil' nigga ja rule
talking bout he's gon' slap me? nigga, please!
you gotta jump and swing up to hit me in the knees
i laugh at these magazines when they interview him
all they doing is making fake threats to us through them
and, pussy, you not pac; i knew him
pac was a real nigga, you just a fucking insult to him
it's too bad we had to fall out before he passed
'cause if he could see this shit now, he'd be whoopin' your ass
you're talkin' to a pioneer who engineered this shit for 19 years
who you got in ya ear? (pshhhhh!)
i ain't even gotta say it, the fans know
quit tryna be tough, nigga, you look like an asshole
