see a party ain't a party til the doc walk in it
it's hard to get it started til i hopped off in it
then it got so crunk one minute
since you didn't get to witness, just listen
i came in hot, and then i saw
as soon as i arrived then the shit popped off
the shit popped off
it's officially a gangsta party
you can leave, man she came to party
then the shit popped off (alright)
the shit popped off (alright)
the shit popped off (alright)
said the shit popped off
niggas hands in the air, bitches takin' tops off
put the chronic in the air, and the shit popped off
the shit popped off


late california night, out chillin' i'm
bout to fall up in the club we just killin time
dro blowin', on patron with a hint of lime
6-4 to the front door with top down
hit the switches, the ignition, then hopped out
crew walked in, shut the whole block down
now, hit the door like "god damn
hey is a party, ain't it? man i don't understand
why bitches over here, and niggas over there
the atmosphere so square, people so scared
to get up off the wall, and get up off they ass
to walk up on a broad, and get up on her ass"
i commandeer the turntable, that's my first mission
because the dj ain't spinnin' he bullshittin'
go from california love into doggystyle
bought out the bar hours, pulled out the starter now
