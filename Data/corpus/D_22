they've been wondering if i'm gon' show
shit, you already know-ow-ow-ow
where you been? where you at? where you headed?
this shit started to disappear, oh no-o-o-o
i'm right here, yeah
shit, right back to the basics
sound like i'm right back in the basement
tryna put my neighborhood on
six in the morning (yeah, six in the morning)
until six in the morning (best believe i'm on it)
man i'm working so hard
when the check hit the bank, shit, i ain't even notice
i live in the future
i'm blind to the moment
i, i, you ain't gotta say
oh you ain't gotta lay around, we own it


and i remember when i was young, just a front runner
i was fucking with them drums like every summer
homies couldn't make it out the hood, make a nigga wonder
but i couldn't let compton take a nigga under
no way, no how, can't stop
had, bigger dreams for this hip-hop
i'm happy, it was music and not ziplocs
and now we, bringing crowds like it's woodstock
i might as well wipe down the crown i done put up in the attic
i don't play around, lotta niggas coming through the door
not too many stay around
lot of artists made it, yeah, god damn man i made a sound
oh you ain't never seen a legend do it? hold up, homie wait around
i've been on the verge since a nigga put it down
and if we talking numbers, fuck billboard charts
so they can start with the bank accounts


i've been away
but i see y'all still ain't catch us
anything you do can't impress us
i won't let up on it
they gonna say
anything because they hate us
and the fact that they can't break us
i will never let up
i'm going, yeah i'm going
(i'm going, better believe i'm going) ohh
(i'm going) ohh
it's time to get back to business
