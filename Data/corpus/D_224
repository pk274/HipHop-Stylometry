ah yeah, yo, ren, you ready to do this?
yeah, dre, let's rip it up
ayo, yella boy, won't you kick me that funky beat right here
yo, we got my homeboy eazy-e in the house
compton's definitely in the house
ayo ren, what we gon' call this - "tell 'em what your name is"?
yeah, somethin' like that
well, let's do this on the one, right here


back by demand, and it wasn't luck
because you as the public, you should know what's up
"compton's n the house" was more than gold, it was a hit
'cause it was based on a gangsta tip
so our final conclusion has been permitted
punks made us a target and knew that we'd hit it
but that was a part of showbiz
ayo, homeboy, why don't you tell 'em what your name is


well, for the record, it's ren, and for the street, it's villain
and strapped with a gat, it's more like matt dillon
on "gunsmoke," but not a man of the law
i'm just the baddest black brother that you ever saw
see, i peep, and then i creep on a fool
get my blood pressure high, but still stay cool
dig a grave of the sucker lookin' up to me
that really had the nerve that he could step to me
who was the man in the mask? well, i was waitin' to ask
you know, it's mc ren gettin' ready to blast
gettin' respect in showbiz
ayo homeboy (what's up?)
won't you tell 'em what your name is?


dre, the one and only doctor, skeezer hopper
the sucker duck brother stopper
back with a vocal track that's a fresh one
so now, let's go ahead and get the session
goin', flowin', it's time to start throwin' rhymes
so keep in mind all the suckers i'm blowin'
'cause i'ma start showin' the time
never sayin' i'm the best, i'm just goin' for mine
unlike a lotta suckers who claim they're gettin' busy
when their records only make good frisbees
you need to quit runnin' off the mouth
stop and think, before you put some whack - out
it's not difficult, in fact, it's kinda simple
to create something funky that's original
you either talkin' 'bout the place to be
who you are, what you got, or about a sucker mc


ah yeah, you know what i'm talkin' about, ren
yeah, i know what you're talkin' about, dre
but i still don't think they know what you're talkin' about
alright, alright
well, let's kick another verse right here on the one, alright?
right here? you ready?
kick it


this is portable, something to flow through your ear
ren and dre will appear when the sound is clear
to hype it up like we always do, and that's the trick
sayin' some lyrics that make the girls wanna ride our tips
but it's an everyday thang
communicating to y'all with the compton slang
compton's back in the house and your apartment
so open your door, by the way, so we can start it
test the monitors and call this mic
'cause the way we feel, we're gonna rip it up tonight
i got my mic in my hand, with a hell of a grip
girls screamin' and thangs, now it's a trip
waitin' for the grand finale, or the end
or stupid rhymes said by dre and ren
well, like a kid, we get new shoes and go faster
smilin', like hell, as we move past the
suckers, the dumb brothers with the ego hype
when we're positive and they're on a negative type
and if think we're about to quit
i suggest you get off the tip


ah yeah
yo, this is mc ren and dr. dre, kickin' it in the place
ah yeah, you know that
we got my mellow ice cube in the house
dj yella providing the beat
eazy-e in the house
ayo, i wanna say "what's up" to my homeboys from cmw
we got laylaw and timmy t cold coolin' in the place, word
yeah, ooh, ooh
hahaha - ayo ren, what we gon' call this - "tell 'em what your name is"?
yeah, somethin' like that (ooh, ooh)
haha, ah yeah (ooh, ooh)
compton's definitely in the house (ooh, ooh)
word (ooh, ooh) (ooh-ooh)
hahahaha
(ooh-ooh) (ooh, ooh)
(last one)
(ooh, ooh)
