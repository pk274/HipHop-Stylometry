camouflage in the lounge of the club
i peep the bar, honeys got they little buzz tryna get tough
one slipped the waiter a dub to approach me askin'
if i had a lady friend cause she's from out of town, pursuin' actin'
new to drama, her body gesture, gave her the name
groupie so i played her like a movie extra
hurt her pride like the nutty professor
she was cute, but it's more than looks that gets me seduced
tried to check her with respect, why? she tried to get fly
trippin', gettin' loud, spillin' drinks on my karl kani
hold up! i'm in the chillin', sippin' wine, i'm illin'
intellectual conversations, talkin' plans of buildin', what?
clean cut, how does that sound? a gentle man
plus a spiritual background, that's how i get down
just think of all these honeys that be thinkin' corrupt
before i get caught up in lust, i tell 'em all you best to just
