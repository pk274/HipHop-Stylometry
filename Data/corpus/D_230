it's still dre day nigga, ak nigga
though i've grown alot, can't keep it home alot
'cause when i frequent the spots that i'm known to rock
you hear the bass from the truck when i'm on the block
ladies, they pay homage, but haters say dre fell off
how nigga? my last album was the chronic
they want to know if he still got it
they say rap's changed, they want to know how i feel about it


since the last time you heard from me i lost some friends
well, hell, me & snoop, we dippin' again
kept my ear to the streets, signed eminem
he's triple platinum, doin' 50 a week
still, i stay close to the heat
& even when i was close to defeat, i rose to my feet
my life's like a soundtrack i wrote to the beat
treat rap like cali weed, i smoke 'til i sleep
wake up in the am compose a beat
i bring the fire 'til your soakin' in your seat
it's not a fluke, it's been tried, i'm the truth
since "turn out the lights" from the world class wreckin' cru
i'm still at it, after-mathematics
in the home of drive-by's & akmatics
swap meets, sticky green & bad traffic
i dip through then i get skin, d.r.e

(chorus - twice)

it ain't nothin' but more hot shit
another classic cd for y'all to vibe with
whether your coolin' on a corner wit your fly bitch
laid back in the shack, play this track
i'm representin' for the gangsta's all across the world
still...
