i won’t pretend
that i intend to stop living
i won’t pretend
i’m good at forgiving
but i can’t hate you
although i have tried
i, i
(later on tonight you might, feel a little sting)
(that’s pride, i'm fuckin' with you)
(fuck pride, you fight through that shit)


like every other hour when i think about you
so now and then i drink about you
trying to numb the pain with juice and gin
it’s like abuse, what’s the use of the bumps and bruises
if we moving towards a losing end
if i’m losing you then i refuse to win
went from friendship with benefits
you losing your innocence
i can help you reminisce, we in madrid
on some double-oh seven shit, we off the grid
parting moments of pleasure, we never thought we’d ever
suffer the consequences, the problem is, there’s a problem trying to kick this addiction
we probably can't resolve it without causing some friction
this is non-fiction, the definition of a true story
i’m like fuck pride baby that’s the kind of shit you do for me
suicide it's a suicide, i'm ready to die, you down to ride or what?
