super ugly (nigga!)
i don't give a fuck


me and the boy a.i. got more in common
than just balling and rhyming—get it? more in carmen
i came in your bentley backseat (damn)
skeeted in your jeep (woo)
left condoms on your baby-seat (woo)
here, nigga—the gloves is off, the love is done
it's whatever, whenever, however, nigga (one!)
and since you infatuated with saying that gay shit: (faggot)
bitch, you was kissing my dick when you was kissing that bitch! (oh)
nasty shit, you thought i was boning renette
you calling carm' a hundred times, i was boning her neck
you got a baby by the broad, you can't disown her yet
when does your lies end? when does the truth begin?
when does reality set in, or does it not matter?
gotta hurt: i'm your baby mama's favorite rapper (haha)
and ask your current girl, she know what's up
holla at a real nigga! jigga! (i don't give a fuck!)
