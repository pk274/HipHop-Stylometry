dre, talk


i'm dr. dre, gorgeous hunk of a man
doing tricks on the mix that no others can
the nurses say i'm cute, they say i'm fine
so you better beware because i'll blow your mind
i'll put you in my car, i'll take you to my home
then up and down your body, my fingers will roam
the girls say i'm nasty, they say that i'm mean
but when they come to my pad, they're guaranteed to scream
ahh
