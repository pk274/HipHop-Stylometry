they said thirty's the new twenty, funny
must mean forty's the new thirty, interesting
'cause ever since then, it's been, in a sense, an extension
for veteran rappers that are better than half of
the shit comin' out right now, it's all trash
the torch is gonna burn out before it gets passed
jay said it's his last, then 50 and em
then what? detox drops, what do we got then?
so now our whole camps is runnin' around
scrambling over what to do
gamblin' every time we put a record out
just lookin' for that hook (wait, dre, look!)
