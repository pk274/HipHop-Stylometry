truthfully speaking, it's lonely up here all by myself
so i had to come down and pass around some help
from n.w.a to whatever's next
make sure it says "andre young" in bold letters on big checks
your shit ain't sellin'? fuck it, get dr. dre on it
you got a budget? i'll get down, give me half of it
one session, one song, i'm gone
the first week, you hit the streets, a star is born
to add to my universe - let me show you
who can invade who, nigga, and who can do who the worst
warning from the surgeon general
watch out for fake hits and bullshit that sounds identical
pick it up, read the credits, who you thought it was?
twenty years in the game, with a constant buzz
pick a year, any year, see how hot i was
same shit today, still don't give a fuck!
