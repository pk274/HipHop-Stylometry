i don't know everything, but one thing, one thing i do know
one thing, one thing i do know (i know, i know, i know)
is one day, i'mma have everything—is one day, i'mma have every thing
it was all a dream, it was all a dream (i want it all!)

i just bought california
them other states ain't far behind it either
i remember selling instrumentals off a beeper
millionaire before the headphones or the speakers
i was getting money 'fore the internet
still got eminem checks i ain't opened yet
m.v.p. shit—this is where the trophies at
d-r-e, yeah, this is where the dope is at
the world ain't enough, i want it all
goddammit, i'm too old, i forgot i got it all
but andre young enough to still get involved
and andre still young enough to say fuck y'all
fuck you, fuck you, and you in the corner, too
if you wanna beef, make sure that that's somethin' you wanna do
there's some missin' people that felt that way too


i don't know everything, but one thing, one thing i do know
one thing, one thing i do know (i know, i know, i know)
is one day, i'mma have everything—is one day, i'mma have every thing
it was all a dream, it was all a dream (i want it all!)

i don't know everything, but one thing, one thing i do know
one thing, one thing i do know (i know, i know, i know)
is one day i'mma have everything—is one day, i'mma have every thing
it was all a dream, it was all a dream (i want it all!)
