up out the projects
i'm at the top of the toppest
you see the frontin' i did
tryin' to kill me with them lies and that perjury
icu tryin' to fuck me while i'm in surgery
in icu, deathbed, on some money shit
greedy bitch, take a pick, girl you know how money get
no matter how you check it, just a kid from compton
vaccine claim, fuck a johnson & johnson
you know we don’t tolerate that nonsense
by any means, get your hand up out my pocket (please)
this life is private, just like the pilot, it’s been decided, this the poseidon
