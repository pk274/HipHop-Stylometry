sitting in my living room, calm and collected
feeling that gotta-get-mine perspective
'cause what i just heard broke me in half
and half the niggas i know, plus the niggas on the row is bailing
laugh now, but cry much later
you see, when niggas get together, they get mad 'cause they can't fade us
like my niggas from south central, los angeles
they found that they couldn't handle us
bloods, crips on the same squad
with the ese's helpin', nigga, it's time to rob and mob
and break the white man off something lovely, biddy-bye-bye
i don't love dem so dem can't love me
yo, straight puttin' it down, gettin' my scoot on
it's jumping off in compton so i gots to get my loot on
and come up on me some furniture or somethin'
got a vcr in the back of my car
that i ganked from the slauson swap meet
and motherfuckers better not try to stop me
'cause they will see that i can't be stopped
'cause i'ma cock my glock and pop 'til they all drop
