it was once a time in the days of wayback
when niggas was gettin' jacked
in fact, it was when i used to pass through the
and kickin' ass through a muthafuckin' compton massacre
now, let me tell you a little somethin' about compton
when i was a kid and puttin' my bid in
yo, compton was like still water - just strictly calm
now it's like muthafuckin' vietnam
everybody killin', tryin' to make a killin'
niggas stealin', muthafuckas wheelin' and dealin'
with so many ways to come up
the average nigga didn't give a fuck
about another muthafucka in this game and
claimin' what he claimin', livin' like he livin', killin' after killin'
murder was a dirty job, to rob a dead man was the best plan
'cause a dead man never ran
but now your best friend is your worst friend
greed, kids to feed, make a me more some of what you holdin'
so, now your shit is stolen and you and your niggas start rollin'
yo, to get your shit back ain't the word up
muff? it's more murder, more murder, more murder
they wanna make you think that it's a crack thang or a black thang
or some niggas in a muthafuckin' gang
but guns and money, they go together like the ku klux klan
a nigga brung up and strung up
why do i call myself a nigga you ask me?
rememberin' the days that's past me
yo, never givin' niggas a chance to rest
the ghetto is like a fuckin' survival test
and number one way for you to pass
yo, get treated like a king and they'll crown your ass
they never in the wrong though so i made a song so
muthafuckas would know
if your livin' situations make you wanna get a gat (a gat)
that's 'cause you livin' in the dayz of wayback...
