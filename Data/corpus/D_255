it's still compton nigga, ain't shit changed
nothin', but the numbers on the back of the range
my arms got buffer, tracks got buffer
cars got faster, stacks got buffer
nigga, do the math, about a hundred million sold
in the best shape ever, i don't even feel old
i can run laps round these young ass niggas
shit i'm like 
need a hit, nigga, come and see the doctor
20 years in the game, 
bitch ass niggas and bitch ass bitches
focus on my cash, steady plottin' all my riches
why you wanna know how much money i got
don't you niggas know you can't fuck with the doc?
i can give you 20 mil and be just fine
enough to live wealthy at least 10 life times
still andre, no more alize
thinkin' 'bout comin' out with my own champagne
gang of niggas try to imitate my style like
"dre won't mind, he ain't dropped in a while"
but, they don't ever seem to do it quite like this
niggas know we started this gangsta shit
i done came a long way from nwa
still a nigga with a attitude, fuck the police
and fuck that little faggot george bush, too
aftermath, nigga, i'm the president, too


need a hit, nigga, come and see the doctor
20 years in the game,
