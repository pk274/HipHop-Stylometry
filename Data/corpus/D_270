things just ain't the same for gangstas
times is changin', young niggas is agin'
becoming og's in the game and changin'
to make way for these new names and faces
but the strangest things can happen from rappin'
when niggas get wrapped up in image and actin'
niggas get capped up and wrapped in plastic
zipped up in bags—when it happens, that's it
i've seen 'em come, i've watched 'em go
watched 'em rise, witnessed it, and watched 'em blow
watched 'em all blossom and watched 'em grow
watched the lawsuits when they lost the dough
best friends and money: i lost 'em both
went and visited niggas in the hospital
it's all the same shit all across the globe
i just sit back and watch the show (the watcher)


i moved out of the hood for good—you blame me?
niggas aim, mainly, at niggas they can't be
but niggas can't hit niggas they can't see
i'm out of sight now, i'm out of they dang reach
how would you feel if niggas wanted you killed?
you'd probably move to a new house on a new hill
and choose a new spot, if niggas wanted you shot
i ain't a thug—how much 2pac in you you got?
i ain't no bitch, neither
it's either my life or your life and i ain't leavin', i like breathin'
'cause nigga, we can go round for round
clip for clip—shit, four-pound for pound
nigga, if you really want to take it there, we can
just remember that you fuckin' with a family man
i got a lot more to lose than you
remember that when you wanna come and fill these shoes (the watcher)


things just ain't the same for gangstas
cops is anxious to put niggas in handcuffs
they wanna hang us, see us dead, or enslave us
keep us trapped in the same place we was raised in
then, they wonder why we act so outrageous
run around stressed out and pull out gauges
'cause every time you let the animal out cages
it's dangerous to people who look like strangers
but now, we got a new era of gangstas
hustlers and youngsters livin' amongst us
lookin' at us now, callin' us busters
can't help but reminisce back when it was us
nigga, we started this gangsta shit!
and this the motherfuckin' thanks i get?
it's funny how time flies
i'm just having fun, just watchin' it fly by (the watcher)
