use this gospel for this mission impossible, clear?
gotta let god’s love rain down if you here
when is that real love when the family fightin’ back the tears?
and i mean even with the cars, money, boats, and the lears?
rain down, rain down, rain down, rain down
'til the devil gained his reign down
take the pain out and i'm-
back where you started and found out that everything is gone
i was tryna get this laid off
bernie mad 'cause the way we made off (got it)
simplify, god, please exemplify (hah)
these corporate pimps will try to drain you 'til you done and die
all these ungrateful vibes, bringin' out my other side
(don't that sound just like us?)
look into my eyes (woo!), you don’t see the love inside? (hah)
use the gospel, use the word, use the scripture (hah)
for every jezebel (my energy) postin’ all the pictures  (hah)
you gon' put the internet before your family? (hah)
you know what? you deserve to drive a camry (hah)
because, it's because of you they don't know the hard times
we gotta find, leavin' this ain't negative, some of my loves
i'ma use my love, i'ma use it for the better
i done wrote you a ‘scarded letter
