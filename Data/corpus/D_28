i got mo' class than most of 'em, ran with the best of 'em
forgave the less of 'em and blazed at the rest of 'em
i'm not rich i only got a hundred dollars
and each one of my dollars immediately yo' dollars
analytically, i survive the game politically
god's with me, that's why heavily (?heavenly?), i sign satirically
my breath smells endo, i spit the thunder
let me break this shit down, so you don't have to wonder


let me bring this shit down for you like rapunzel

rocking s-classes, my whole committee so blunted
niggas evacuated the steez
all in all love, until dre had enough
and toting on anybody who ain't close enough to touch
cold like the whisper, quick with the inter
sold rappers seven solo stars than a ninja
pass to (?gary bellum?) i'm about to tell 'em
just so i can put on a new (?album and laugh at em?)
i'm hittin' switches, makin' bitches eat bitches
see me grab my dick every time i pose for pictures
i own acres, floor seats watchin' the lakers
i'm cool with eses who got ak's in cases
