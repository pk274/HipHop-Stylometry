i got mo' class than most of 'em, ran with the best of 'em
forgave the less of 'em and blazed at the rest of 'em
what can i say? cali-for-ni-a
where niggas die every day over some shit they say
disconnected from the streets forever
as long as i got a beretta, nigga, i'm down for whateva
i roll with my shit off safety, for niggas that been hatin' me lately
and the bitches that wanna break me
if cali blew up, i'd be in the aftermath
bumpin' gangsta rap shit, down to blast for cash
'cause from eazy-e, to d.o.c., to d.p.g
started from that s.o.b., d.r.e
like dub-c, i'm rich rollin', pistol holdin'
pockets swole nigga, that's how i'm rollin'
put the flame to the killer, nigga
worldwide homicide mob figure in the building, for real
i'm hittin' switches, makin' bitches eat bitches
see me grab my dick every time i pose for pictures
i own acres, floor seats watchin' the lakers
i'm cool with eses who got ak's in cases
