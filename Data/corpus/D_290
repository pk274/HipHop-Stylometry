streets is talkin, sayin dre done changed
and he ain't been to the hood, well how the fuck i find game?
i studied this rap shit, still a "hundred miles and runnin'"
still makin aftermath classics
you might catch me out in traffic
oh-five aston, bitches askin "where i'm from"
y'all forgot who helped 50 cent pop
i ain't spent my own money since eminem dropped
in eighty-fo' i had the streets locked
i am to gangsta rap what biz markie is to beatbox
niggas think cause i stopped on that "detox"
i traded in my all stars for some freeboks
speakers still bumpin, the beats still comin
compton's version of phil drummond
same dre, "different strokes," same six-fo', different spokes
same "chronic" just a different smoke
