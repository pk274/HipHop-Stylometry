ay, ay, ay where the fuck did t just go?


lookin' at my rolex, it's about that time
to crack open the hennessey and roll up a dime
line after line, i'm blowin' your mind
disrespect and get the nine to your spine
a gang of niggas try but they never come close to
the big time player livin' like i'm supposed to
so when you see me rollin' in the testarossa
you can best believe i got the strap in my holster
mobbing son, poppin', robbin', son, like sugar roy
put your gun away or get done away like faye
got beats and stock cops, you never see the props stop
steady dippin', strippin' mcs like a chop shop
now who wanna get with the black frank nitti?
i ran through your city and left with my boots shitty
nobody gets looser than this producer
coordinate tracks that's live, three or four cars to ride
oh, comin' out of la, regulatin' the west coast
east coast and between coasts, then i'm ghost
i know you're bobbin' your head cause i can see ya
but you can't see me, the d-r-e and the king t
