what's my name, my name is mr. game
west coast big change mr. fame
bad bitch scooped her up same ol' same
fuckin' in the drivers seat while i'm switching lanes
gettin' brain, long beach, compton thang
shit ain't changed that's how we do the damn thang
draws down nuts platinum, let 'em hang
wife missin' 5 am, who's to blame
i'm the reason used magnum is in your range
and while she bounced out wit me before you came
fuckin lame you be handcuff sluts i banged
i ain't trippin', take 'em back, shit, my nuts is drained
on everything this dick is shootin' novacane
have a bitch waitin' bus stop, in the rain
simple and plain 'cause we's be off the chain
my nigga nate dogg, kick game, please explain
