what the fuck?
this shit bangin'!
hey, my nigga mel-man told me
if you throw a rock at a pack of bitch ass niggas
the only one who’s gon’ scream out is the one who got hit
so you know what? fuck all you niggas
you, you and you
you know


well it’s the d-r, d-r-e and hitt mizzy
keep it hot as hell up in la city
fuck a gang, only set i fear
rollin' fifties, cause they can get me
for this heat i’m holdin' with me
my golden four fever's a hole in your head leave a
put that ass to sleep, ain't talking 'bout the bed either
the home of the red and blue, you need to come clean like lever -
2000, chronic album, still smokin'
for real locin'
much ain't gotta be said to get your shit broken
heart or jaw, i'm hard i'm raw
nothin' to prove to y'all
just dippin' down compton boulevard
if you didn't help me go platinum or suck my dick, you're useless
8 ball to the gall for y'all who thought that gatorade was baller juices
saw the aftermath recruits, rivals labels wanna call truces
try to stall us, send their harlots to seduce us
we composed of brawlers, ballers, emcees, producers
no losers allowed, don't be confusin' the style
chronic 2000, here and now
blaaow!
