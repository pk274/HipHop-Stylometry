introducing the star of our show
his name is (marshall!)
you wouldn't wanna be anywhere else in the world right now
so without further ado, i bring to you (marshall!)


let's get down to business

on these clowns; can i get a witness? (hell yeah!)

it's just like old times, the dynamic duo
two old friends, why panic? you already know
who's fully capable, the two caped heroes
dial straight down the center, eight-zero-zero
you can even call collect, the most feared duet
since me and elton played career russian roulette
and never even see me blink or get to bustin' a sweat
people steppin' over people just to rush to the set
just to get to see an mc who breathes so freely
ease over these beats and be so breezy
jesus, how can shit be so easy?
how can one chandra be so levy?
turn on these beats, mcs don't see me
believe me, bet and mtv
are gonna grieve when we leave, dog, fo' sheezy
can't leave rap alone, the game needs me
'til we grow beards, get weird and disappear
into the mountains, nothin' but clowns down here
but we ain't fuckin' around 'round here
yo, dre (what up?) can i get a "hell..."? (hell yeah!)
