now let me welcome everybody to the wild wild west
a state that's untouchable like eliot ness
the track hits your eardrum like a slug to your chest
pack a vest for your jimmy in the city of sex
we in that sunshine state where the bomb-ass hemp be
the state where you never find a dance floor empty
and pimps be on a mission for them greens
lean mean money-making-machines servin' fiends
i been in the game for 10 years makin' rap tunes
ever since honeys was wearin' sassoon
now it's '95 and they clock me and watch me
diamonds shinin', lookin' like i robbed liberace
it's all good, from diego to the bay
your city is the bomb if your city makin' pay
throw up a finger if you feel the same way
dre puttin' it down for californ-i-a


i’m back under ya cap with zapp
droppin’ them bomb-ass raps that hit ya like pimp-slaps
so everybody on the dance-floor, the wallflowers got to go, grab yourself a skirt and flow
‘cause it’s a grownup party and i’m glad that ya made it
‘california love,’ ladies gettin’ faded, we got freaks, freaks and more freaks
they got ass for weeks and tweak skirts hugging they buttchecks
i'm on a mission to keep they heads ringin'
and keep your body shakin', plus bring home the bacon
i puff herb like a jamacian, hennessy on top
here to represent and put the west on the map
the land of the locs and the 100 smokes
put bulletproof vests under my coat 'cause the lead's no joke
can you feel?
cali is the place where i chill in '95 until


pasadena, where you at?
yeah, inglewood
inglewood always up to no good
sacramento, sacramento where you at?
frisco, frisco
that's right
west coast, west coast
california love, california love
