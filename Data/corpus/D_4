yeah, she got that shit that make you kill a nigga
crack that last bottle, i'll kill it with you
pour my feelings out and spill it with you
that's a no-no, but what he don't know
never hurt him, so just desert him
i find it hard to believe that he ain't pullin' your weave
no, i'm kiddin', i'm knowin' my dick is different
he kept his distance, i kept comin' over and stayed persistent
you bitin' your lips, toes twitching and she crinching
steamin' up the bathroom 'til we left it a sauna
i beat it up and now you usin' my tee as pajamas
your friends tried to warn you about me, even your mama
but you said you'd deal with the consequence, even if it was karma
but how can i complain when you give me insane brain?
like you graduated with honors, you probably hate that i'm honest
but, fuck it, i'm going all out
you should too, good things don't last forever, i thought you knew
