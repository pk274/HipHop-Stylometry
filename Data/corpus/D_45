same old shit, gibberish
why the fuck you wanna choke me?
i don't give no kisses, i have no wife
buncha toddlers wanna sleep in my crib
well, niggas, sorry, you're in bad luck, you're not welcome
watermelon dripping from my head, it's a mess
be the one who wants to fuck me
i already fucked a lot of people
call the police, my brand new boots are on fire
whoo, i wish i had a twin dre
i'm not happy by myself, uh
why the thunder tryna scare me, ayy
whoa, bitches, outta my face
we need the cops for these real nigga lawbreakers

they gotta stop crying, you know (dre) (50 cent) with crying and screaming babies
sold out, bitch
