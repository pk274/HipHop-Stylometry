now please don't give me a reason, reason
'cause i know you wanna keep breathing this evening
i've been killing the game for seasons, believe him
that i'm the motherfuckin' one to breed them and lead 'em
in a league of my own
you ain't even made it up to my throne
you ain't even authorized for this song
might be best for you to get goin'
best be careful about your tone
that shit can hit me wrong and it's on
i have tried my best to be calm
please don't make me grab that phone (uh-oh)
now who you know who came this fucking far
from the fucking bottom?
thirty years in this bitch and i'm still here
decade after decade
and evidently i must be doing somethin' right
word to my nigga eazy

i went from hanging out down at the swap meet
to driving some of the hottest cars l.a. has ever seen
people been tellin' me i've grown into some kind of monster
but they don't know me though, i've been this way since seventeen
tryna get finances poppin', man, i thought that was the object
'til some of my niggas lost they life and then there goes the team
my only dream was holding it down, like, fuck who tryna stop us
you could get the middle finger or the reddest beam
it's your choice, i took this industry by storm, young and black
killing them softly
don't ever call me fortunate, you don't know what it cost me
so anybody complaining about they circumstances lost me, homie
we ain't even talkin', fuck that energy, fuck up off me, ugh!
