where you from, nigga?
(help me!)


i heard you talking about respect, i gave you niggas the utmost
all you niggas the utmost
would you look over picasso's shoulder
and tell him 'bout his brush strokes?
them opinions, i don't trust those
i apologize, the city made a nigga so cutthroat
every hood love me, but it started on one coast
could've stopped in '86 but i knew that you would want more
i'm on the throne in a place some niggas won't go


(don't get it fucked up!) been away from home
but i ain't been gone that long
(all they wanna know is: where you from? where you from?
where you from, nigga, huh? compton!)


psst! this is about where i'm from
i think it's time to take these niggas to the deep water
yeah, down in the pacific (the pacific), representin'
where them sharks at, nigga, down in the deep water


listen, listen, listen, all you niggas swimming in the info
go fuck around and drown in the specifics
always going overboard, used to be my kinfolk
now you sleeping with the motherfuckin' fishes
(swimming with the mothefuckin' fishes, what the business?)
these niggas won't let up until they all wet up
(don't get it fucked up!) naw, nigga!
now everybody wanna visit tryna re-up that prescription
(that prescription, yep, yeah, re-up)
that's my nigga, watercolors couldn't even paint the picture
if they don't get the picture, fuck them
yeah, drugs by the dozen
you might just wanna go and check the children
(you might just wanna check your fuckin' children)
i'm the one that got they ear
ah, for many years, i been making parents live in fear
i just wanna make it clear: my influence run deep like the ocean


(don't get it fucked up!) been away from home
but i ain't been gone that long
(all they wanna know is: where you from? where you from?
where you from, nigga, huh? compton!)


(don't get it fucked up!) been away from home
been away from home all night long
(all they wanna know is: where you from?
where you from, nigga, huh? compton)
