listen, doc dre, you know i don't show up often
uh, but when i do, i put shit in motion
motion picture shit, nigga, picture me rollin'
a composer with composure, bitch, i'm compton's beethoven
silhouettes of naked bodies layin' in the sand
now that's california love, you know who the fuck i am
still hood, still good, chucks on my butlers
soundtrack in every neighborhood and causin' all this ruckus
mm, compton bully in this motherfucker (heh)
same nigga, same hoodie in this motherfucker
back in business, oh yeah, this is mass production
so tired of niggas talkin' when they just ballin' on the budget
still feel like a strugglin' artist and better believe i still love it
look at my life, shit, i did something right, easy does it (heh)
i'm just in here jugglin' time
but, for the moment, i'm on it, nigga, tryna get mine
you know the motherfuckin' mountains i climb
