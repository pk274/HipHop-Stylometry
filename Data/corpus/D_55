my life is like a highlight reel
some might consider this my twilight but depending how i might feel
i might continue on with my career for 5 light years
critics can fly kites here?
welcome to my nightmare
pressures on, blood pressure racing
i calculate my next step, pacin’
don’t know if i’ll meet expectations
all i know is the world better get set
dre’s in effect
been in it since you had cassette decks taping
i’m sick


it’s on, blood pressure racing
i calculate my next step which is to accept my expectations
they're soaring too high to meet, my reputations in jep’
yep, face it, the fans they’ve been upset yet patient, i love ‘em for that
