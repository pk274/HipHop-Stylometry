just tryna get my drama together (okay)
hold up (hol' up, hol' up, hol' up)
hold up (hol' up, hol' up, hol' up)
hold up, ugh


she tryna kick me down 'till i'm under the weather
yeah, i'm sick of this
ugh, finally sick of your shit
broken promises no benefits
that's what you get, real feelings slip
yeah, you know that was no accident
oh, fuck me huh? that's what you really meant?
now if we talkin' bout my life in this motherfucker
better know i'm ruling it
better hope i don't snap, and find a use for these hooligans
i'm here tryna not to take it to the street
but you keep diggin' in my pocket every week
didn't write one lyric, or make one beat
but i ain't trippin', the universe got a hold on me
so you know what it's gonna be, another victory (yah)
funny how things transpire
never thought i'd see that vampire energy
oh yeah, i see your blood suckin' tendencies
goodbye, shit, a natural born remedy
surgery, this that penicillin gettin' rid of the villain
and all these fucked up feelings (yeah)
so much for sunshine when she gone, see
and nothin' to lean on me (yah)
no more, nightmares in my daydreams
i was surrounded by jesters and a fake queen
but i still remain king
