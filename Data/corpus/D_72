when i said i hold my own, i wasn't frontin'
never claimed to be the baddest, for skills, i got a little somethin'
comin' through, new clique and tracks
known for blazin' on the chronic, that's what put me on the map
nothin' could give me more pleasure to start this
i worked the hardest
ducked the farthest, makin' me illest producin' artist
done crimes, ran from one-time
could catch me with my crew bustin' rhymes in the sunshine state
no case, to build i chill with millionaires
out to make a killin', for real, my resolution this year
few places i walked, most imagine
new faces i met at beauty pageants
past cuties now wanna do me
yo, i never forgot where i'm from
i check for family and every nigga who was down from day one
if you ain't speakin' money language, i can't hang
you know your conversation is weak, so it's senseless to speak
