don cortés, white rags, cherry bentley
cop shines from italy, speak money language fluently
never fuck wit' the nastiest, flashiest
bought a house big as scarface to show my happiness
rackin' the 6-0's, for those that want to get personal to home
cock the heavy metal, rollin' wit’ my stones
prominent wit’ flashy garments, spend a mill'
small bills bring a smile to a ice grill
popular, loved throughout the industry
if they sue, light a phillie 'cause the judges gotta free willy
salute wit’ chilled remy
gently escort four ladies a arm, the four seasons at the club
bentleys, condo suites — i'm fancy
20 floors up, overlookin' ladies, boomerang they panties
bump the firm family's latest, takin' trips to las dregas
that's how we do at aftermath incorporated


while i lounge in a jacuzz', sky clear blue
got the whole crew — nas, az, nature, foxy there too
how we do? hit trees, cristal bottles
breeze tropical, spread love 'til we wobble
it's time to give, let the kids live comfortable
anybody pumpin' beef between east and west? fuck you!
make moves political, get this revenue
set examples, respect every individual
