yeah, nigga, we're still fuckin' wit' you
still waters run deep
still snoop dogg and d.r.e.
'99, nigga, guess who's back
still, still doin' that shit, huh, dre?
oh for sho'
yeah
check me out

it's still dre day nigga, ak nigga
though i've grown a lot, can't keep it home a lot
'cause when i frequent the spots that i'm known to rock
you hear the bass from the truck when i'm on the block
ladies they pay homage, but haters say dre fell off
how? nigga, my last album was the chronic (nigga)
they wanna know if he still got it
they say rap's changed, they wanna know how i feel about it
(if you ain't up on thangs)
dr. dre is the name, i'm ahead of my game
still puffin' my leaves, still fuck with the beats
still not lovin' police (huh-uh)
still rock my khakis with a cuff and a crease (for sho')
still got love for the streets, reppin' 213 (for life)
still the beats bang, still doin' my thang
since i left ain't too much changed, still


i'm representin' for them gangstas all across the world
(still) hittin' them corners in them low-lows, girl
still takin' my time to perfect the beat
and i still got love for the streets, it's the d.r.e.
i'm representin' for them gangstas all across the world

since the last time you heard from me i lost some friends
well, hell, me and snoop, we dippin' again
kept my ear to the streets, signed eminem
he's triple platinum, doin' fifty a week
still, i stay close to the heat
and even when i was close to defeat, i rose to my feet
my life's like a soundtrack i wrote to the beat
treat rap like cali weed: i smoke 'til i'm 'sleep
wake up in the a.m., compose a beat
i bring the fire 'til you're soakin' in your seat
it's not a fluke, it's been tried, i'm the truth
since "turn out the lights" from the world class wreckin cru
i'm still at it, after mathematics
in the home of drive-bys and ak-matics
swap meets, sticky green, and bad traffic
i dip through, then i give you (still) d.r.e.

it ain't nothin' but more hot shit
another classic cd for y'all to vibe with
whether you're coolin' on the corner wit' your fly bitch (biatch)
laidback in the shack, play this track
i'm representin' for the gangstas all across the world
still (hittin' them corners in them low-lows, girl)
i'll break your neck, damn near put your face in your lap
niggas try to be the king, but the ace is back
(so if you ain't up on thangs)
dr. dre be the name (what?), still runnin' the game
still got it wrapped like a mummy
still ain't trippin', love to see young blacks get money
spend time out the hood, take they moms out the hood
hit my boys off with jobs, no more livin' hard (nah, nah)
barbeques every day, drivin' fancy cars (hey, hey)
still gon' get mine regardless (still)
