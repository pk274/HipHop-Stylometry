i got a fist full of dollars
(just for talking that shit)
rich rap scholars
(cause we talking that shit)
while we plan to live forever
(always talking that shit)
you need to get your shit together
(and stop talking that shit)
it's the top of the division
(when we talking that shit)
knock 'em out position
(if you talking that shit)
ayo anything can happen
(just for talking that shit)
now watch us go platinum
(and keep talking that shit)
