it's the high life, in them bright lights
with all stars on a hot night

when she get drunk, she gon' wanna fuck
daddy girl, got a runway life
she got a june 5 flight, to drink all night
with some stars at the club, gettin' high as a kite
but when we pay the cost, get as high as you like

she wanna dance like a pussycat
panties and her bra like she posing for baby phat
