i'm seeing millions, niggas don't understand
know what? i'm makin' moves, puttin' cash behind plans
to blow up, will he style like this
everyday i parlay, sip henny and tanqueray
stay in the mix like aliz√©
v.i.p., my shit parked valet
on the prowl again to get honeys familiar with the smile again
some try to assault dre, its still cavi
i'm eatin' steak while they struggle to break the slave mentality
i givin' livin' definition long as my hearts tickin'
i fought and made the world listen
whatever flop dr. dre invented?
turn on the box and let my son watch these studio clowns on 60 inches
i push a rover, shit platinum before the sessions over
rap master with the houston heat holder
these playas best to get they shit in check
'cause when i get my hustle on ain't no playin' with a full deck


smokin' weed i never trail, i lead
spendin' dough, tripped the cost of a ride like it was pocket money, gs
but these are the things real playas do
talkin' shit is real things that the hatas do
i'm namin' you
shit's thick, its time to run for shelter
i kept the word, things could happen to marks like it was helter skelter
