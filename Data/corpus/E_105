yeah yeah bitch
comin' to a block near you is dirty dozen
nasty like a stank slut bitch with 30 husbands
when i was five i was already fuckin'
and playin' x-rated cassettes
with teddy ruxpin
i used to walk up and down the block cussin'
locked in youth homes at 6 for glock bustin'
i grew up with knot ballers who got dollars
shot callers with guns and rottweilers


bust a nut and dump that bitch in lake st. clair
your mistakes ain't rare
your rap style annoys
you rhyme like a bitch, plus i can't stand your voice
bitch you suck, you whack as fuck
eat a dick, you need a brick upside your dome
we be the clique runnin' you down in carloads
leavin' you smashed on tar roads
flat line like bar codes
