you are now listening to the sounds of shady
and alchemist
alchemist
alchemist


got an axe in the duffel bag
couple of fags stuffed in the backseat
muzzled and gagged, wrapped in bubble wrap
two lesbians, a couple hustler mags
now grab the pez dispenser
fill it up to the max with muscle relaxers
the governor of alaska, she lusts when i ask her
to shove my pulaski sausage up in her ass, huh
while we hover over nebraska
shootin' at the fuckin' buffalo pasture
in the helicopter, man, i can't fuck her no faster
she's screamin' "grab my titties, shady, suck on those bastards"
but i ain't no sucker, i won't snuggle up with her after
i'm a gigolo, bitch, i look like the juggalo rapper?
every day, man, i just seem to get a little bit doper
shit, back down? man, i'd rather lick on a scrotum
and eat the fuckin' octomom's pussy lips with some okra
while i watch whoopi goldberg scissor with oprah
while rosie pussy-farts and takes a piss on the sofa
get a boner and play dick swords with the jonas brothers
your motherfuckin' mother's aroma's like no other
i keep thinkin' of her smothered in somas


it's chemical warfare, drop bombs like saddam
i'm bringing the drama, like barack obama
playing rock 'em sock 'em robots with the octomama
i'm vato loco, homie i'll cock those llamas
for chemical warfare


did i just say octomom twice in the same rap?
fucking wack
chemical warfare
chemical warfare
