nowadays everybody just wanna poke their nose in our business

man, everywhere i go all i’m hearing is more talk
"what’s up with jada and fat joe?
doing a song with ol’ boy on a song “new york”
man, i thought you just did a song with them both?”
man, the streets wanna know how you gonna go and diss michael
you should get your ghetto pass revoked
i never had no ghetto pass, you asshole
you really wanna know, when i did live in the ghetto
i kept a trespassing charge up at the railroad tracks
so i suggest you get your facts straight before you go
this assuming to know
i ain't grow up in no trailer park just cause i was poor

and if you feel like you want it then you can get it too
and when your through pass it to the person next to you
