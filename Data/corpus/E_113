like a verbal seduction when
seduction when i tell 'em girls on the floor
i don't know, man (geh-geh-geh)
just feels like we're a lot different (right now)
(girls on the floor) it kinda feels like (like a verbal seduction when)
i'm on a whole different page right now than you (girls on the floor)
it feels strange, but umm (girls on the floor)
i guess it's kinda like, it's kinda like...


i feel like i'm morphin' into somethin' that's so incredible
that i'm dwarfin' all competitors
better get your girlfriend in check
it's psychological warfare, endorphins i effect
your self-esteem shatters as dialect comes blastin' out your deck
she loves me, such passion, you'd expect
this sort of reaction from her, yet you strong-arm
you're fuckin' corny, you try to turn your charm on
'cause you just think you're bishop the don juan
but if you think that you're fuckin' with me, homie, you're on one
i'm cockin' my head back like ed lover, "c'mon, son!"
she's on my johnson, she brings my name up constant
your boys are like, "she's fuckin' with dude, she wants some"
homeboy, you better get a clue
she's on my dick 'cause i spit better than you
what you expect her to do?
how you expect her to act in the sack when she's closin' her eyes
fantasizin' of diggin' her nails in my back to this track?


seduction, seduce
ain't nobody who's as good at what i do
(it's like a verbal seduction when)
'cause one minute she loves you, the next she don't
she's been stolen from you
(it's like a verbal seduction when)
seduction, seduce
ain't nobody who's as good at what i do
'cause one minute she loves you, the next she don't
she's been stolen from you
(it's like a verbal seduction when)


she's sittin' there gettin' liquored up at the bar
she says it's quicker to count the things that ain't wrong with you
than to count the things that are
there's a seven-disc cd changer in her car
and i'm in every single slot, and you're not — aww!
i'm the logo on that dallas cowboy helmet: a star
and i'm not about to sit back
and just keep rhymin' one syllable — naw!
switch it up and watch them haters not give it up
'cause they're just not good enough, but i'm not givin' up
'til i get my respect and i won't stop 'til i get enough
'cause i'm not livin' up to my own expectations (aww!)
that hater alarm is soundin' off
and obama took the bomb from my name (aww!)
so quit cryin' that i took your dame, homie, she's my dame (aww!)
you sadly mistaken if you thinkin' that i'm not on my game, boy
and things just ain't been the same since the day that i came forth
you wear your heart on your sleeve, i sport that white tank, boy
but you got a hard-on for me, what you hollerin' my name for?
it's your bitch on my dick, ain't my dang fault, man, i can't call it


seduction, seduce
ain't nobody who's as good at what i do
(it's like a verbal seduction when)
'cause one minute she loves you, the next she don't
she's been stolen from you
(it's like a verbal seduction when)

it's like we're playin' lyrical tug of war with your ear
you hear it, girl? come here
put your ear up to the speaker, dear
while i freak this world premiere
seducin' her, loosen up
with a little freestyle that'll— wait, am i losin' ya?
am i makin' you look bad? well, i got news for ya
homie, you losin' her
oh wait, she don't like when i spit it fast
am i tryin' to show how? let me slow it down some
it's still gonna be a blow-out
you're gonna wanna throw out your whole album
rummage through the shit and try to salvage somethin' to see
if you can save any of it, punk, but none of it's fuckin' with me
prick, you really feelin' that bullshit?
you think you killin' them syllables? quit
playin', these beats ain't nothin' to fool with
they call me fire marshall: i shut the shit down
your entire arsenal is not enough to fuck with one round
i am also the opposite of what you are like
you're a microcosm of what the fuck i am on the mic
i am awesome and you are just awe-struck
she's love-stricken, she's got her jaw stuck
from suckin' my dick... aw, fuck


seduction, seduce
