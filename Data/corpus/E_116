yeah, haha
you feel that, baby?
yeah, i feel it too, damn
(i'm so bad, i'm so good that i'm so bad)
you know, i'm so glad we could spend this time together
(i guarantee i'll be the greatest thing you ever had)
you see, i'm not as crazy as you thought i was, am i?
('cause you ain't never met nobody like me
and you ain't gonna wanna fuck nobody else again)


i'm the american dream
i'm the definition of white trash ballin', i'm right back on 'em
with a— err-chick-err, chicka-chick— i can't call it
same shit, different toilet, oh, you got a nice ass, darling
can't wait to get you into my benz, take you for a spin
what you mean we ain't fuckin'? you take me for a friend?
let me tell you the whole story of shady's origin
you'll be sorry if you slam my mercedes door again
now, it all started with my father
i must've got my pimpin' genes from him the way he left my momma
i'm a rolling stone, just like him, word to johnny drama
keep my entourage with me, baby, i'll make a promise
there ain't nobody as bomb as me, i'm as calm as
the breeze, i'm the bee's knees, his legs, and his arms, i'm a
superstar, girl, i'm ready for you, mama
why you think the only thing i got on is my pajamas?


i'm so bad, i'm so good that i'm so bad
i guarantee i'll be the greatest thing you ever had
'cause you ain't never met nobody like me
and you ain't gonna wanna fuck nobody else again
i'm so bad, i'm so good that i'm so bad
i guarantee i'll be the greatest thing you ever had
'cause you ain't never met nobody like me
and you ain't gonna wanna fuck nobody else again


i'm equivalent to a shot of cuervo, first, i'll kiss your navel
work my way down, baby, you can lay down on the table
but you may wanna find somethin' more stable
i told you i ain't foolin' from the gate, this ain't the first day of april
but thank you for stayin', april, i'ma make you
learn to appreciate me, differentiate me
from these phony, little fishy and sissy fake gs
skip over the "huggy bear," and all the "kissy face," please
initiate phase three, missy, now service me
take another shot of jäger, shake it so nervously
take your time, baby, ooh, you're the bomb, baby
ooh, you're doing that even better than your mom, lady
i told you why i'm shady, you didn't listen now, did ya?
relax, woman, you know that i'm only kiddin' wit' ya
got a twisted sense of humor, it's warped, but i didn't hit ya
i think you're finally startin' to get the picture, i'm just–


i'm so bad, i'm so good that i'm so bad
i guarantee i'll be the greatest thing you ever had
'cause you ain't never met nobody like me
and you ain't gonna wanna fuck nobody else again
i'm so bad, i'm so good that i'm so bad
i guarantee i'll be the greatest thing you ever had
'cause you ain't never met nobody like me
and you ain't gonna wanna fuck nobody else again

'cause i'm on to the next girl
and the next girl, i kinda like, oh, oh, oh


i got you caught up in the rapture, make you recapture
the feelings you had for your last boyfriend before he slapped ya
you never wanted someone so bad, you're
sweatin', but if i'm what you wanted
why'd you panic when i grabbed ya?
girl, don't be so frantic, i'm just a hopeless romantic
don't try to fight the feeling of somethin' that's so organic
you can't ignore it, so don't, just stand before it
just drop them panties to the floor, let's get to camcordin'
damn, shawty, i told you this was bound to happen
soon as you wrote your number on the napkin
i was bound to work a number on your back
and throw your spine out of alignment
my love has got you so blind that
you couldn't pick amy winehouse out of a line-up
so stop at the store, pick a pint up
let's get the pineapple schnapps going, no one will knock
'cause i'ma hang a sign up saying "don't disturb"
shawty, i'm so superb
i say the right things, don't i spit the dopest words?


i'm so bad, i'm so good that i'm so bad
i guarantee i'll be the greatest thing you ever had
'cause you ain't never met nobody like me
and you ain't gonna wanna fuck nobody else again
i'm so bad, i'm so good that i'm so bad
i guarantee i'll be the greatest thing you ever had
'cause you ain't never met nobody like me
and you ain't gonna wanna fuck nobody else again
