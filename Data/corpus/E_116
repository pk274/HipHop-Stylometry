oh! ladies and gentlemen
the moment you've all been waiting for
in this corner, weighing 175 pounds
with a record of 17 rapes, 400 assaults, and 4 murders
the undisputed, most diabolical villain in the world
slim shady! (let's go!)


so crack a bottle, let your body waddle
don't act like a snobby model, you just hit the lotto
oh-oh, oh-oh, bitches hoppin' in my tahoe
got one ridin' shotgun and no, not one of 'em got clothes
now, where's the rubbers? who's got the rubbers?
i noticed there's so many of 'em
and there's really not that many of us
and ladies love us, my posse's kickin' up dust
it's on 'til the break of dawn and we're starting this party from dusk


okay, let's go!


back with andre the giant, mr. elephant tusk
fix your musk, you'll be just another one bit the dust
just one of my mother's sons who got thrown under the bus
kiss my butt, lick fromunda cheese from under my nuts
it disgusts me to see the game the way that it looks
it's a must, i redeem my name and haters get mushed
bitches lust, man, they love me when i lay in the cut
fisticuffs, the lady give her eighty-some paper cuts
now picture us; it's ridiculous, you curse at the thought
'cause when i spit the verse the shit gets worse than worcestershire sauce
if i could fit the words, it's picture perfect, works every time
every verse, every line, as simple as nursery rhymes
it's elementary, the elephants have entered the room
i venture to say we're the center of attention, it's true
not to mention back with a vengeance, so hence the signal
of the bat symbol, the platinum trio's back on you hoes


so crack a bottle, let your body waddle
