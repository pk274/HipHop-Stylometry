"other man!"

i stand in slapped by the wind as i begin
do you know who i am? and many reply with a grin
yes, i'm tired of being obtruded
why should i be secluded? i've got a brand new horn to be tooted
to sum it up in a nutshell, "eminem will you kick it for me?"
so i find myself in a certain obligatory
a place that i dwell in, fell into some wonderful productions
to make up for lost time, and then it brings obstruction
finally let loose, unloading the stockpile
a mental projectile, i aim at the reptile
i look to the one handed juggler and ask him this
"why is it you insist upon stepping to an octopus?"
is there a reason for this? the hindrance is aggravating
how many times will it take you before you realize you're fading?
fading from existence, cause simulations are dead
there's so much more to learn and pages left to be read
so put up the front while you jam for the grammar that's poor
while i hold the scrapbook that's heavier than the hammer of the mighty thor
words can weigh a ton
therefore it's never to fall into the hands of the wrong one
