chauvinist pig, drove in this big lincoln
'til it went over the bridge
jumped out and dove in the ditch
broke in a mobile home and stole a stove and a fridge
kidnapped the parents and left the ransom note for the kids
i'ma go for your mids, here's a body blow for your ribs
while you're clutchin' your stomach
and bleedin' all over your bitch
i know where you live, your girl showed me your crib
unless she told me a fib, then i'ma have both of you did
burning incense, facin' a murder sentence
under intense investigation for killin' infants
while i sit in padded rooms, doin' shrooms
havin' visions of dead pregnant women
with brooms jabbed in they wombs
slit your carpet and rugs and fuck your apartment up
stickin' up arbor drugs, and jumpin' in garbage trucks
i'm from the shitty slums that look like the city dumps
give you a kidney punch and mug you to get me lunch
see me every summer layin' up against the dumpster
with a hundred dollar jumper, smothered in southern comfort
got my slim shady sticker on your mother's bumper
she came home screamin' a bunch of motherfuckers jumped her
