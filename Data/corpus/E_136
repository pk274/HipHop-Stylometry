lately it seems as if it's me against the world
like it was before my life became a movie
and they used to use my mothafuckin' trailer to tease me with
but i flipped that script like a refill of
painkillers to pop the lid off that safety seal (ha)
it made me feel amazing, navy seal of bravery
and if i may reiterate, i ain't even need a script
ain't bein' conceited, but i made it to radio—eat a dick!
i still never abc this shit
mainstream appeal, but the skill is what made me iller
since before they called jay dee "dilla"
i was daydreamin' one day i would be the shit
and if i ever end up escapin' these streets
i swear that i would stay here still
and if i'm crazy, i'll always be real
don't make me steal an eighteen-wheeler
break all of my friends out of here
and take 'em straight to the mercedes dealer
peel off back to the same block that we came from
on a rampage too crazy for me to flip
what's makin' you think i need a switch?
‘cause i'm adrian peterson
when he's ragin' and heated and
on the way to go beat his kid?
on a track get spanked like he just did
(detroit!) i can't never leave this bitch
sick of bein' treated like we ain't shit
but jesus, i can see just why people quit callin' me
to do features and them cyphers on bet, ‘cause if
i wasn't me i prob'ly wouldn't
wanna play with me neither, shit
seems to be reachin' its fever pitch
hundred and eighty degrees in here
shoulder blade full of cedar chips
mc's just bit off more than they can chew
like a face full of swedish fish
or lorena with two penises
hateful and geniusness inconvenience
and for the record, you don't want this type of static
in your life, when i'm makin' you cling to it
may consider tryna reinsulate your windows
may be in for another crazy winter
‘cause so cold in the d, it is
as days begin to tick away, but ain't this really
what made me into the angry bitter blonde?
but ain't we sick of bein' underdogs?
don't make me unleash this shit, release this pit
may even seem as if i'm yankin' your chain a bit
or maybe the way in which i'm sayin' shit
is playin' with you, but ain't shit changin'
it's still the same shit and shady's still a lady killer
since the day i went insane and then attacked the babysitter
with a potato peeler
and mushed her face into the entertainment center
it's like another plane just entered into ukraine again
or the bermuda triangle and
attempted to make a safe descent
awaiting anyone who ain't affiliated, it could be danger
did you make arrangements with the gangsters 'fore you came here? and if they mention us…
