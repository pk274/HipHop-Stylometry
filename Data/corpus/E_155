ayo, yo, this is motherfuckin' eminem
dirty dozen, 'bout to show you
how we set it when we come through
know what i'm sayin'?
word up, bitch-motherfuckers better raise up
y'all motherfuckers better raise up!
ayo, buss it! ayoâ€¦


i'm a pit bull terrier, triple darin' ya
scarin' ya with a derringer
ready to make you wet like a submariner
tearin' ya frame out with homicidal lines
bringin' the drama and the trauma to your mama's vital signs (blaow!) a verbal shot fired, this mic's been hot wired
uppercuts to your chin, knockin' your snot skyward
rappers wanna be screenplay actors
so i'm givin' they spine fractures
like linebackers from the green bay packers
and roll over 'em backwards, dirty dozen
i'm someone you just don't wanna see, like a nerdy cousin
so keep your distance when i get this tense
you see my fist clench? it's gonna be some bullets dispensed
you best to keep your premises fenced
you missed hints, any resistance
get you voided like misprints
you'll end up with no teeth left makin' a beef threat
when i roll up on your set
don't get it twisted like keith sweat


when i get to bustin', you best to get to jumpin'
i'm touchin' somethin'
fool, i'm comin' through dumpin'
my beat's bumpin', you hear it thumpin'?
that oughta tell you somethin'
bitch, i'm comin' through dumpin'
bullets hit you, your heart stops pumpin'
your blood starts clumpin'
i'm comin' through dumpin'
if you don't know, you best make an assumption
i got you slumpin'
fool, i'm comin' through dumpin'


when i get to bustin', you best to get to jumpin'
i'm touchin' somethin'

bitch, i'm comin' through dumpin'
bullets hit you, your heart stops pumpin'
