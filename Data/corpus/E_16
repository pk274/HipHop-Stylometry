went to bible class with a gun, blasted a nun
fuck hell, satan sent my ass to the sun
i wasn't born, i was hatched, dumped in the trash
with a note attached sayin', "someone please whip this brat's ass!"
i never gave a rat's ass or a flyin' fuck
drivin' drunk in a fire truck with the siren stuck
slammin' the brakes, skiddin' out, ‘cause the tires suck
went to pull you off my dick and got the pliers stuck
you better run, ‘cause i'm probably the only one
crazy enough to shoot your ass with a knife and stab you with a gun
i like fire, you might see me start it
i'm slightly retarded, i miss my sanity since the night we departed
