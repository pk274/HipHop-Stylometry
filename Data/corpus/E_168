let's take them back to the future (bars)
bars, like paul rosenberg
the small frozen turd (don't censor me man)
alright look, i had class, i just got expelled
i excelled at nothing in school
so if you're tryna test my patience it just failed
but king mathers, i still get hailed
so call me sire, like i exhaled
after i had a deep ass breath held
i guess well, that'll make my size double xl
so kiss your highness's hinded ass
while i'm trying to stretch, it's time to exercise
i'm flexing, isometrics
twice the reps 'til i get extra-sized
and set my bis and pecs and triceps on fire
cause i'm coming out guns blazing
like flaming pythons, my suggestion is parental discretion
be advised, due to this mental aggression
we advise you to back up, like byron leftwich
i'm infectious, i rhyme like i got a sinus infection
a virus, i'm congested and i just ingested
five allegras but the side effects from these anti-depressants, they're tryna mess with my mind
i'm a regular hyde and jekyll
white with freckles but i silence hecklers
you might wanna head for the fire exits
i'm coming through like a wrecking ball
you would swear i think highly of miley
and i respect her, the way i backhand her
excuse my french, montana, but i am worried about nutting
god damn it, i'm a sexist, i drive a lexus
textses out of her mind, and i'm in texas
with a chainsaw, wait, what did i forget this
time, oh, my machetes getting upset, he said
he was ready for me to come get him from inside the shed
it was time, he's restless
he wants to make blood shed like a storage unit
but before i do it, let me think this through
cause if i behead this bitch then i'd be headless
