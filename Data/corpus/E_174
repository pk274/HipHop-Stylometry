i stimulate the brain, mimic, emulate the sane
cynics keep on thinkin' it's a fuckin' gimmick when it ain't
clinically insane, brain is on venus, up uranus
label me a genius if you ever seen us you would say
"he may seem as though he's plain normal" if you ever meet him
greet him with a shake, see he ain't as mean as what they say
see the thing is maybe he can't always think of things to say
so he's vague, so they mistake him for just bein' crazed
you part ways, your impression of him changed
you don't think he's strange, you turn around and tell him; "peace and thanks"
you catch him flippin' you off, with his pants down
hands around his scrotum, tuckin' his fuckin' penis between his legs


it's all psychologic, why am i so maniacal?
am i a psycho or some kind of psychotic shtick?
or am i truly psychotic? or my molecules just diabolical?
'cause biologically, i defy logic, by golly, haul me off on a trolley
probably want a quack, or i'm back on that whacky tobacca
i'ma step away from crack, obie smacked the shit out of me
i'm so slap happy, man, snap me back to reality
i'm a walkin' art gallery, a science museum
elephantitis of the nuts, you'd probably die if you see them
i pull them out, they hit the ground and probably crack the cement
i need an ambulance, i can't just put them back in my pants (help me!)
