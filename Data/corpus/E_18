good morning! ha-ha!
wake your motherfucking asses up!
are y'all with us or what?
well, come on then, you know what time it is
stop sleeping on my group, bitch!


for whatever it's worth it's worth me havin' my ass whipped
'cause i'ma have the last lips to ever kiss ass with
i just can't get past these little piss ants
that wanna be brawny bad asses so bad
and they so mad, they can't stand it
'cause we can and they can't spit
and they can't handle it like a man
and that's when it just happens
and i snap, and it's a wrap, and it's scrap, and then it isn't rap, is it?
hip-hop isn't a sport anymore when you gotta go and resort back into that shit
maybe i'm old-fashioned, but my passion is to smash anyone rappin' without havin' to slap him
believe me, i'd much rather lift a pencil than a pistol when i'm pissed now
but it all depends on just how far it gets took on the mic
'cause i'm tellin' you right now, you're not gonna like it
'cause if i get pushed over the edge then i'm pullin' you with me
you poke a stick at a pit bull, you get bit, b
these words stick to you like krazy glue when you diss me
'cause they just bounce off me, like bullets to 50
i'm the beautiful-lest thing and you gonna miss me when i'm gone
like keith murray when he threw a stool and hit a girl accidentally
i do this for swifty, kon and kuniva, bizzy and proof, are you with me?


come on then, everybody come on and
kick your shoes off motherfuckers, come on in
'cause we get it on until the break of dawn and
wake your ass up motherfuckers, quit yawning
'cause we ain't leaving 'til 6 in the morning
so have a sing along with the words of the song and
if you don't know the words, and you can't sing along, then
fake like you know 'em motherfuckers and join in
everybody, good morning!
