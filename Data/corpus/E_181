i should've been able to see that you were the one behind this
but i was blind as fuck to think that you
weren't the kind that stuck some one in the spine this
it was as if our friendship broke in half
and i watch you turn everything into a game and joke and laugh
and both of us know we can't discuss the situation like adults
each confrontation just results in accusations and insults
so i'ma just let it go for now, and leave you be
it's over now; what goes around comes back around
believe you me, lay low for now; come here, you fuckin'…


why don't you take a second to stop
and think about what you done
and you want to call that "being a friend"
that isn't what you want
all because of what, you run your mouth
you wanna prance around and gloat?
let's see how well you dance around
when i got my hands around your throat
'cause it's a matter of time 'til i get my blows in
and it won't be long
you shouldn't go walkin' around
and stickin' your nose in where it don't belong
'cause every time you talked
when you was stretchin' the truth
there's gonna be one more flyin' knuckle
you're gonna catch in the tooth
look it, come here, you fuckin'…


come here, you little double-crossing
going-behind-my-back snitcher
good-for-nothin'-but-trouble-causin', instigatin' fact switcher
you were the least that i suspected
'til the puzzle fell into place with every piece that i selected
but i'll never let that crap happen again
you come back blabbin' again
catch it smack dab in the chin; that's for backstabbin' a friend
'cause every name in the book wouldn't be enough
so i just figured i'd say your name in the hook
check it out, come here, you fuckin'…
