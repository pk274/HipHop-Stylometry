yeah, this game has got me goin' crazy
fuck it, i am crazy, what's new?
what kind of fuckin' glue you think i’d be if i was glue?
we lost proof, he was our group's glue but where was you
when we were falling apart? you were shittin' on us too
but no one but us knew we were beefing 'cause that's what happens
when you beef with crew, it stays in your crew 'cause it's just crew
but we're back now, yeah, we took our time but in one crew
only thing we're in a hurry for now is to rush you
and we're back to say shit you don't got the guts or the nuts to
pussy, go pick your pussy leaves off your cunt tree, fuck you
achoo, bless you, i’m allergic to pussy
sluts too, yeah, you think you’re the shit 'til we flush you
had some bullshit to readjust to
now there's just a few of us left, but it’d be unjust to rob us our just due
so rest in peace to bugz and proof, this one's for you homies, we love you
but we can’t stop now, we done had too much of our blood drew from this...
