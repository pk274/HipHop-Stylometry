catch me in my mercedes, bumpin' "ice ice baby"
screaming, "shady 'til i die!"
like a half a pair of dice, life's crazy
so i live it to the fullest 'til i'm swayze
and you only live it once, so i'm thinking 'bout this nice, nice lady
wait, no, stop me now 'fore i get on a roll (danish)
let me tell you what this pretty little dame's name is 'cause she's kinda famous
and i hope that i don't sound too heinous when i say this
nicki minaj, but i wanna stick my penis in your anus
you morons think that i'm a genius
really, i belong inside a dang insane asylum
came to drive them trailer parks crazy
i am back, and i am razor-sharp, baby
and that's "back" with a capital b with an exclamation mark
maybe you should listen when i flip the linguistics
‘cause i wanna rip this mystical slick shit
you don't wanna become another victim, a statistic of this shit
‘cause after i spit the bullets, i'ma treat these shell casings like a soccer ball
i'ma kick the ballistics; so get this dick, i'ma live this—


uh, yeah, my whole goal as a poet's to be relaxed in orbit
at war with a bottle as captain morgan attacks my organs (c'mon)
my slow flow is euphoric, it's like i rap endorphins (woo)
i made a pact with the devil that says
"i'll let you take me, you let me take a shovel
dig up the corpse of jack kevorkian" (c'mon)
go back and forthin', more beef than you can pack a fork in
i'm livin' the life of the infinite enemy, down
my tenement chimney now, the semi’s the remedy, pow
spin him around, enterin' in the vicinity now

was called m&m, but he threw away the candy and ate the rapper
chewed him up (*ptt*), and spitted him out
girl, giddy-up, now get-get down
he's lookin' around this club
and it looks like people are havin' a shit-fit now
yeah, little tr-tr-trailer trash, take a look who's back in t-t-town
did i st-st-stutter, motherfucker?
fuck the mall, he shuts the whole motherfuckin' walmart
d-d-down every time he comes a-r-r-round
and he came to the club tonight with 5'9" to hold this bitch down
like a motherfuckin' chick underwater he's tryin' to dr-dr-drown
shorty, when you dance, you got me captivated
just by the way that you keep lickin' them dick-suckin' lips
i'm agitated, aggravated
to the point you don't suck my dick
then you're gonna get decapitated
other words, you don't fuckin' give me head
then i'ma have to take it


and then after takin' that i'ma catch a case, it's gon' be fascinatin'
it's gon' say the whole rap game passed away on top of the affidavit
graduated from master debater, slash massive masturbator
to michael jackson's activator (woo)
meanin' i'm on fire off the top, might wanna back up data
rollin' over hip-hop in a verbal tractor trailer
homie, they sick, you could normally ask a hater
don't it make sense?
that these shell casings is just like a bag of paper
dropped in the lap of a tax evader, homie, they spent


now make that ass drop like a sack of potatoes (what?)
girl, i'm the crack-a-lator, percolator of this party
be my penis ejaculator later
tell your boyfriend that you just struck paydirt
you rollin' with a player
you won't be exaggeratin' when you say you're livin'


i'm livin' life in the fast lane (ayy)
movin' at the speed of life and i can't slow down
only got a gallon in the gas tank (oh)
but i'm almost at the finish line, so i can't stop now (yeah)
i don't really know where i'm headed (no), just enjoyin' the ride (yeah)
just gon' roll 'til i drop (oh) and ride 'til i die (ah-ah)
i'm livin' life in the fast lane (pedal to the metal)
i'm livin' life in the fast lane (pedal to the metal) (haha) (woo)
