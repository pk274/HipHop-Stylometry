this kind of music, use it, and you get amped to do shit
whenever you hear some shit and you can't refuse it
it's just some shit for these kids to trash they rooms with
just refuse whenever they asked to do shit
the type of shit that you don't have to ask who produced it
you just know that's the new shit
the type of shit that causes mass-confusion
and drastic movement of people actin' stupid


you know why my hands are so numb? (no)
'cause my grandmother sucked my dick and i didn't cum (oh)
smacked this whore for talkin' crap (bitch!)
so what if she's handicapped? (what?)
the bitch said, "bizarre couldn't rap" (ha-ha!)
i fuckin' hate you, i'll take your drawers down and rape you
while dr. dre videotapes you (hell yeah!)
satan done got me on this song, eatin' a hot-dog
readin' the holy qur'an while i'm on the john
tired of wearin' this yellow thong
take it back, sisqo, you know where it belongs
now, here's a gun, i'll put it in your palm
now go over there and blow up dru hill's arms
fuck the love songs!

i'm a nigga that loves scuffles
and won't hesitate to sock you again with swollen knuckles
i'm like that, catch a nigga like bear traps
blow his head back
right in front of the precinct (you hear that?)
i slap your freak, bump you and won't speak
if you step on my feet, you get drowned in your own drink
i suffocated my shrink just for talkin'
came back and fucked up his pallbearers
and made them drop his coffin; it's fight music


if i could capture the rage of today's youth and bottle it
crush the glass with my bare hands and swallow it
and spit it back in the faces of you racists
and hypocrites who think the same shit but don't say shit
you liberaces, versaces, and you nazis
watch me, 'cause you figured you got me in this hot seat
you motherfuckers wanna judge me 'cause you're not me
you'll never stop me, i'm top speed and you pop me
i came to save these new generations of babies
from parents who failed to raise them 'cause they're lazy
to grow to praise me, i'm makin' them go crazy
that's how i got this whole nation to embrace me
and you fugazi if you think i'ma admit wrong
i cripple any hypocritic critic i'm sicked on
and this song is for any kid who gets picked on
a sick song to retaliate to, and it's calledâ€”
