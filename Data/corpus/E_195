i have the right to remain violent
any rhyme that i say can and will be used against you
icicle veins, mics'll get slain
like they were strangled with bicycle chains
you’re gonna have to come identify the remains
wait, what?
i said my head is twisted like a bread tie (yup)

heard you're back with the doctor," then i heard
