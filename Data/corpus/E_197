just a bunch of gibberish
and motherfuckers act like they forgot about dre

so what do you say to somebody you hate (what?)
or anyone tryna bring trouble your way?
wanna resolve things in a bloodier way? (yup)
just study a tape of n.w.a
one day i was walkin' by
with a walkman on, when i caught a guy
gave me an awkward eye ('chu lookin' at?)
and strangled him up in the parking lot with his karl kani
i don't give a fuck if it's dark or not
i'm harder than me tryna park a dodge
when i'm drunk as fuck
right next to a humongous truck in a two-car garage
hoppin' out with two broken legs tryna walk it off
fuck you too, bitch, call the cops
i'ma kill you and them loud-ass motherfuckin' barkin' dogs
and when the cops came through
me and dre stood next to a burnt-down house
with a can full of gas and a hand full of matches
and still weren't found out (right here!)
so from here on out, it's the chronic ii
startin' today and tomorrow's anew
and i'm still loco enough to choke you to death with a charleston chew
chicka-chicka-chicka slim shady
hotter than a set of twin babies
in a mercedes benz with the windows up
when the temp goes up to the mid-80s
callin' men ladies
sorry doc, but i been crazy
there's no way that you can save me
it's okay, go with him, hailie (dada?)
