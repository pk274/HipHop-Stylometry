these are the results of a thousand electric volts
a neck with bolts
nurse, we're losin' him, check the pulse
a kid who refused to respect adults
wore spectacles with taped frames and a freckled nose
a corny-lookin' white boy, scrawny and always ornery
'cause i was always sick of brawny bullies pickin' on me
and i might snap, one day just like that
i decided to strike back, and flatten every tire on the bike rack
my first day in junior high, this kid said
"it's you and i, three o'clock sharp, this afternoon you die"
i looked at my watch, it was 1:20
"i already gave you my lunch money
what more do you want from me?"
he said, "don't try to run from me, you'll just make it worse"
my palms were sweaty, and i started to shake at first
somethin' told me, "try to fake a stomach ache, it works"
i screamed, "ow, my appendix feel like they could burst
teacher, teacher, quick, i need a naked nurse"
"what's the matter?"
"i don't know, my leg, it hurts"
"leg? i thought you said it was your tummy"
"oh, i mean it is, but i also got a bum knee"
"mr. mathers, the fun and games are over
and just for that stunt, you're gonna get some extra homework"
"but don't you wanna give me after school detention?"
"nah, that bully wants to beat your ass and i'ma let him"


brain damage, ever since the day i was born
drugs is what they used to say i was on
they say i never knew which way i was goin'
but everywhere i go, they keep playin' my song

brain damage


way before my baby daughter hailie
i was harassed daily by this fat kid named deangelo bailey
an eighth grader who acted obnoxious, 'cause his father boxes
so every day he'd shove me in the lockers
one day he came in the bathroom while i was pissin'
and had me in the position to beat me into submission
he banged my head against the urinal 'til he broke my nose
soaked my clothes in blood, grabbed me and choked my throat
i tried to plead and tell him we shouldn't beef
but he just wouldn't leave
he kept chokin' me and i couldn't breathe
he looked at me and said, "you gonna die, honky"
the principal walked in and started helpin' him stomp me
(what's going on in here?)
i made 'em think they beat me to death
holdin' my breath for like five minutes before they finally left
then i got up and ran to the janitor's storage booth
kicked the door hinge loose and ripped out the four-inch screws
grabbed some sharp objects, brooms and foreign tools
this is for every time you took my orange juice
or stole my seat in the lunchroom and drank my chocolate milk
every time you tipped my tray and it dropped and spilt
i'm gettin' you back, bully, now once and for good
i cocked the broomstick back and swung hard as i could
and beat him over the head with it 'til i broke the wood
knocked him down, stood on his chest with one foot
made it home later that same day
started readin' a comic, and suddenly everything became gray
i couldn't even see what i was tryin' to read
i went deaf and my left ear started to bleed
my mother started screamin', "what are you on, drugs?!
look at you, you're gettin' blood all over my rug" (i'm sorry)
she beat me over the head with the remote control
opened a hole and my whole brain fell out of my skull
i picked it up and screamed, "look, bitch, what have you done?"
"oh my god, i'm sorry, son"
shut up, you cunt
i said fuck it, took it and stuck it back up in my head
then i sewed it shut and put a couple of screws in my neck


brain damage, ever since the day i was born
drugs is what they used to say i was on
they say i never knew which way i was goin'
but everywhere i go, they keep playin' my song
brain damage, ever since the day i was born
drugs is what they used to say i was on

brain damage, it's brain damage
i got brain damage, it's brain damage
it's probably brain damage, it's brain damage
brain damage, i got brain damage

my name is marshall mathers, i'm an alcoholic (hi, marshall)

so when you see me on yo' block with two glocks
screamin', "fuck the world" like 2pac

tellin' your boys that i'm on crack

so put my tape back on the rack
go run and tell your friends my shit is wack
i just don't give a fuck
but see me on the street and duck
'cause you gon' get stuck, stole, and snuffed
'cause i just don't give a fuck


i'm nicer than pete, but i'm on a search to crush a milkbone
i'm everlastin', i melt vanilla ice like silicone
i'm ill enough to just straight up diss you for no reason
i'm colder than snow season when it's twenty below freezin'
flavor with no seasoning, this is the sneak preview
i'll diss yo' magazine and still won't get a weak review
i'll make yo' freak leave you, smell the folgers crystals
this is lyrical combat, gentlemen, hold your pistols
while i form like voltron and blast you with my shoulder missiles
slim shady, m&m was the old initials (bye-bye)
extortion, snortin', supportin' abortion
pathological liar, blowin' shit outta proportion
the looniest, zaniest, spontaneous, sporadic
impulsive thinker, compulsive drinker, addict
half animal, half man
dumpin' yo' dead body inside of a fuckin' trash can
with more holes than an afghan

somebody let me out this limousine (hey, let me out)
i'm a caged demon
on stage screamin' like rage against the machine
i'm convinced i'm a fiend
shootin' up while this record is spinnin'
clinically brain-dead, i don't need a second opinion
fuck droppin' a jewel, i'm flippin' a sacred treasure
i'll bite yo' motherfuckin' style just to make it fresher
i can't take the pressure, i'm sick of bitches
sick of naggin' bosses bitchin' while i'm washin' dishes
in school, i never said much, too busy havin' a head rush
doin' too much rush, had my face flushed like red blush
then i went to jim beam, that's when my face grayed
went to gym in eighth grade, **** the women's swim team
don't take me for a joke, i'm no comedian
too many mental problems got me snortin' coke and smokin' weed again
i'm goin' up over the curb, drivin' on the median
finally made it home but i don't got the key to get in


so when you see me on yo' block with two glocks

and i'ma always be here for you
(just the two of us, just the two of us)

come on hai-hai, we goin' to the beach
grab a couple of toys and let dada strap you in the car seat
oh, where's mama? she's takin' a little nap in the trunk
oh, that smell? dada musta runned over a skunk
now, i know what you're thinkin', it's kinda late to go swimmin'
but you know your mama, she's one of those type of women
that do crazy things, and if she don't get her way she'll throw a fit
don't play with dada's toy knife, honey, let go of it! (no!)
and don't look so upset, why you actin' bashful?
don't you wanna help dada build a sandcastle? (yeah!)
and mama said she wants to show you how far she can float
and don't worry about that little boo-boo on her throat
it's just a little scratch – it don't hurt
her was eatin' dinner while you were sweepin'
and spilled ketchup on her shirt
mama's messy, ain't she? we'll let her wash off in the water
and me and you can play by ourselves, can't we?


just the two of us, just the two of us
and when we ride
just the two of us, just the two of us
just you and i
just the two of us, just the two of us
and when we ride
just the two of us, just the two of us
just you and i (see, honey)


there's a place called heaven and a place called hell
a place called prison and a place called jail
and dada's probably on his way to all of 'em except one
‘cause mama's got a new husband and a stepson
and you don't want a brother, do ya? (nah)
maybe when you're old enough
to understand a little better, i'll explain it to ya
but for now we'll just say mama was real, real bad
she was bein' mean to dad and made him real, real mad
but i still feel sad that i put her on timeout
sit back in your chair, honey, quit tryna climb out!
i told you it's okay, hai-hai, want a ba-ba?
take a night-night? na-na-boo, goo-goo ga-ga?
her make poo-poo ca-ca? dada change your didee
clean the baby up so her can take a nighty-nighty
your dad'll wake her up as soon as we get to the water
'97 bonnie and clyde, me and my daughter


just the two of us, just the two of us
and when we ride
just the two of us, just the two of us
just you and i
just the two of us, just the two of us
and when we ride
just the two of us, just the two of us
just you and i


wake up, sweepyhead, we're here, before we pway
we're gonna take mama for a wittle walk along the pier
baby, don't cry, honey, don't get the wrong idea
mama's too sweepy to hear you screamin' in her ear (mama)
that's why you can't get her to wake, but don't worry
dada made a nice bed for mommy at the bottom of the lake
here, you wanna help dada tie a rope around this rock? (yea)
we'll tie it to her footsie then we'll roll her off the dock
ready now, here we go, on the count of free
one, two, free — whee!
there goes mama, spwashin' in the water
no more fightin' with dad, no more restrainin' order
no more stepdada, no more new brother
blow her kisses bye-bye, tell mama you love her (mommy)
now we'll go play in the sand, build a castle and junk
but first, just help dad with two more things out the trunk


just the two of us, just the two of us
and when we ride
just the two of us, just the two of us
just you and i
just the two of us, just the two of us
and when we ride
just the two of us, just the two of us
just you and i


(just the two of us, just the two of us)
just me and you, baby, is all we need in this world
(just the two of us, just the two of us)
just me and you
your dada will always be there for you
your dada's always gonna love you, remember that
if you ever need me i will always be here for you
if you ever need anything, just ask
dada will be right there
your dada loves you
i love you, baby

hand me an eighth, beam me up and land me in space
i'ma sit on top of the world and spit on brandy & mase
i'm more than ill, scarier than a white person trapped in a room with lauryn hill
human horror film, but with a lot funnier plot
and people will feel me 'cause i'ma still be the mad rapper whether i got money or not
as long as i'm on pills and i got plenty of pot
i'll be in a canoe paddling, making fun of your yacht
but i would like an award
for the best rapper to get 1 mic in the source
and a wardrobe i can afford
otherwise i might just end up back striking at ford
and you wonder what the hell i need more vicodin for?
everybody's pissing me off
even the no limit tank looks like a middle finger sideways
flipping me off
no wonder i'm a grave danger to my health
why else would i kill you and jump in the grave and bury myself?


are you afraid of a blade made of a razor with aids blood
dripping from it ripping your stomach up from the waist up?
you talk a lot of junk but you was never ill though
i'm strong enough to beat you to death with a feather pillow
tipped over some cows just for joke and a laugh
jumped up choked a giraffe snapped his neck and broke it in half
waging wars, went up stage and sprayed cage with agent orange
and whipe my ass with his page in source
the demon is here i'm steaming this year
i rip mystical's voicebox out and scream in his ear
it's not a gimmick trick it's an image i live it
give a damn i don't know what a damn is to give it
man i don't think this guy is well, i'm high as hell
i beat you with a live cat when i'm swinging him by he's tail
i'll freaking, i'll freaking
laying your nuts on a dresser, just a nutsack by itself and bang dem stuffs with a spiked bat
cut ya neck off and glue your head right back and leave you like that
you just triggered a prick who just mixed liquor who's itching and to leave you disfigured and stiffer than chris-topher
reeves i was teething with strep throat when you're mother was breastfeeding and gave it a flesh-eating disease
i'm iller than taking a hammer and beating your knees and walk trough south central la bleeding in jeans
flashin back to being shot and repeatin the scenes
on how you just got smoked, and if you do live
you'll be too scared to tell it, like a biggie and 'pac joke


the one man on the planet that'll drive off of the grand canyon
hop out of a grand am and land in it handstandin'
any man plannin' to battle'll get snatched outta his clothes
so fast it'll look like an invisible man standin'
i'm headed for hell, i'd rather be dead or in jail
bill clinton, hit this — and you better inhale!
‘cause any mc that chooses to go against me
is gettin' taken advantage of, like monica lewinsky
came home in a frenzy, pushin' a ten speed
screamin' to aunt peg
with three spokes stickin' outta my pant leg
forget a headache! give me a migraine, damn it, i like pain
and you should be anywhere that a mic ain't
you rap knowin' you wack
you act up and i'm throwin' you down a flight of steps
then i'm throwin' you back up 'em
if they don't like the track, 'uck 'em! the rap struck 'em
harder than gettin' hit by a mack truck and then backed up on
and any half-assed known rapper to trespass
better be ready for the second celebrity deathmatch
so tell the medic to bring the medication and quickly
i'm sicker than a 2pac dedication to biggie
i'm free-fallin' feet first out of a damn tree
to stampede your chest 'til you can't breathe
and when i'm down to my last breath
i'ma climb the empire state building
and get to the last step and still have half left
