what i wanna do? what i wanna do?
let me see right here, yo


not many people that i label would be able
to display table manners, but our plan is
to make this beat rock like scanners and make the fans just
go bananas, yo, get our planners
that means our nuts for the sluts who don't under-
stand this, yo, my plan is, yeah right
and y'all gon' stand there and act like you don't understand it
like my name is janet, my titty fell out and i ain't plan it
yo, check this—check this out
and if you rocking with ya necklace out, that's my breakfast now
i'mma snatch it, yo, my style is wretched
you can't fetch it, no you can't stretch it
and yo, it doesn't really matter
cause ya name i can't even pronunciate, you the—
same type of mo'fucker to go and sucker
punch dre at the vibe awards, but he right behind the boards
the next day, so kiss an ass
or kiss a dick, lick a dick, eat my ass
whatever you won' do it's on you
big proof coming through with the mo—


aftermath in the house now
get yo' fricking mouth stabbed out
y'all get so mad
get so livid
looking for dap from anyone who would give it
now how you gon' value
someone else's opinion
cause you selfish
i'm rap's elvis
everybody try to grab the helm-ets and they hardhats
run and duck for cover
yo, fuck ya mother
what the fuck are ya?
yo, i'm sprayin'
while i'm playin'
i ain't playin'
i'm sprayin' at your feet
like hey imma cock the hand
imma pull my cock out
outta my pajamas
and cock back the cock
like it's chicken
yo, check it out
the clock is ticking
it's countdown to armageddon
and there's nothing you can do to stop it
put your arm or head in
or put a pen in it
but once the grenade pin is pulled
it's nothing you could do
but end up in the hospital
yeah, yeah
hospital, pital, 'spitals
end up in the 'spital
and y'all can eat my tender vittles
i don't really give a fudge
fudge, fudge-packers
is what y'all are
and y'all get smacked up
at the awards show
however you want it to go
we can make it go either way
biatch
that's itch-bay backwards
f around and smack turds
they told us not to use no cuss words
so we gon' not use cuss words
and say busters instead
have you all bleeding red
damn, right out of yo' head
that's what i said
and my name ain't fred
my name ain't special ed
and it ain't my birthday
but proof can get on the mic in the worst way
and i don't even have to curse to say


acid rap
yeah and that's a fact
slim shady's back
got eighty ladies layin' on they back
yo, but i'm a mack
i'm a little nuts for brittany
little to sane for whitney
tell you the truth
yo, bobby would prolly get me
catch me in the lobby
after he just hit me
after he sniffed three lines
he'd prolly knock out fifty
he could prolly lift up both of us
and spin us both on both fingers like donuts
yo, i party hard
but for real, i want bobby brown as my bodyguard
and that's for real
and that's the deal
cause we got mass appeal
and i don't think that they can really take it
cause i always let my nuts hang
like i was doing push-ups naked
that's what i do
is drink the alizé and
then i pass it to my man proof and
then we start goofin' around
and start spoofin'
everybody, yo we in the party
and we could rock the party
and we could get it started
and if ya smell like (sniff)
somebody farted
or we can
we can do the mardi gardy
we could party harder
we could get started
what you wanna do
proof, it's on you


that's what's up
pass this cup
and then we blast you up
freestyle right off the massive truck
we got truckloads
and uff, no
cuff no and spin it backwards
and play it back later
cause all y'all haters rockin' gators
alligators, we see ya later
we ain't player haters
but yo check it out
we rockin' in our navigators
and we can sit back
and we can stretch, we can check
trek, i mean catch, anything
and we can fetch
i'm slurring a little bit
but during the part that i was doing
the urination, upon that girl and
wait a minute, i ain't goin'
there with my rap
i ain't tryin' to be starting no crap
but yo, i be flowin'
with the stuff and i be knowin'
that when i start raking out them leaves
i be hoein'
and that's six in the mornin'
and we can do it
we can get it on until the crack of dawn and
we can get it on with tim westwood
we can do whatever you want
bring ya best cause
we do what we want to do
on this microphone
cause we ought to know
or ought to inform you
that we get warm too warm
sometimes we too hot to
not to spit this ish
spit it backwards and that said shit
whoops, i didn't mean to curse
but yo proof, come back
and lay one verse


how you know the main side, so attraction
psycho action
the man 'ill throw up on michael jackson
sick enough to do anything
in any video

woo
fuck is wrong with you?
hah

i don't understand
why are you being so mean?
you're a mean, mean man


you're just jealous of me 'cause you, you just can't do what i do
so instead of just admitting it, you walk around and say
all kinds of really mean things about me
'cause you're a meanie, a meanie
but it's only 'cause you're just really jealous of me
'cause i'm what you wanna be, so you just look like an idiot
when you say these mean things, 'cause it's too easy to see
you're really just a big weenie, big weenie


alright, listen, i need you to focus
i need you to go dig deep in your mind, this is important
we are going to perform an experiment of the sorts
i'm going to have to ask you to bear with me for a moment
now i need you to open your mind, your eyes, close 'em
you are now about to be placed under my hypnosis
for the next four and a half minutes, we are going to explore
into your mind to find out why you're so fucking jealous
now why did they make yoo-hoo? pippity-kaka-poo-poo
psych, i'm kidding, i just wanted to see if you're still listening
okay, now i need your undivided attention
sir, i have a question, why do i always sense this undeniable tension?
from the moment that i enter into the room it gets all quiet and whispers
whenever there's conversation, why am i always mentioned?
i've been dying to ask, it's been itching at me, is it just because...


you're just jealous of me 'cause you, you just can't do what i do
so instead of just admitting it, you walk around and say
all kinds of really mean things about me
'cause you're a meanie, a meanie
but it's only 'cause you're just really jealous of me
'cause i'm what you wanna be, so you just look like an idiot
when you say these mean things, 'cause it's too easy to see
you're really just a big weenie, big weenie


alright now i (shit), i just flubbed a line
i was going to say something extremely important
but i forgot who or what it was, i fucked up
psych, i'm kidding again, you idiot, no, i didn't
that's just what you wanted to hear from me is that i fucked up, ain't it?
but i can bust one take without looking at no paper
it doesn't take a bunch of takes or me to stand here in this booth all day
for me to say the truth, okay? you're drooling, you have tooth decay
your mouth is open, you're disgusting, what the fuck you eat for lunch?
a bunch of sweets or something? what, you munch a bunch of crunch 'n munch?
your tooth is rotten to the gum, your breath stinks, wanna chew some gum?
"yes, i do, sir, what am i on?" you, sir, are on truth serum
"marshall, i'm so jealous of you, please say you won't tell nobody
i'd be so embarrassed, i'm just absolutely terrified
that someone's gonna find out why i'm saying all these terrible
evil and awful mean things, it's my own insecurities"


you're just jealous of me 'cause you, you just can't do what i do
so instead of just admitting it, you walk around and say
all kinds of really mean things about me
'cause you're a meanie, a meanie
but it's only 'cause you're just really jealous of me
'cause i'm what you wanna be, so you just look like an idiot
when you say these mean things, 'cause it's too easy to see
you're really just a big weenie, big weenie


alright, now we, we're going to conduct
that experiment that we were talking about earlier
just to see what a frog looks like when it takes two hits of ecstasy
'cause that's exactly what your eyes look like, wanna check to see?
here's a mirror, notice the resemblance here?
wait, let me put these sunglasses on, now look in this mirror
how 'bout now? what do you have in common?
you're both green with envy and look like idiots with sunglasses on 'em
you look like i sound like singing about weenies
now take my weenie out of your mouth
this is between me and you, i know you're not happy
i know you'd much rather see me lying in the corner of a room somewhere crying
curled up in a ball, tweaked out of my mind, dying, there's no denying
that my weenie is much bigger than yours is
mine is like sticking a banana between two oranges
why are you even doing this to yourself? it's pointless
why do we have to keep on going through this? this is torturous
my point is this
that if you say mean things, your weenie will shrink
now i forgot what the chorus is, you're just as...


you're just jealous of me 'cause you, you just can't do what i do
so instead of just admitting it, you walk around and say
all kinds of really mean things about me
'cause you're a meanie, a meanie
but it's only 'cause you're just really jealous of me
'cause i'm what you wanna be, so you just look like an idiot
when you say these mean things, 'cause it's too easy to see
you're really just a big weenie, big weenie


fuck off my dick

can't you see what you do to me, baby?
you make me crazy, you make me act like a maniac
i'm like a lunatic, you make me sick
you're truly the only one who can do this to me
you just make me get so crazy
i go schizo, i get so insane, i just go schizophrenic
one minute i wanna slit your throat, the next i wanna sex
you make me crazy, the way we act
like two maniacs in the sack
we fuck like two jackrabbits
and maybe that's a bad habit
'cause the next day we're right back at it
in the same exact pattern
what the fuck is the matter with us?
we can't figure out if it's lust or it's love
what's that that's attractin' us to each other?
they say that every man grows up to marry his own mother
which would explain why you're such a motherfuckin' bitch
but i stay and still stick it out with you
even though i just hit you today
but you deserve it, you hit me first and provoked me to choke you
just 'cause i came home late last night
crawled in bed and i woke you
but if there's one thing about you that i admire it's, baby
because you stay with me, maybe 'cause you're as crazy as i am
'cause when i look at you i can see an angel in your eyes
but if i look deeper inside i see your freakish little side
like a devil in disguise, you're always full of surprises
always pullin' devices out your purse: little vibrators and dildoes
you fucked yourself so much you barely feel those anymore
you're only 24, but you're plenty more ma-ture
than those other little hoes who just act like little girls
like they're in middle school still
you're crazy, sexy, cool, chill
and you play your position, you never step outta line
even though i stay in your business you've always kept outta mine
i wonder what's on your mind
sometimes they say, "love is blind"
maybe that's why the first time
i dotted your eye you ain't see the sign
or maybe you did, maybe you like being shoved
maybe 'cause we're crazy in love


you are the ink to my paper, what my pen is to my pad
the moral, the very fiber, the whole substance to my rap
you are my reason for being, the meaning of my existence
if it wasn't for you i would never be able to spit this
as intense as i do, and the irony is you rely on me
as much as i rely on you to inspire me like you do
you provide me the lighter fluid, the fuel to my fire
you're my entire supply: gas, the match, and igniter
the only way that i am able to stay so stable
is you're the legs to my table
if you were to break i'd fall on my face
but i'm always gonna make you feel i don't need you as much
as i really need you so you don't use it to your advantage
but you're essential to me, you're the air i breathe i believe
if you ever leave me i'd probably have no reason to be
you are the kim to my marshall, you're the slim to my shady
the dre to my eminem, the alaina to my hailie
you are the word that i'm lookin' for
when i'm tryin' to describe how i feel inside
and the right one just won't come to my mind
you're like the pillar that props me up, the beam that supports me
the bitch who never took half, the wife who never divorced me
you're like the root to my evil, you let my devil come out me
you let me beat the shit out you before you beat the shit out me
and no matter how much, too much is never enough
maybe 'cause we're crazy in love



sh-sh-sh, shady! aftermath! haha!
g-g-g-g, g-unit! haha!

'cause we came here to set this party off right
let’s bounce tonight
and if they don’t let us in through the front
we’ll come through the side
'cause i don’t ever wanna leave the game
without at least saying goodbye
so all my people on the left, all my people on the right
scream one last time


get your ass up for the doctor, one more time
get your ass up for the doctor, come on now
here we go, cliff hanger, it's another club banger
got you hangin' on the edge of your seat, get on down


time's up, game's over, you lose, i win
’bout to show these knuckleheads how to do this here
oh yeah, new year, next phase, begin
look who's got you goin' crazy again
i'm a trend, i set one every time i'm in
i go out, and just come back full circle again
you a fad, that means you something that we already had
but once you're gone, you don't come back (oh!)
too bad you're off the map now, radar can't even find you
we stay on the grind, you slip, we out-grind you
you walk around mad, you let your anger blind you
we walk around, just playin' the violin behind you
enough with all the pissin' and moanin', whining and bitchin'
sit and observe, listen, you'll learn if you pay attention
why ten multi-platinum albums later, three diamond
worldwide, we're on the charts with a bullet, and still climbin'


'cause we came here to set this party off right
let's bounce tonight
and if they don't let us in through the front
we'll come through the side
'cause i don't ever wanna leave the game
without at least saying goodbye
so all my people on the left, all my people on the right
scream one last time


when dr. dre says crunk, you will get it crunk
get it crunk! crunk! crunk! crunk!
and when 50 cent says jump, you get on one foot and
jump! jump! jump! jump! jump!


the buzz is tremendous, we drop you all to sense it
i don't gotta' promote it for you to know that doc is off the benches
we keep the party rockin' off the hinges
we ain't showin' off, we just going off popular consensus
but critics say that doc is soft, doc is talk
doc is all washed up, knock it off, who the fuck is doc impressin'?
doc is this, doc is that, you got the wrong impression
you must be on the cock of doc 'cause doc left you all guessin'
so dj take the needle and just drop it on the record (what?)
we gon' have this motherfucker hoppin' in a second (bump, bump)
that's why we always save the best cut last
to make you scratch and itch for it like fresh cut grass
'cause we done swam with the sharks, wrestled with alligators
spoke to a generation of angry teenagers
whom, if it wasn't for rap to bridge the gap, may be raised to be racist
who may have never got to see our faces
graced the cover of rolling stone pages
broke down barriers of language and races
just call on the caped crusaders and leave it to me and dre to
pass the mic and we can play the
back and forth all day like the hot potato game
that's why we came to


'cause we came here to set this party off right
let's bounce tonight
and if they don't let us in through the front
we'll come through the side
'cause i don't ever wanna leave the game
without at least saying goodbye
so all my people on the left, all my people on the right
scream one last time


bounce now, hands up, you know how we do
we make the club jump everywhere we go
it's no secret, everybody know
when dre's involved, there's plenty of money involved
and plenty honey's involved and sunny sundays and palm trees
cali, everyday is just another party
from the valleys all the way to them 8 mile alleys
let's rally, hands up for the grand finale
now raise up out your seat, dre's about to speak
blaze a pound of weed six days up out the week
you can catch me in the studio, bangin' out the beats to
provide you with the heat that keep blazin' out your speakers
so never say never 'cause shady, aftermath together
along with g-unit records, presents the return of the
the doc and shady, no one can do it better
we tear the club up and leave without a shred of evidence that, uh


we came here to set this party off right
let's bounce tonight
and if they don't let us in through the front
we'll come through the side
'cause i don't ever wanna leave the game
without at least saying goodbye
so all my people on the left, all my people on the right
scream one last time


yeah, haha! still aftermath, 2006!
and don't worry about that detox album, it's coming
we gon' make dre do it (haha!)
50 cent, g-unit, obie trice, d-twizzy, stat quo, dr. dre, we ain't leaving, let's go
haha! ladies and gentlemen, thank you all for coming out! peace!
oh shit! i almost forgot
you're coming with me!
hahaha! bye, bye!
see you in hell, fuckers!

lord, please forgive me for what i do
for i know not what i've done


father, please, forgive me for i know not what i do
i just never had the chance to ever meet you
therefore i did not know that i would grow to be
my mother's evil seed and do these evil deeds


momma had a baby and its head popped off
head popped off, head popped off, head popped off, head popped off, head popped off
but momma don't want me, the next thing i know, i'm gettin' dropped off
gettin' dropped off, gettin' dropped off, gettin' dropped off, gettin' dropped off
ring-ring-ring on the doorbell of the next door neighbors, on their front porch
their front porch, their front porch, their front porch, their front porch
but they didn't want me neither, so they left me on someone else's lawn
else's lawn, else's lawn, else's lawn
'til somebody finally took me in, my great aunt and uncle, edna and charles
edna and charles, edna and charles, edna and charles, edna and charles, they were the ones who were left in charge
my elementary, they'd gang up on me and sing this song
sing this song, sing this song, sing this song, sing this song
it went a little something like:
"mary had a little lamb, little lamb, little lamb
debbie had a satan spawn, satan spawn"
momma why do they keep sayin' this? i just don't understand, understand
and, by the way, where's my dad?


father, please, forgive me for i know not what i do
i just never had the chance to ever meet you
therefore i did not know that i would grow to be
my mother's evil seed and do these evil deeds


predominantly, predominantly, everything's always predominantly
predominantly white, predominantly black; well, what about me?
where does that leave me? well, i guess that i'm between predominantly both of 'em
i think if i hear that fuckin' word again, i'ma scream
while i'm projectile vomitin'; what do i look like, a comedian to you?
do you think that i'm kiddin'? what do i look like, some kinda idi-
wait a minute, shit, don't answer that; why am i so misunderstood?
why do i go through so much bullshit? it's such bullshit, it's tush mull bish
"what was me, there goes poor marshall, again whinin' about his millions
and his mansion, and his sorrow he's always drownin' in
and the dad that he never had, and how his childhood was so bad
and how his mom was a dope addict, and his ex-wife, how they go at it
man, i'd hate to have it as bad as that mr. mathers claims he had it
i can't imagine it: that little rich, poor, white bastard
needs to take some of that cash out of the bank and take a bath in it"
man, if i only had half of it
shit, if you only knew the half of it...
haha


father, please, forgive me for i know not what i do
i just never had the chance to ever meet you
therefore i did not know that i would grow to be
my mother's evil seed and do these evil deeds


evil deeds, while i plant these evil seeds
please, release me from these demons
i never had any of this shit planned, mom, please, believe
i don't wanna be satan's spawn
never got the chance to say "i'm sorry"
now look at all the pain i caused
dear santa claus, why are you not comin' this year again?
what did i do that was so bad to deserve this?
everything could have been so perfect
but life ain't a fairytale, i'm about to be hoisted up in the air
forty feet below me there's people everywhere
i don't even know, but who feel like they know me 'cause i'm in this ferris wheel
and all i wanna do is go to the mall and take hailie on the carousel
without this crowd everywhere i go, but life is like a merry-go-round
here we go now, do-si-do now, curtains up, the show must go now
ring-around-the-rosie, the show's over, you can all go home now
but the curtain just don't close for me, this ain't how fame was supposed to be
where's the switch i could just turn off-and-on? this ain't what i chose to be
so, please, god, give me the strength to have what it takes to carry on
'til i pass 50 back the baton, the camera's on, my soul is gone


father, please, forgive me for i know not what i do
i just never had the chance to ever meet you
therefore i did not know that i would grow to be
my mother's evil seed and do these evil deeds


i said, "father, please forgive me for i know not what i do
i just never had the chance to ever meet you
therefore i did not know that i would grow to be
my mother's evil seed and do these evil deeds"
(evil deeds, evil deeds, evil deeds)


*gunshot*
*crowd cheering*

armaggedon! let's go!


i got a riddle: what's little and talks big
with midget arms and creamy white fillin' in the middle
that will do anything to throw dirt on my name
if it means walkin' the whole mediterranean?
is it an albanian, armenian, iranian
tasmanian? no! it's dave, raymond and, oh
osorio, so sorry, woah
but that was a long time ago
when i was just joe shmoe rappin' in joe blows' basement
i apologized for it befo', so
either accept it or you don't, and let's move on
if i ain't shown that i've grown and get the bone
keep lickin' these nuts, you industry mutts
keep walkin' around sniffin' each others' butts
or should i say asses? what would be the more politically
correct term to use for the masses?


hold on, hold on, hold up, new york city, man
it's the kid, lloyd banks
and if you hearin' what i'm hearin' right now
you know this ain't no regular shit, homie
this somethin' special, and we gotta bring this back
green, come on
countdown to armaggedon! let's go!


i got a riddle: what's little and talks big
with midget arms and creamy white fillin' in the middle
that will do anything to throw dirt on my name
if it means walkin' the whole mediterranean?
is it an albanian, armenian, iranian
tasmanian? no! it's dave, raymond and, oh
osorio, so sorry, woah
but that was a long time ago
when i was just joe shmoe rappin' in joe blows' basement
i apologized for it befo', so
either accept it or you don't, and let's move on
if i ain't shown that i've grown and get the bone
keep lickin' these nuts, you industry mutts
keep walkin' around sniffin' each others' butts
or should i say asses? what would be the more politically
correct term to use for the masses?
the question i ask is: how can i explain this?
how can i swing this in english language
if i switch to slang and turn man to mayn
do i do it in vain or simply to entertain?
am i being real, or am i being fake?
am i just a fraud, or am i truly genuine?
or am i caught up in this hot water?
wody on my daughter, i told ya, i love this culture
don't let em' insult ya, i'ma tell ya one more 'gain
this is the environment that i was brought up in
but every now and then
i use my pen to get rid of some frustration
or should i say shun?
is it just another one of my subliminal ways of racism, huh?
your face is numb, you're stunned, your look is cold
like that of a man of seventy-some-years-old
and it only gets colder, which is why i understand
and can't be mad at a forty-four-year-old fan
with a chip on his shoulder, who only owns a half
of a magazine and the only way to have it seen
is to put me on the front of it again
only thing that makes him grin is to see me frown
papa can't stand me
papa needs to take his medication and sit the fuck down
in his new chair that goes round and round
that he bought from new money in his bank account
that i get him every issue when the thang comes out
sit back, and let his puffy clown hair come out
and let his black side arm wrestle his white side
yell "apartheid" loud enough that he might slide
he might find someone dumb enough who might ride
but ain't nobody over here buyin' two white guys
disguised as pro-black, there is no slack
for a harvard college grad in a fitted hat and a hunch back
standin' by the clearance coat rack
in some old slacks and some rso throwbacks, yeah


shady in the place to be, see
and it takes what i got to rock the mic, right!
still not gonna cater to these punks
fuckin' cocksuckin' pussy lips haters dicks cunts!

down, down, down
down, down, down
down, down, down
down, okay
guess who's back, back again
shady's back, tell a friend
now everyone report to the dance floor
to the dance floor, to the dance floor
now everyone report to the dance floor
alright, stop, pajama time


come here, little kiddies, on my lap
guess who's back with a brand new rap?
and i don't mean "rap" as in a new case
of child molestation accusations
ah-ah-ah-ah-ah, no worries
papa's got a brand new bag of toys
what else could i possibly do to make noise?
i done touched on everything but little boys
and that's not a stab at michael
that's just a metaphor, i'm just psycho
i go a little bit crazy sometimes
i get a little bit out of control with my rhymes
good god, dip, do a little slide
bend down, touch your toes, and just glide
up the center of the dance floor
like tp for my bung-hole
and it's cool if you let one go
nobody's gonna know, who'd hear it?
give a little poot-poot, it's okay
oops, my cd just skipped
and everyone just heard you let one rip


now i'm gonna make you dance
it's your chance, yeah, boy, shake that ass
whoops, i mean girl, girl, girl, girl
girl, you know you're my world
alright, now lose it (ah-ah-ah-ah-ah)
just lose it (ah-ah-ah-ah-ah)
go crazy (ah-ah-ah-ah-ah)
oh, baby (ah-ah), oh, baby, baby (ah-ah)


well, it's friday and it's my day
just to party all the way 'til sunday
maybe 'til monday, i don't know what day
every day's just a holiday
cruisin' on the freeway, feelin' kinda breezy
let the top down and my hair blow
i don't know where i'm goin', all i know is
when i get there someone's gonna touch my body


'scuse me, miss, i don't mean to sound like a jerk
but i'm feelin' just a little stressed out from work
could you punch me in the stomach and pull my hair?
spit on me? maybe gouge my eyes out? (yeah)
now, what's your name, girl? what's your sign?
man, you must be up out your mind
dre (ah-ah), beer goggles, blind
i'm just tryin' to unwind, now i'm


now i'm gonna make you dance
it's your chance, yeah, boy, shake that ass
whoops, i mean girl, girl, girl, girl
girl, you know you're my world
alright, now lose it (ah-ah-ah-ah-ah)
just lose it (ah-ah-ah-ah-ah)
go crazy (ah-ah-ah-ah-ah)
oh, baby (ah-ah), oh, baby, baby (ah-ah)


well, it's tuesday and i'm locked up
i'm in jail and i don't know what happened
they say i was runnin' butt-naked
down the street screamin' (ah-ah-ah-ah)
your honor, i'm sorry, i don't remember
all i know is this much, i'm not guilty
they said, "save it, boy, we got you on tape"
yellin' at an old lady to touch my body


now this is the part where the rap breaks down
it gets real intense, no one makes a sound
everything looks like it's 8 mile now
the beat comes back and everybody lose themselves
now snap back to reality look, it's b. rabbit
yo, you signed me up to battle? i'm a grown man
chubba-chubba-chubba-chubba-chubba-chubba-chubby
i don't have any lines to go right here, so chubba-teletubby
fellas (what?) fellas (what?)
grab your left nut, make your right one jealous (what?)
black girls, white girls, skinny girls, fat girls
tall girls, small girls, i'm calling all girls
everyone report to the dance floor
it's your chance for a little romance or
butt squeezin', it's the season
just go (ah-ah-ah-ah), so appeasin'


now i'm gonna make you dance
it's your chance, yeah, boy, shake that ass
whoops, i mean girl, girl, girl, girl
girl, you know you're my world
alright, now lose it (ah-ah-ah-ah-ah)
just lose it (ah-ah-ah-ah-ah)
go crazy (ah-ah-ah-ah-ah)
oh, baby (ah-ah), oh, baby, baby (ah-ah)


touch my body
touch my body
oh boy, just touch my body
i mean girl, just touch my body

step by step, heart to heart
left, right, left, we all fall down...


step by step, heart to heart
left, right, left, we all fall down
like toy soldiers
bit by bit, torn apart
we never win, but the battle wages on
for toy soldiers


i'm supposed to be the soldier who never blows his composure
even though i hold the weight of the whole world on my shoulders
i ain't never supposed to show it
my crew ain't supposed to know it
even if it means goin' toe-to-toe with a benzino
it don't matter, i never drag 'em in battles that i can't handle
'less i absolutely have to, i'm supposed to set an example
i need to be the leader, my crew looks for me to guide 'em
if some shit ever does pop off, i'm supposed to be beside 'em
that ja shit, i tried to squash it, it was too late to stop it
there's a certain line you just don't cross, and he crossed it
i heard him say hailie's name on a song and i just lost it
it was crazy, the shit went way beyond some jay-z and nas shit
and even though the battle was won, i feel like we lost it
i spent so much energy on it, honestly i'm exhausted
and i'm so caught in it, i almost feel i'm the one who caused it
this ain't what i'm in hip-hop for, it's not why i got in it
that was never my object, for someone to get killed
why would i wanna destroy somethin' i helped build?
it wasn't my intentions, my intentions were good
i went through my whole career without ever mentionin' ****
and that was just outta respect, for not runnin' my mouth
and talkin' about somethin' that i knew nothin' about
plus dre told me stay out, this just wasn't my beef
so i did, i just fell back, watched and gritted my teeth
while he's all over tv, down-talkin' the man
who literally saved my life, like fuck it, i understand
this is business, and this shit just isn't none of my business
but still knowin' the shit could pop off at any minute, 'cause


step by step, heart to heart
left, right, left, we all fall down
like toy soldiers
bit by bit, torn apart
we never win, but the battle wages on
for toy soldiers


there used to be a time when you could just say a rhyme and
wouldn't have to worry about one of your people dyin'
but now it's elevated, 'cause once you put someone's kids in it
the shit gets escalated—it ain't just words no more, is it?
it's a different ballgame, you call names and you ain't just rappin'
we actually tried to stop the 50 and ja beef from happenin'
me and dre had sat with him, kicked it and had a chat with him
and asked him not to start it, he wasn't gonna go after him
until ja started yappin' in magazines how he stabbed him
fuck it, 50, smash him! mash on him, let him have it
meanwhile my attention's pulled in another direction
some receptionist at the source who answers phones at his desk
has an erection for me and thinks that i'll be his resurrection
tries to blow the dust off his mic and make a new record
but now he's fucked the game up 'cause one of the ways i came up
was through that publication, the same one that made me famous
now the owner of it has got a grudge against me for nothin'?
well, fuck it, that motherfucker could get it too, fuck him then!
but i'm so busy bein' pissed off, i don't stop to think
that we've just inherited 50's beef with murder inc.
and he's inherited mine, which is fine, ain't like either of us mind
we still have soldiers that's on the front line
who's willin' to die for us as soon as we give the orders
never to extort us, strictly to show they support us
and maybe shout 'em out in a rap or up in a chorus
to show 'em we love 'em back and let 'em know how important
it is to have runyon avenue soldiers up in our corners
their loyalty to us is worth more than any award is
but i ain't tryna have none of my people hurt or murdered
it ain't worth it, i can't think of a perfecter way to word it
than to just say that i love y'all too much to see the verdict
i'll walk away from it all 'fore i let it go any further
but don't get it twisted, it's not a plea that i'm coppin'
i'm just willin' to be the bigger man, if y'all can quit poppin'
off at the jaws, well, then i can, 'cause frankly i'm sick of talkin'
i'm not gonna let someone else's coffin rest on my conscience
'cause


step by step, heart to heart
left, right, left, we all fall down
like toy soldiers
bit by bit, torn apart
we never win, but the battle wages on
for toy soldiers

still love me? take this
you ready? one, two, three!


the more you put me through
the more it makes me wanna come back to you
you say you hate me, i just love you more
you don't want me, i just want you more
i buy you flowers, you throw 'em at me
i know it's sad but it's makin' me happy
the more that you slap me, the more that it turns me on
'cause you love me and i love you more


it's sick, but who could ever predict we'd be doin' the same shit?
we say “we do it for our baby”, but we don't
we do it for us, it's lust 'cause neither one
of us trust each other, so we fuck, 'til we bust
and we cuss each other out, we know what it's about, shout
'til i throw you out the house, you throw me out the house
i throw you on the couch, punch you in the mouth
fist fight 'til we turn this mother out
then apologize after, laughter, pain
it's insane, we're back in the same chapter again
and it's sad, but it's true: when i'm layin' here with you
there ain't nothin' anyone could ever say or ever do, 'cause—


the more you put me through
the more it makes me wanna come back to you
you say you hate me, i just love you more
you don't want me, i just want you more
i buy you flowers, you throw 'em at me
i know it's sad, but it's makin' me happy
the more that you slap me, the more that it turns me on
'cause you love me and i love you more


'cause i hate you, do you hate me?
good, 'cause you're so fuckin' beautiful when you're angry
it makes me wanna just take you and just throw you
on the bed, and fuck you like i don't even know you
you fuck other people and i fuck other people
you're a slut, but i'm equal, i'm a mutt, we're both evil
in our ways, but neither one of us would ever admit it
'cause one of us would have one up on the other, so forget it
we can make accusations, people spread rumors
but they ain't got proof, 'til they do it's just the two of us
it's you and me, 'cause any chick can say that she's screwin' me
but you gotta believe me to a degree 'cause true indeed
if you didn't, i wouldn't be hittin' — yeah, i would
'cause the sex is too damn good, if i ran who would i run to
that would be this soft and warm?
so it's off and on, usually more off than on
but at least we know that we share this common bond
you're the only one i can fuck without a condom on
i hope the only reason that i cope is 'cause of that fact
and plus, i can bust in that, and that's why—


the more you put me through
the more it makes me wanna come back to you
you say you hate me, i just love you more
you don't want me, i just want you more
i buy you flowers, you throw 'em at me
i know it's sad but it's makin' me happy
the more that you slap me, the more that it turns me on
'cause you love me and i love you more


i can never understand it, that's why i don't try
from junior high until we both die, it's silly
oh, why must we try? is it really so rough
that we must always call each other's billy goat's gruff?
try to pull each other's legs until the other begs
we're lyin' to ourselves, that's the beauty of it, yeah
'cause we truly love each other, that's why we always fightin'
all we do is shove each other every other fuckin' night
and it's clear it ain't gonna change, it's pent-up rage
we both have, we both feel like we've been upstaged
by someone else, we've both been someone else's
“someone else,” problem is neither one wants help
it's an addiction and it can't be fixed
our family's mixed up, there's a baby sister in the mix
and it hurts 'cause the pieces to the puzzle don't fit
and anybody who thinks they know us doesn't know shit
and they're probably just tired of hearin' it all the time
on every song, every lyric in every rhyme
all the hoopla, all of the whoopty-woo
what you put me through, fuckin' whoopty-do
but i won't be made a fool of, if this is true love
you wouldn't do what you did last time, you wouldn't screw up
this time, 'cause this time, girl, i'm tellin' you what
you do it again, i'm fuckin' you up


no matter what you say, what you do
i'mma hunt you down, 'til i find you
no matter where you run, i'll be right the-re
right behind you in your nightma-res
so, i brought you the flowers and the candy
all the times that you threw it back at me
told me you hate me, you gon' hate me more
when you find out you can't escape me, whore


the more you put me through
the more it makes me wanna come back to you
you say you hate me, i just love you more
you don't want me, i just want you more
i buy you flowers, you throw 'em at me
i know it's sad but it's makin' me happy
the more that you slap me, the more that it turns me on
'cause you love me, and i love you more

yeah
i know sometimes
things may not always make sense to you right now
but hey
what daddy always tell you?
straighten up, little soldier
stiffen up that upper lip
what you cryin' about?
you got me


hailie, i know you miss your mom, and i know you miss your dad
when i'm gone, but i'm tryin' to give you the life that i never had
i can see you're sad, even when you smile, even when you laugh
i can see it in your eyes, deep inside you wanna cry
'cause you're scared, i ain't there, daddy's wit' you in your prayers
no more cryin', wipe them tears, daddy's here, no more nightmares
we gon' pull together through it, we gon' do it
lainie, uncle's crazy, ain't he? yeah, but he loves you, girl, and you better know it
we're all we got in this world when it spins, when it swirls
when it whirls, when it twirls, two little beautiful girls
lookin' puzzled, in a daze, i know it's confusin' you
daddy's always on the move, mama's always on the news
i try to keep you sheltered from it, but somehow it seems
the harder that i try to do that, the more it backfires on me
all the things growin' up as daddy that he had to see
daddy don't want you to see, but you see just as much as he did
we did not plan it to be this way, your mother and me
but things have got so bad between us, i don't see us ever bein'
together ever again, like we used to be when we was teenagers
but then, of course, everything always happens for a reason
i guess it was never meant to be
but it's just somethin' we have no control over, and that's what destiny is
but no more worries, rest your head and go to sleep
maybe one day we'll wake up and this'll all just be a dream


now hush, little baby, don't you cry
everything's gonna be alright
stiffen that upper lip up, little lady, i told ya
daddy's here to hold ya through the night
i know mommy's not here right now and we don't know why
we feel how we feel inside
it may seem a little crazy, pretty baby
but i promise mama's gon' be alright


heh, it's funny
i remember back one year when daddy had no money
mommy wrapped the christmas presents up and stuck 'em under the tree
and said some of 'em were from me 'cause daddy couldn't buy 'em
i'll never forget that christmas, i sat up the whole night crying
'cause daddy felt like a bum—see, daddy had a job
but his job was to keep the food on the table for you and mom
and at the time, every house that we lived in
either kept gettin' broken into and robbed or shot up on the block
and your mom was savin' money for you in a jar
tryin' to start a piggy bank for you so you could go to college
almost had a thousand dollars 'til someone broke in and stole it
and i know it hurt so bad it broke your mama's heart
and it seemed like everything was just startin' to fall apart
mom and dad was arguin' a lot
so mama moved back on to chalmers in the flat, one-bedroom apartment
and dad moved back to the other side of 8 mile on novara
and that's when daddy went to california with his cd
and met dr. dre, and flew you and mama out to see me
but daddy had to work, you and mama had to leave me
then you started seein' daddy on the tv
and mama didn't like it
and you and lainie were too young to understand it
papa was a rolling stone, mama developed a habit
and it all happened too fast for either one of us to grab it
i'm just sorry you were there and had to witness it firsthand
'cause all i ever wanted to do was just make you proud
now i'm sittin' in this empty house just reminiscin'
lookin' at your baby pictures, it just trips me out
to see how much you both have grown, it's almost like you're sisters now
wow, guess you pretty much are, and daddy's still here
lainie, i'm talkin' to you too, daddy's still here
i like the sound of that, yeah, it's got a ring to it, don't it?
shh! mama's only gone for the moment


now hush, little baby, don't you cry
everything's gonna be alright
stiffen that upper lip up, little lady, i told ya
daddy's here to hold ya through the night
i know mommy's not here right now and we don't know why
we feel how we feel inside
it may seem a little crazy, pretty baby
but i promise mama's gon' be alright


and if you ask me to, daddy's gonna buy you a mockingbird
i'ma give you the world
i'ma buy a diamond ring for you, i'ma sing for you
i'll do anything for you to see you smile
and if that mockingbird don't sing and that ring don't shine
i'ma break that birdie's neck
i'll go back to the jeweler who sold it to ya
and make him eat every carat, don't fuck with dad! (haha)

i pledge allegiance to the flag
of the united states of america
and to the republic for which it stands (people)
one nation, under god, indivisible
with liberty and justice for all (it feels so good to be back)
(mosh with me now)


scrutinize every word, memorize every line
i spit it once, refuel, re-energize, and rewind
i give sight to the blind, my insight through the mind
i exercise my right to express when i feel it's time
it's just all in your mind, what you interpret it as
i say to fight, you take it as "i'ma whip someone's ass"
and if you don't understand, don't even bother to ask
a father who has grown up with a fatherless past
who has blown up now to rap phenomenon that has
or at least shows no difficulty multitaskin'
and juggling both, perhaps mastered his craft slash
entrepreneur who's helped launch a few more rap acts
who's had a few obstacles thrown his way through the last half
of his career, typical manure, movin' past that
mr. kiss-his-ass-crack, he's a class act
rubber band man, yeah, he just snaps back


come along, follow me as i lead through the darkness
as i provide just enough spark that we need
to proceed, carry on, give me hope
give me strength, come with me and i won't steer you wrong
put your faith and your trust as i guide us through the fog
to the light at the end of the tunnel, we gon' fight, we gon' charge
we gon' stomp, we gon' march through the swamp
we gon' mosh through the marsh, take us right through the doors, come on


all the people up top, on the side and the middle
come together, let's all form and swarm just a little
just let it gradually build from the front to the back
all you can see is a sea of people, some white and some black
don't matter what color, all that matters we're gathered together
to celebrate for the same cause no matter the weather
if it rains, let it rain, yeah, the wetter, the better
they ain't gon' stop us, they can't, we're stronger now more than ever
they tell us no, we say yeah, they tell us stop, we say go
rebel with a rebel yell, raise hell, we gon' let 'em know
stomp, push, shove, mush, fuck bush
until they bring our troops home, come on, just


come along, follow me as i lead through the darkness
as i provide just enough spark that we need
to proceed, carry on, give me hope
give me strength, come with me and i won't steer you wrong
put your faith and your trust as i guide us through the fog
to the light at the end of the tunnel, we gon' fight, we gon' charge
we gon' stomp, we gon' march through the swamp
we gon' mosh through the marsh, take us right through the doors, come on


imagine it pourin', just rainin' down on us
moshpits outside the oval office
someone's tryna tell us somethin', maybe this is god just
sayin' we're responsible for this monster, this coward
that we have empowered, this is bin laden
look at his head noddin'
how could we allow somethin' like this without pumpin' our fists?
now this is our final hour
let me be the voice and your strength and your choice
let me simplify the rhyme just to amplify the noise
try to amplify it, times it, and multiply it by six
'teen million people all equal at this high pitch
maybe we can reach al-qaeda through my speech
let the president answer a higher anarchy
strap him with an ak-47, let him go
fight his own war, let him impress daddy that way
no more blood for oil
we got our own battles to fight on our own soil
no more psychological warfare
to trick us to thinkin' that we ain't loyal
if we don't serve our own country, we're patronizin' a hero
look in his eyes, it's all lies
the stars and stripes have been swiped, washed out, and wiped
and replaced with his own face, mosh now or die
if i get sniped tonight, you'll know why
'cause i told you to fight


so come along, follow me as i lead through the darkness
as i provide just enough spark that we need
to proceed, carry on, give me hope
give me strength, come with me and i won't steer you wrong
put your faith and your trust as i guide us through the fog
to the light at the end of the tunnel, we gon' fight, we gon' charge
we gon' stomp, we gon' march through the swamp
we gon' mosh through the marsh, take us right through the doors, come on

and as we proceed
to mosh through this desert storm
and these closing statements
if they should argue, let us beg to differ
as we set aside our differences
and assemble our own army
to disarm this weapon of mass destruction
that we call our president for the present
and mosh for the future of our next generation
to speak and be heard
mr. president, mr. senator
can you guys hear us?

oh! yeah! so much for first single on this one


shady's the label, aftermath is the stable
that the horses come out of—erra
of course we're about to stir up
some shit thick as mrs. buttersworth's syrup
it's the mr. picked-on-christopher-reeves-just-for-no-reason
other than to—just to tease him
'cause he was his biggest (*burp*) fan
he used to be superman, now i'm pourin'
liquor on the curb in his name for him
"eminem, you wait 'til we meet up again, fucker

and woke up in bed next to his best friend derrick, bare-naked
jig-a-jig-ji-ji-janean just turned 16 and used a fake id
to sneak in v.i.p. to see r. kelly
hee-hee-hee-hee-hee-hee to be so young and naïve
oh what i wouldn't give to live so kim and carefree
paris and nicky's parents must be so tickled, they cherish
every picture with their kids with hickeys all over their necks
hickory-dickory dirk diggler, look at me work wizardry
with these words – am i a jerk or just jerk chicken?
or chiga-chigga-chig-chig-jer-chig-jer jerkin' your chain
twenty-two jerks in a jerk circle, or is it a circle jerk?
wait a minute, what am i sayin'? allow me to run it back
and rewind it {blblblblblblblb} – wait, let me ask you again
am i just jerkin' your chain? am i berserk or insane?
or am i just one of them damn amateurs workin' the dang
cameras, filmin' one of them paris hilton homemade
pornos, who keeps tiltin' the lens at an angle
jigga-ji-just recently somebody just discovered
britney and justin videotapes of 'em fuckin'
when they was just mouseketeers in the mickey mouse club
and dusted 'em and went straight to the source with 'em
'cause they could've sworn someone said, "ni—"
and then tried to erase and record over it
but if you listen close enough to it you can hear the
"ga-hu" and then they come to
find out it was justin sayin', "i'm gon—nuh cum!"

one shot, two shot, three shots, four shots
all i hear is gunshots, this is where the fun stops
bodies drop, hit the floor, music's off, party stops
everybody hit the door, somebody's licking shots off


(kuniva, you alright?) these niggas is tripping (where's bizarre at?) (i don't know, man)
i'm trying to slip through the exit and get to where my car is at
bitches screaming everywhere, and niggas is wylin'
two minutes ago, we was all joking and smiling
this chick is clinging on to me, sobbing, and sighing
saying she didn't mean to diss me earlier, and she crying
but it's real and it's on and caps is getting peeled
so i hugged her and used her body as a human shield, and
she got hit, and now she's yelling (don't leave me!)
i told her i'd be right back, and the dumb bitch believed me!
i squeezed through the back door and made my escape
i ran and got my .38, i hope it's not too late!


one shot, two shot, three shots, four shots
all i hear is gunshots, this is where the fun stops
bodies drop, hit the floor, music's off, party stops
everybody hit the door, somebody's licking shots off


one shot, two shot, three shots, four shots
all i hear is gunshots, this is where the fun stops
bodies drop, hit the floor, music's off, party stops
everybody hit the door, somebody's licking shots off


i never seen no shit like this in my life before
people are still camped out from the night before
sleeping outside the door, waiting in line still
trying to get inside the club to see d12 perform
the fire marshals know the venue's too small
people are wall to wall, three-thousand and some odd
fans and some cum-wad from out the parking lot
gets in an argument over a parking spot
decides to pull his gun out and lets a few of them off
missed who he's aiming for, six feet away’s the door
into st. andrew's hall, now the strays flying all over the place
grazed one bitch in the face
another one of 'em came through the wall
before anyone could even hear the first shot go off
i'm posted up at the bar, having a mazel tov
bullet whizzed right by my ear, damn near shot it off
thank, god, i'm alive, i gotta find denaun
and where the fuck is von? he usually tucks one on him
wait a minute, i think i just saw bizarre
nah, i guess not, what the fuck? oh, my god, it was!
i never saw him run so fast in my life
look at him hauling ass, i think he left his wife
there she is, on the ground, being trampled
i go to grab her up by the damn hand, but i can't pull her
god damn, there just went another damn bullet
i'm hit, my vest is barely able to handle it
it's too thin, if i get hit again, i can't do it
i scoop dee, follow bizarre's path, ran through it and
made it to the front door and collapsed
on the steps, looked up, and i seen swift shooting it out
but i can't see who he's shooting it out with
but denaun's right behind him, squeezing his four-fifth


one shot, two shot, three shots, four shots
all i hear is gunshots, this is where the fun stops
bodies drop, hit the floor, music's off, party stops
everybody hit the door, somebody's licking shots off


one shot, two shot, three shots, four shots
all i hear is gunshots, this is where the fun stops
bodies drop, hit the floor, music's off, party stops
everybody hit the door, somebody's licking shots off

yeah
definitely, definitely
definitely dope
definitely
definitely k-mart
yeah
yeah (*fart*)


you find me offensive, i find you offensive
for finding me offensive, hence, if
i should draw the line any fences, if so, to what extents, if
any, should i go? 'cause it's getting expensive
being on the other side of the courtroom on the defensive
they say i cause extensive psychological nerve damage to the brain
when i go to lengths this far at other people's expenses
i say you're all just too goddamn sensitive
it's censorship, and it's downright blasphemous
let's end this shit now, 'cause i won't stand for this
and christopher reeves won't sit for this neither
and let's clear this up too, i ain't got no beef with him either
he used to be like a hero to me, i even believe i
had one of those 25-cent stickers on my refri-gerator
right next to darth vader
and darth must've put a hex on him for later
i feel like it's my fault, 'cause of the way that
i stuck him up in between him and lex luthor
i killed superman, i killed super—
man, and how ironic
that i'd be the bad guy, kryptonite, the green chronic


'cause i ain't got no legs
or no brain
nice to meet you
hi, my name is
i forgot my name
my aim was not to become what i became with this level of fame
my soul is possessed by this devil
my new name is... rain man

now in the bible, it says:
"thou shalt not watch two lesbians in bed
have homosexual sex
unless, of course, you were given the consent to join in
then, of course, it's intercourse, and it's bisexual sex
which isn't as bad
'long as you show some remorse for your actions
either before, during, or after
performing the act of that which
is normally referred to as such more commonly known phrases
that are more used by today's kids in a more derogatory way
but who's to say what's fair to say and what not to say?"
let's ask dr. dre—dr. dre? (what up?)
i got a question, if i may (yeah)
is it gay to play putt-putt golf with a friend? (yeah)
and watch his butt-butt when he tees off? (yeah)
but up, i ain't done yet
in football, the quarterback yells out, "hut-hut"
while he reaches in another grown man's ass
grabs on his nuts, but, just, what if
it was never meant—it was just an accident
but he tripped, fell, slipped, and his penis went in—
his teeny-tiny, little, round heinie, and he didn't mean it
but his little weenie flinched just a little bit
and i don't need to go into any more details, but
what if he pictured it as a female's butt?
is that gay? i just need to clear things up
'til then, i'll just walk around with a manly strut, because


'cause i ain't got no legs
or no brain
nice to meet you
hi, my name is
i forgot my name
my aim was not to become what i became with this level of fame
my soul is possessed by this devil
my new name is... rain man

you find me offensive, i find you offensive—
shit, this is the same verse, i just did this
when am i gonna come to my good senses?
probably the day bush comes to my defenses
my spider sense is telling me spider-man is nearby
and my plan is to get him next and
open up a whoop-ass canister
god damn it, dre, where's the goddamn beat? (yeah)
anyway, anyway, i don't know how else to put it
this is the only thing that i'm good at
i am the bad guy, kryptonite, the green chronic
demonic—yup, yup, don't worry, i'm on it
i got it, high-five nick lachey
stuck a pin in jessica's head and walked away (*pfffffff*)
and as she flew around the room like a balloon, i
grabbed the last can of chicken tuna out the trash can, and zoom, i
headed straight back to the neverland ranch
with a peanut butter-jelly-chicken-tuna sandwich
and i ain't even gotta make no goddamn sense
i just did a whole song, and i didn't say shit


'cause i ain't got no legs
or no brain
nice to meet you
hi, my name is
i forgot my name
my aim was not to become what i became
with this level of fame
my soul is possessed by this devil
my new name is... rain man

'cause ah, uh, ah, eh, ugh...
yup, rain man
definitely, definitely dr. dre
super-dope beatmaker
2000 and, 2000 and
four-hundred-and-eighty-seven-million-nine-hundred-and-se-
-seventy-three-thousand-four-hundred-and-sixty-three...
and seventy
yeah

there's an intruder
in my house
he cut my phone line (911, emer-)
can't dial out (shit!)
i scream for police
but i doubt
they're gonna hear me (*gun cock*)
when i shout
*gunshot*


a couple of cocktails'll send me to jail
there's a couple of cops hot on my trail, but this time
when i get pulled over there's a doberman pinscher
and a pit bull in the seat, these pigs'll get bit foolin' with me
quit foolin' with me, bitch, you're gonna see
no pistol in the seat, why it always
gotta be an issue when you're me in which you're gonna see
in the long run, i'ma be the wrong one
you wanna harass with this limo-tinted glass
flashin' that flashlight on my ass — where was you at
last night when them assholes ran up on my grass?
rapper slash actor, kiss the crack of my cracker slash ass
they took away my right to bear arms
what i'm 'posed to fight with, bare palms?
yeah, right! they comin' with bombs, i'm comin' with flare guns


we as americans, we as americans
us as a citizen gotta protect ourselves
look at how shit has been, we better check ourselves
livin' up in these streets through worse and through better health
survivin' by any means, we as americans
us as a citizen, we are samaritans
what do we get us in? we better check ourselves
look at how shit has been, take a look where you live
this is america, and we are americans


i make beaucoup bucks, wearin' beaucoup vests
drama hangin' over my head like a voodoo hex
i coulda been next to fly over the cuckoo's nest
with you-know-who, with an s tattooed to my chest
but i've finessed it, now i got the industry pissy
ever since me and dre split it fifty-fifty on 50
it's funny, we got a buzz spreadin' quicker
than makin' paper airplanes out of a twenty
fuck money! i don't rap for dead presidents
i'd rather see the president *daed*
it's never been said, but i set precedents
in the standards and they can't stand it
my name shoulda been "bastard," the shit shoulda been plastered
on my forehead with a stamp, i shoulda been blasted
i shoulda been had a cap put in my ass
but i'm too swift and fast for that, i'm past it
i'm too old to go and cruise gratiot — fuck that shit!
i done seen how fast this rap shit
can turn into some pap-pap shit, that quick, snap click
but this time, they got the fuckin' automatic
ain't no one gon' test this man — clack, click (*gunshot*)


we as americans, us as a citizen
gotta protect ourselves, look at how shit has been
we better check ourselves, livin' up in these streets
through worse and through better health, survivin' by any means
we as americans, us as a citizen
we are samaritans, what do we get us in?
we better check ourselves, look at how shit has been
take a look where you live, this is america, and we are americans


(shht!) i got a secret if you can keep it between us
i tuck two ninas under my jeans, either side of my penis
under my long johns, under my sean johns
one run-in with the long arm of the law, i'm long gone
i'ma do five years — no less than that, no questions asked
so it might be a good idea that i stop right here
and quit while i'm ahead, already in the red
already got a steady infrared meant for my head
a target on my back, bigger problems than that
bin laden on my ass, he probably gon' send a task
i ain't gon' even ask, they ain't gon' let me pack
they ain't gon' give me my semi, but i got my weed back


we as americans, us as a citizen
gotta protect ourselves, look at how shit has been
we better check ourselves, livin' up in these streets
through worse and through better health, survivin' by any means
we as americans, us as a citizen
we are samaritans, what do we get us in?
we better check ourselves, look at how shit has been
take a look where you live, this is america, and we are americans

what we have to do is deal with it when these individuals are young enough, if you will, to be saved, not in a religious sense, but not to constitute what this country at times calls (yeah) their throwaway children
we seem to be approaching (c'mon!) an age of the gross (*burp*)
we all have this idea that we should move up a little bit from our parents' station and each—and each generation should do a little bit better


all right, come on, let's cut the bullshit, enough
let's get it started, let's start addressin' this issue, and open it up
let's take this shit back to the basement and we can discuss
statements that's made on this tape and its whole origin of
the music that we all know and love, the music we all enjoy
the music you accuse me of tryin' to destroy
let's rewind it to '89 when i was a boy
on the east side of detroit, crossin' 8 mile into warren
into hick territory; i'd like to share a story
this is my story, and can't nobody tell it for me
you have well informed me, i am well-aware
that i don't belong here: you've made that perfectly clear
i get my ass kicked damn near everywhere
from bel-aire shopping center just for stoppin' in there
from the black side all the way to the white side
okay, there's a bright side, a day that i might slide
you may call it a pass, i call it haulin' my ass
through that patch of grass over them railroad tracks
oh, them railroad tracks, them old railroad tracks
them good old notorious so well known tracks


so, let's go back, follow the yellow brick road
as we go on another episode
journey with me as i take you through this nifty little place
that i once used to call home sweet home
come on, let's go back, follow the yellow brick road
as we go on another episode
journey with me as i take you through this nifty little place
that i once used to call home sweet home


i'd roam the streets so much they called me a drifter
sometimes i'd stick up a thumb just to hitchhike
just to get picked up to get me a lift to
8 mile and van dyke or steal a goddamn bike
from somebody's backyard, and drop it off at the park
that was the halfway mark, to meet kim had to walk
back to her mama's on chalmers after dark
to sneak me in the house when i'm kicked out my mom's
that's about the time i first met proof
with goofy gary on the steps at osborn, handin' out some flyers
we was doin' some talent shows at center line high
i told him to stop by and check us out sometime
he looked at me like i'm out my mind
shook his head like, "white boys don't know how to rhyme."
i spit out a line and rhymed "birthday" with "first place"
and we both had the same rhymes that sound alike
we was on the same shit, that big daddy kane shit
where compound syllables sound combined
from that day we was down to ride
somehow we knew we'd meet again somewhere down the line


so, let's go back, follow the yellow brick road
as we go on another episode

that i once used to call home sweet home

my first year in 9th grade, can't forget that day at school
it was cool 'til your man mc shan came through
he said that puma's the brand ‘cause the klan makes troops
it was rumors, but man, goddamn, they flew
musta been true, because man, we done banned they shoes
i had the new ones, the cool j ice lamb, suede too
but we just threw 'em in the trash like they yesterday's news
guess who came through next? x clan debuted
professor x (vanglorious!)
"exist in a state of red, black and green, with a key, sissies!"
now with this bein' the new trend, we don't fit in
crackas is out with cactus albums, blackness is in
african symbols and medallions represent black power
and we ain't know what it meant, me and my man howard
and butter would go to the mall
with 'em all over our necks like we're showin' 'em off
not knowin' at all we was bein' laughed at
"you ain't even half black!
you ain't 'posed to have that, homie, let me grab that!
and that flavor flav clock, we gon' have to snatch that!"
all i remember is meetin' back at
manix's basement, sayin' how we hate this
how racist but dope the x clan's tape is
which reminds me, back in '89, me
and kim broke up for the first time; she was tryin' to two-time me
and there was this black girl at our school, who thought i was cool
‘cause i rapped, so she was kinda eyein' me
and oh the irony, guess what her name was?
ain't even gonna say it, plus
the same color hair as hers was and blue contacts
and a pair of jugs, the bombest goddamn girl in our whole school
if i could pull her, not only would i become more popular
but i would be able to piss kim off at the same time
but it backfired
i was supposed to dump her but she dumped me for this black guy
and that's the last i ever seen or heard
or spoke to the "ole foolish pride" girl, but i've heard
people say they heard the tape and it ain't that bad
but it was: i singled out a whole race
and for that i apologize, i was wrong
‘cause no matter what color a girl is, she's still a—
