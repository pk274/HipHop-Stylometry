i got a couple of mansions
still, i don't have any manners
you got a couple of ghostwriters
but to these kids, it don't actually matter
they're askin' me, "what the fuck happened to hip-hop?"
i said, "i don't have any answers"
'cause i took an l when i dropped my last album
it hurt me like hell, but i'm back on these rappers (yeah)
and actually comin' from humble beginnings
i'm somewhat uncomfortable winning
i wish i could say, "what a wonderful feeling!
we're on the upswing like we're punchin' the ceiling!"
but nothin' is feeling like anyone has any fuckin' ability
to even stick to a subject, it's killin' me
the inability to pen humility
ha-ta-ta, ba-ta-ta, why don't we make a bunch of
fuckin' songs about nothin' and mumble 'em?
fuck it, i'm goin' for the jugular
shit is a circus, you clowns that are comin' up
don't give an ounce of a motherfuck
about the ones that were here before you that made rap (yeah)
let's recap, way back, mc's that (what?)
wreak havoc on tape decks (woo)
adat's, where the g raps and kanes at?
we need 3 stacks asap and bring masta ace back
'cause half of these rappers have brain damage
all the lean rappin', face tats, syruped out like tree sap
i don't hate trap (nah), and i don't wanna seem mad
but in fact (yeah), where the old me at? the same cat
that would take that feedback and aim back, i need that
but i think it's inevitable they know what button to press
or what lever to pull to give me to snap though (lil' bitch)
and if i pay it attention, i'm prob'ly makin' it bigger
but you've been takin' ya dicks and i'm fuckin' back, ho (get it?)
on the brink, any minute got me thinkin' of finishin'
everything with acetaminophen and reapin' the benefits
i'm asleep at the wheel again, as i begin to thinkin' about an evil intent of another beat i'ma kill again
'cause even if i gotta end up eating a pill again
even ketamine or methamphetamine with the minithin
it better be at least seventy or three-hundred milligram
and i might as well 'cause i'ma end up bein' a villain again
levels to this shit, i got an elevator
you could never say to me i'm not a fuckin' record breaker (yeah)
i sound like a broken record every time i break a record
nobody could ever take away the legacy i made, i never cater
motherfucker, now i got a right to be this way
i got spite inside my dna (yeah)
but i roll 'til the wheels fall off, i'm working tirelessly, ayy
it's the moment y'all been waitin' for like california
wishin' rain to pour in that drought, y'all
been prayin' for my downfall (yeah)
from the 8 mile to the southpaw
still the same marshall, that outlaw
that they say as a writer might've fell off
i'm back on that bull like the cowboys


so y'all gotta move, yeah, y'all gotta move, yeah, y'all gotta move
give me some room (woo!), give me some room (hey!), give me the juice
hop out the coupe (joyner!), hop out the coupe (joyner!), hop out and shoot
y'all gotta move (boom, bap), y'all gotta move (woo!), give me the juice
