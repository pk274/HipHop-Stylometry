my music is soothin' but it's also been proven
that it can put you in the mood to jump outta your car while it's movin'
you been waitin' on this moment, my sermon is like a omen
i'm servin', i'm erick sermon, i saw the window was open
and i jumped through it
my shit if you don't get pumped to it, i quit
here's my rhyme book, go 'head and thumb through it
and pick what you want from it
rummage and find somethin', you can use to jump someone and roll up bumpin'
i'm constantly coppin' over you, squattin'
shit has gotten to the point where i ain't even writin' no more, i'm just jottin'
this is chicken scratch
shit is sickenin', i been kickin' ass off bullshit throwaway rhymes
pick a batch
i live for the love of rap, you crazy
i've made beats for jay-z for free, page me
you need a beat
you canibus? then it's dre's fee
you kay slay? the fee's waived
i stay beefin' with j.d. 'till the day dre 2-ways me that it's okay to stop blazin' him
oops! i put it out
i apologize now, it's too late, g
it's on tape and the tape leaked
say what you say, motherfucker
