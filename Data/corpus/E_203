things just ain't the same for psychos
guns and rifles, sharp knives, i like those
i might just o.d. by the end of tonight's show
with the right dose, i might wipe out this light pole
but, the strangest things can happen from jabbin'
pregnant women in the abdomen till they can't have children
bitches get slapped up and drastic ass kicks
gay-bashin' fags with tire irons and ratchets
i've seen 'em come, i've watched 'em go
versace, "whoa, hey!" liberace, "ho!"
i mighta bashed somebody you probably know
buncha' faggots in your clique screamin', "it's not me! no!"
drug 'em out the closet and across the floor
went and paid 'em a visit in the hospital
stab 'em in the fuckin' tonsils with a popsicle stick
and sit back and watch 'em choke


'cause every chair that i throw (throw)
people sue me for dough
they press charges on me (me)
'til i canâ€™t fight anymo' (mo')
but every girl that i choke
i got lawyers, i know (know)
who got judges they know
so i suggest you stay home

what, what, what, what, what, what

album may 23rd
