it's like this and like that and like this
i'm the illest rapper to hold the cordless, patrollin' corners
lookin' for hookers to punch in the mouth with a roll of quarters
i'm meaner in action than roscoe beatin' james todd senior
and smackin' his back with vacuum cleaner attachments
i grew up in a wild hood, as a hazardous youth
with a fucked up childhood that i used as an excuse
and ain't shit changed, i kept the same mind state
since the third time that i failed ninth grade
you probably think that i'm a negative person
don't be so sure of it
i don't promote violence, i just encourage it
i laugh at the sight of death
as i fall down a cement flight of steps
and land inside a bed of spider webs
so throw caution to the wind
you and a friend can jump off of a bridge
and if you live, do it again
shit, why not? blow your brain out, i'm blowin' mine out
fuck it, you only live once, you might as well die now


met a retarded kid name greg with a wooden leg
snatched it off and beat him over the fucking head with the peg
go to bed with the keg, wake up with a 40
mix it with alka seltzer and formula 44-d
fuck an acid tab, i strapped the whole sheet to my forehead
waited 'til it absorbed in and fell to the floor dead
no more said, case closed, end of discussion
i'm blowin' up like spontaneous human combustion
leavin' you in the aftermath of holocaust and traumas
cross the bombers, we blowin' up your house
killin' your parents, and comin' back to get your foster mommas
and i'm as good at keepin' a promise as nostradamus
'cause i ain't makin' no more threats
i'm doin' drive-bys in tinted corvettes on vietnam war vets
i'm more or less sick in the head, maybe more
'cause i smoked crack today, yesterday, and the day before
saboteur, walk the block with a labrador
strapped with more corral for war than el salvador
foul style galore, verbal cow manure
comin' together like an eyebrow on al b. sure!
