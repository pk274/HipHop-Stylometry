yeah
i know sometimes
things may not always make sense to you right now
but ayy
what'd daddy always tell you?
straighten up, little soldier, stiffen up that upper lip
what you cryin' about?
you got me


hailie, i know you miss your mom, and i know you miss your dad
when i'm gone, but i'm tryna give you the life that i never had
i can see you're sad, even when you smile, even when you laugh
i can see it in your eyes, deep inside you wanna cry
'cause you're scared, i ain't there, daddy's witchu in your prayers
no more cryin', wipe them tears, daddy's hеre, no more nightmares
wе gon' pull together through it, we gon' do it
lainie—uncle's crazy, ain't he? yeah, but he loves you, girl, and you better know it
we're all we got in this world when it spins, when it swirls
when it whirls, when it twirls, two little beautiful girls
lookin' puzzled, in a daze, i know it's confusin' you
daddy's always on the move, momma's always on the news
i try to keep you sheltered from it, but somehow it seems
the harder that i try to do that, the more it backfires on me
all the things growin' up as daddy that he had to see
daddy don't want you to see, but you see just as much as he did
we did not plan it to be this way, your mother and me
but things have got so bad between us, i don't see us ever bein'
together ever again, like we used to be when we was teenagers
but then, of course, everything always happens for a reason
i guess it was never meant to be, but it's just something
we have no control over, and that's what destiny is
but no more worries, rest your head and go to sleep
maybe one day we'll wake up and this'll all just be a dream


now hush, little baby, don't you cry
everything's gonna be alright
stiffen that upper lip up, little lady, i told ya
daddy's here to hold ya through the night
i know mommy's not here right now, and we don't know why
we fear how we feel inside
it may seem a little crazy, pretty baby
but i promise momma's gon' be alright


heh, it's funny
i remember back one year when daddy had no money
mommy wrapped the christmas presents up and stuck 'em under the tree
and said some of 'em were from me 'cause daddy couldn't buy 'em
i'll never forget that christmas, i sat up the whole night cryin'
'cause daddy felt like a bum—see, daddy had a job but his job
was to keep the food on the table for you and mom and at the time
every house that we lived in either kept gettin'... on the block and your mom
was savin' money for you in a jar
tryna start a piggy bank for you so you could go to college
almost had a thousand dollars, 'til someone...
and i know it hurts so bad it broke your momma's heart
and it seemed like everything was just startin' to fall apart
mom and dad was arguin' a lot, so momma moved back
on to chalmers in the flat, one-bedroom apartment
and dad moved back to the other side of 8 mile on novara
and that's when daddy went to california with his cd
and met dr. dre and flew you and momma out to see me
but daddy had to work, you and momma had to leave me
then you started seein' daddy on the tv, and momma didn't like it
and you and lainie were too young to understand it
papa was a rolling stone, momma developed a habit
and it all happened too fast for either one of us to grab it
i'm just sorry you were there and had to witness it firsthand
'cause all i ever wanted to do was just make you proud
now i'm sittin' in this empty house just reminiscin'
lookin' at your baby pictures, it just trips me out
to see how much you both have grown, it's almost like you're sisters now
wow, guess you pretty much are, and daddy's still here
lainie, i'm talkin' to you too, daddy's still here
i like the sound of that, yeah, it's got a ring to it, don't it?
shh! momma's only gone for the moment


now hush, little baby, don't you cry
everything's gonna be alright
stiffen that upper lip up, little lady, i told ya
daddy's here to hold ya through the night
i know mommy's not here right now, and we don't know why
we fear how we feel inside
it may seem a little crazy, pretty baby
but i promise, momma's gon' be alright
and if you ask me to, daddy's gonna buy you a mockingbird
i'ma give you the world, i'ma buy a diamond ring for you
i'ma sing for you, i'll do anything for you to see you smile
and if that mockingbird don't sing and that ring don't shine
i'ma ... that birdie's ...
i'll go back to the jeweller who sold it to ya
don't ... with dad (haha)
