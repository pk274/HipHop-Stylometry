yeah, it's been a minute... this probably should have happened a while ago... fuck it we're here now though- let's go
yeah, man... what the fuck? yo, yo snoop (oh man) let me see them buds, man... that shit's the size of my hand, dogg- maybe i'll relapse, what the fuck...


that's how i know that i'm in the studio with the doggy
in californ-e, 'cuz my homie from long beach
always got that bomb weed, that's why i feel a calm breeze
every time i palm trees (get it) just like that blonde bleach
i went platinum, then so did my albums, calvin's turning me into a zombie
cuz these buds are like the hulk, they're twice the size that his arm be (his zombie)
and that is some strong green
got a contact, my contact lenses are foggy, i might end up in walgreen's
pharmacy with my arm asleep gone off lean mixed with dramamine
i will treat paula dean like a fuckin' human pinball machine
bouncin' balls off her tonsils, if ya'll are seekin' the smoke i got all the weed
i am a walking motherfuckin' marijuana leaf
and i'm here to stay
my reign's so definite (deaf in it) my longevity needs a hearing aid, still wearing hanes
t-shirts i done bodied some features with legendary names
was there when dre turned the chronic to monetary gain
'cause dope is addictive just like they call it marijuana, cause like marriage, you wanna, marry jane
it's like you and spiderman feel the very same
my adversaries came
but these little degenerates are my lineage, when it comes to pockets weren't many if, any as skinny as mine bitch, i was penniless
now i'm plenty rich, and the shit don't make any sense (cents) i was in a motherfucking pinch like a titty twist
now i'm sitting as pretty as each penny is, while i'm penning this in the lab on you guinea pigs
i'm finna' fool, i'm in effect, gimmie the semi and when i pull the big guns out
that trigger pull it until the motherfuckin' shit runs out of bullets
somebody better call an ambulance
you live, it will be miraculous, i got more hits than a contract killer
like caterpillars that don't got antennas, other words i don't got no god damn fillers (feelers)
mt. westmore, you did not plan for this- from detroit all the way to los angeles


put your doobies high, if you reside in 213
let's see them blunts raised
whether you eastside or westside of the 313
let's see them guns blaze
