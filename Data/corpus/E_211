ayo, 50, what i tell you?
we ain't even have to say shit
they did it, ha-ha


monkey see, monkey do
don't ever make the first move, just let 'em come to you
'cause they gon' always see and do what the other one do
so let 'em come to you, the rest'll just follow suit
monkey see, monkey do
tweedle-dee, tweedle-dum
if they really want it bad enough, well, then they gon' come
now here they come like we expected, now we just set 'em up
checkmate, motherfucker, game's over, we won
tweedle-dee, tweedle-dum


it doesn't take much for me to raise such a stank up
when motherfuckers hate your guts
you ain't even gotta say much
for me to put a pen to a blank sheet of paper
is like smearin' bloodstains with a paintbrush
i can’t explain what it is my brain does
but however it works, it's insane, it's plain nuts
and it ain't just my brain that’s dangerous
it’s a whole combination of things, it takes nuts
and i’m not afraid to raise the stakes up
i got a million bucks in the bank and eight trucks
for anybody who gets on a track and spanks us
i'm patiently waitin' for the day, i’m anxious
to see the look on your fake mugs when you thugs go bankrupt
you're drunk, you ain't tough
whatever you drank must of just turned you into some gangstas
this is me talkin', motherfucker, this ain’t drugs
you wanna pop shit, wake up then make up?
fuck that! it’s too late chump, now face up
i pray for the day that someone who spits
with the caliber that nas and jay does
opens up his jaws to say somethin' or rattle my name off
or rattle the first thing from the top of his brain off
so, i can blow the fuckin' dust off of this chainsaw
and give him the surgery that he came for
'til i peel the paint off, i never been shot
but i think me and 50 must've been cut from the same cloth
'cause i've always came off like ja's chain
when they tried to rush him and lost and came back
and gave him a watch in exchange for it
i don’t stop, only thing that i wait for
is the day that i ain't gotta report to probate court
'cause i'ma give you all a reason to hate more
'cause i been holdin' my tongue 'til i got a sprained jaw
a lot of rappers on my list, it just ain’t ja
and i'ma read that motherfucker off come april
you pussies think i went soft 'cause 8 mile
when i come back, i’ll be shootin' more than just paintballs
trust me


monkey see, monkey do
don't ever make the first move, just let 'em come to you
'cause they gon' always see and do what the other one do
so let 'em come to you, the rest'll just follow suit
monkey see, monkey do
tweedle-dee, tweedle-dum
if they really want it bad enough, well, then they gon' come
now here they come like we expected, now we just set 'em up
checkmate, motherfucker, game's over, we won
tweedle-dee, tweedle-dum

and by the way
we ain’t just talkin' to one person
we talkin' to every-motherfuckin'-body who wants to bring it
'cause we bringin' it to anybody who wants to bring it
