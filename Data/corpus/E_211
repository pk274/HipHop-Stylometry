yo!
tell the world to hold their breath, they're breathin' the wrong air
this planet belongs to me and this hippy with long hair
two white boys who spike punch and light joints
hang around drugs, loud music and like noise
slim shady and brown trucker another bunch of motherfuckers
who hate the world just as much as each other
and i ain't leavin' this party tonight
till i see some naked bitches dancing around drunk touchin' each other
rum and pepsi got your whole perception of me sketchy
'cause when i stage dive people are scared to catch me
'cause all i do is curse and fuck
so when i do shrooms you all better give me two rooms
'cause i'm fuckin' the first one up
so when you see me on your block, you better lock your cars
'cause you know i'm losin' it when i'm rappin' to rock guitars
this is for children who break rules
people that straight fools and every single teenager that hates school!
fuck off!
