a day without a rhyme
without a strong rhyme to step to
without a strong rhyme to step to
without a strong rhyme to step to


step into my world, let the lyrics lead the way
it's a place of escape that deviates from the everyday (uh)
a resort of a sort, it's for your mind though
so you relax them acts, and me, i let the rhyme flow (uh)
so you can follow it, chew it before you swallow it
the lyric is a delicate thing, you shouldn't holler it
and yell it (uh), just express it, give your lyrics your all
but remember one thing, a weak rhyme could be your downfall (uh) take it from me (uh, uh, uh) 'cause i'm a hip hop authority
poetry redemption is our number one priority (uh)
a day without a rhyme is like a day without sunshine
how can you unwind without a funky drum line? (uh)
i can't see it, let the ken wood kick
why? 'cause rhyming is my game, and the mic is like a joystick (uh)
i never lose, my lyrics sting like a hornet
i get ready for help, this for the town before the storm hits (uh)


(uh, uh, uh, uh)
(uh, uh, uh, uh)
(uh, uh, uh, uh)
(uh, uh, uh, uh)
without a strong rhyme to step to


perform is eternal, and in my lifetime
i hope i never have to see a day without a rhyme
legendary, the lyrical olympian
merciless and cruel, i rule 'cause i'm the champion
defending my position like a heavyweight fighter
a dope rap writer, deadly as a poisonous spider
yeah, no comparison, the women seem mysterious
my lyrics work as servants, leaving listeners delirious
under my hypnosis on the edge of their seat
it's like a science fiction movie, with groovy hip hop beats
so just relax and you'll enjoy the double feature
let my vocals take control of your soul, then let the rolling reach you (uh)
you can't ignore the dance floor anymore
the rhymes are mind blowing for the fancy and the hardcore
hip hop lovers who pump it as a past-time
the furthest sent from their mind, a day without a rhyme


a day without a rhyme
without a strong rhyme to step to
a day without a rhyme
without a strong rhyme to step to


floating atop a growing sea of mc's
liquidating sucker rappers like a fatal disease
that's right, i flick lives like boogers from my fingers
my assassin has my back, smoking dope just like a gunslinger
i'm just a merciless dog, you know the time (huh)
i'd rather die than go a day without a rhyme
you see, a lyric is a poet's personal emotion
a pocket full of holes, he throws a deep devotion
lyrical expression, keeps the roof constantly running
my craftiness and cunning makes the poetry so stunning
it's as dumb as it can be, there's not an mc who can hang with me
they like to battle but they never wanna bang with me
'cause i'm a real, dirty and dogmatic 
w-without a strong rhyme to step to
without a strong rhyme to step to
without a strong rhyme to step to
w-without a strong rhyme to step to
a day without a rhyme
yeah, dog, that was dope
