shit's finna get thick again
they say the competition is stiff
but i get a hard dick from this shit, now stick it in
i ain't never giving in again (yeah)
caution to the wind, complete freedom
look at these rappers, how i treat 'em
so why the fuck would i join 'em when i beat 'em? (yeah!)

snatch the mic from 'em, bitch, i'ma let you finish in a minute
yeah, that rap was tight, but i'm (yeah!)
'bout to spit the greatest verse of all time
so you might want to go back to the lab tonight and, um (yeah!)
scribble out them rhymes you were gonna spit
and start over from scratch and write new ones
but i'm afraid that it ain't gonna make no difference
when i rip this stage and tear it in half tonight
it's an adrenaline rush to feel the bass thump
from the place all the way to the parking lot, fellow
set fire to the mic and ignite the crowd (yeah)
you can see the sparks from hot metal (yeah)
cold-hearted, from the day i bogarted
the game, my soul started to rot, fellow (yeah)
when i'm not even in my harshest
you can still get roasted, 'cause marsh is not mellow
'til i'm topplin' from the top, i'm not gonna stop
i'm standin' on my monopoly board (uh)
that means i'm on top of my game
and it don't stop 'til my hip don't hop anymore (shit)
when you're so good that you can't say it
'cause it ain't even cool for you to sound cocky anymore (shit)
people just get sick 'cause you spit
these fools can't drool or dribble a drop anymore (ow!)
and you can never break my stride (nope)
you'll never slow the momentum at any moment, i'm 'bout to blow
you'll never take my pride
killin' the flow, slow venom and the opponent is gettin' no
mercy, mark my words
ain't lettin' up, relentless, i smell blood
i don't give a fuck, keep givin' them hell
where was you when i fell and needed help up?
