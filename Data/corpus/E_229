what would it take to push a man
far enough to put something material over a human life?
what would drive someone completely over the edge
to do some shit like that for green and gold?


i done filled my lungs up with so much of this crack smoke
my neck's bloated, my tec's loaded
i'm flat broke and i'm pissed off
mad at the world, i've had it with girls and i'm frustrated
ran to the bus stop just made it and hopped on
ready to drop bombs on the first person
who had a nice suit and a watch on
i spot john white collar worker in clean cut
walked up to him, he's like "what?"
what you mean "what?"
you know what time it is man
at your next stop gimme that rolex watch
with that diamond wristband
got his green and his gold dashed and climbed in his van
to steal it and seen a man holding a nine in his hand
shot him from the bottom up
stole his keys, put 'em inside the ignition and got 'em stuck
hopped out to flee on my feet
fucked around and forgot that i left my id on the seat
