ward, i think you were a little hard on the beaver
so was eddie haskell, wally, and ms. cleaver
this guy keeps screamin', he's paranoid
quick, someone get his ass another steroid!
"blah-badi-boo-blah, blah-blah-badi-bloo-blah!"
i ain't hear a word you said: "hippity hoopla!"
is that a tank-top or a new bra?
look! snoop dogg just got a fuckin' boobjob
didn't you listen to the last round, meathead?
pay attention, you're sayin' the same shit that he said
matter of fact, dawg, here's a pencil
go home, write some shit, make it suspenseful
and don't come back until somethin' dope hits you
fuck it, you can take the mic home with you
lookin' like a cyclone hit you
tank-top screamin', "lotto, i don't fit you!"
you see how far them white jokes get you
boys like, "how vanilla ice gon' diss you?"
my motto: "fuck lotto!"
i'll get the seven digits from your mother for a dollar tomorrow
