('cause) you did this to me (yeah, i'm)
right back on my bullshit, right back out in these streets
just remember that you did this to yourself (yeah, you did it to yourself)
but now you gotta suffer the consequences
(and "sorry" isn't gonna help, nah)


how many times have i got burnt and tried to act like i'm not hurt? (what?)
or take you back and we not work, like clockwork
this shit is agony, you're draggin' me, glocks burst
just remember, you drawed first
you ain't toe taggin' me, ho-bag, any blowback, you deserve
get the bozack, bitch (yeah), my soul's blackening
so actually, this could've been a lot worse (why?)
i could've name-dropped you in my verse (yeah)
but out of respect for your daughter
i won't blow your spot up 'cause your toddler
does not deserve to get caught up in our dirt (damn)
and good luck with her father
bitch, you're stuck with him now, ha-fuckin'-ha
word to the doctor, these are wounds you cannot nurse
hope it's drivin' you bonkers, that i'm not yours (oh no, woo)
guess i must've got wise, you are not sly
just 'cause you can make up an on-the-spot lie
i'm comin' out, guns blazin', shots fired
'hand sani', i'm cutting off 'tize' (ties)
bitch, everything you own's in a box, bye
guess it's back to the trailer and pot pies
hope i pull up to the window at popeyes
one day and you'll be servin' me hot fries 'cause (you did this to me)
taste of your own medicine
you shedded skin, yeah, you reptilian bitch
off of your knees (yeah), beggin' for forgiveness
yeah, look at you, marry him again, bitch
you ain't em's bitch, you're just regular him's bitch
we will never be together again, ever
and when you're in bed with him and you wish you was with me
just remember that


you did this to me (yeah, now)
i'm right back on my bullshit, right back out in these streets (look what you did)
just remember that you did this to yourself (yeah, you did it to yourself)
but now you gotta suffer the consequences
(and "sorry" isn't gonna help)
remember that (michelle) you did this to me (yeah)
i'm right back on my bullshit, right back out in these streets (fuck around and make you famous)
just remember that you did this to yourself (yeah, you did it to yourself)
but now you gotta suffer the consequences (oh no)
(so when i'm hittin' someone else and you're)
