good evening
this is your fucking captain speaking
we will soon be reaching an altitude of
four million and a half... feet
that's eight million miles in the sky
please, undo your seat belt for takeoff (chhk)
you are now free to smoke about the cabin (the cabin) (chhka)


speak of the devil, it's attack of the rain man
chainsaw in hand, bloodstain on my apron
soon as the blade spun, vrrunn, they run away from
who wanna play dungeon? no one is safe from
in search of a brain surgeon, a great one
wait, it ain't funny, man, it's urgent, i need one
two boxes of detergent in a paint gun
and an emergency squirt gun to spray a-1


so, one more time for old time's sake
dre, drop that beat and scratch that break
now just blow a little bit of that smoke my way
and let's go (i'm now smoking with the best)
i said, "one more time for old time's sake
dre, drop that beat and scratch that break
now just send a little bit of that smoke my way
and let's go (i'm now smoking with the best)"


smoke signal in the sky like verizon wireless
a nice environment, surprised entirely
hypnotized by the sound, i surround the hydrants
taking lives of firemen; say "goodbye", here i am again
naked wives and vicodin
before i begin to get so high, pussy boy, i could spin
vinn-vinn, fuck the handle, i fly off the hinge
let that boy off the bench, coach, and throw it to him
there he goes in his trench coat, no clothes again
baby, make us some french toast and show us some skin
i'll show you every inch grows on my foreskin
show me nipple, i pinch both, and throw up a ten
now you know it's a sin to tease, blow us again
the sorcerer of intercourse; if it's forced, it's him
don't fight the feeling if you're feeling the force within
and when you wake up in the morning next to the porcelain


so, one more time for old time's sake
dre, drop that beat and scratch that break
now just blow a little bit of that smoke my way
and let's go (i'm now smokin' with the best)
i said, "one more time for old time's sake
dre, drop that beat and scratch that break
now just send a little bit of that smoke my way
and let's go (i'm now smokin' with the best)"


nuh-uh, he ain't playin'
he's gon' get the ak and aim it right at your brain, hey
i'm slightly insane, hey, vodka and creatine
hpnotiq and red bull, it's an incredible energy drink
and it's given me wings, i believe i can fly
while i pee on a girl, you won't catch me csi
it's as easy as pie, and as simple as cake
dre, get on the mic and make 'em tremble and shake


well, smoke enough for me, fuck, yeah, light it up, cheech
come on, smoke me out cuz, give me contact buzz
get me on track, they love me when i'm on that stuff
but this is earth calling shady, man, come on back—what?
man, we're losing him, he won't even respond back, fuck!
now look at all the pretty women in here (damn, bitches!)
dre, it's hot, i think we better go check on their temperatures
i'll get the thermometer, you get the bandages
now, baby, just bend over, this won't hurt a damn bit, just—


give me one more time for old time's sake
dre, drop that beat and scratch that break
now just blow a little bit of that smoke my way
and let's go (i'm now smokin' with the best)
