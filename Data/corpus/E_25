hold on, faggot, let me turn this mic on
don't think for a minute i'ma let you get away with that song
'cause that shit was wack, you ain't spittin'
as a matter of fact, all of that shit was written
and i know it wasn't for me
surely, you really must adore me
now, look it… yo, you might as well move to italy
look, this guy's ripped – *skkkrr* – literally
you don't wanna really fuck with this
on this microphone, i'm not snuffleupagus
but i don't give a fuck, you can keep that dull rap
and turn your ass back around with your fuckin' skullcap
and your bandana or your motherfuckin' sweatband
fuckin' with this style, you're a dead man
i ain't redman, but on this mic, yo, i pick it up
just like your face when i had to rip it up
you don't wanna see me, yo, uh
