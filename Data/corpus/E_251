yep, yep
nothing high class in my glass, only bottles i pop
are bottles of pop so when i pop up in the spot
i'm prob-ably not gonna be wanting to pop bubbly or ciroc
i'm not puffy, but i'mma run the city tonight
when i hit it, i might act like a fricking idiot
diddy mixed with a medieval knight
big city lights, little indignity
hot diggity, this biggie is getting me hype
i don't get some liquor, i'll hurt you, i'll knock your dick in the dirt
bickering worse than that bitch in that snickers commercial
a mixture of stiffler and urkel, hanging from the light fixture
i hope you pricks are insured for this building 'cause we're tearing it down
security, get out the fricking way, jesus chrysler lebaron itâ€™s loud
i swear the only thing i hear is the sound
of sirens going "ahh, ahh"
'cause
