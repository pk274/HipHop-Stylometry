jigga-jigga-jigga-jigga-jigga like jay-z
jig is up, you fuckers who didn't write anything
are getting washed, liga-liga-liga, like bathing
young hova, i know hitters like yankees
gun toters that pull triggers like crazy
unloadin', leave you shot up in your rover
your body goes limp and slumps over
like a-rod in a month lull, but he just homered
hol' up, i said "rover" because now your rover is red
like red rover, so you know what i meant
but i roll over my opponents instead
makin' dog sounds 'cause i gotta keep breakin' these bars down
i'll go slow for the speds
but when i go (roof!) like the dobermann said
i still think the (roof!) would go over your head (ha-ha)
beast mode, motherfuckers 'bout to get hit
with so many foul lines, you'll think i'm a free throw
figured it was about time for people to eat crow
you about to get out-rhymed, how could i be dethroned?
i stay on my toes like the repo, a behemoth in sheep's clothes
from the east coast to the west, i'm the ethos and i'm the g.o.a.t
who the best, i don't gotta say a fuckin' thing, though
'cause mcs know
but you don't wanna hear me spit the facts
your shit is ass like a tailbone
or you're trapped in your cell phone
or my chicken scratch, or my self-loathe
i don't wanna fuckin' listen to you spit your raps someone else wrote
used to get beat up by the big kids
used to let the big kids steal my big wheel
and i wouldn't do shit but just sit still
now money's not a big deal
i'm rich, i wipe my ass with six mill'
big bills like a platypus
a caterpillar's comin' to get the cannabis
i'm lookin' for the smoke but you motherfuckers are scatterin'
batterin' everything and i've had it with the inadequate
man, i can see my dick is standin' stiff as a mannequin
and i'm bringin' the bandana back, and the fuckin' headband again
a handkerchief and i'm thinkin' of bringin' the fuckin' fingerless gloves back
and not giving a singular fuck, like fuck rap
i sound like a fuckin' millionaire
with a derringer with a hair trigger
'bout to bear hug a fuckin' terrier, the ric flair dripper
y'all couldn't hold a candle at a prayer vigil
when i vent, they compare me to a fuckin' air duct
i'm 'bout to bare-knuckle it, nah, fuck it
i'm gonna go upside their head with a nantucket
abraca-fuckin'-dabra
the track is the blood, i'm attracted, i'm attackin' it
what? dracula, fuck that shit
i'm up, back with a thud
man, stop
