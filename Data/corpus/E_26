well, jimmy moved in with his mother
'cause he ain't got no place to go
and now i'm right back in the gutter
with a garbage bag that's full of clothes (buss it, buss it, 'cause)
you live at home in a trailer
what the hell you gonna do? (yeehaw! haha)
'cause i live at home in a trailer
mom, i'm comin' home to you (uh, break it down, uh, yee!)


well, my name is jimmy, his name's greg buehl
me, him and you, we went to the same school
this ain't cool, i'm in a rage
he's tappin' my mom, we're almost the same age
on the microphone, i drop bombs
look at this car, thanks a lot, mom! (haha)
"here, happy birthday, rabbit
here's a brand new car, you can have it
a 1928 delta"
this shit won't even get me to the shelter
and i can't even say i'm from motown
'cause i'm back in the 810 now (ahahahahahaha)


'cause i live at home in a trailer (haha, haha)
