okay, folks, enough with the gay jokes
especially from a gay broke bitch yourself, eh, loc
this guy's doo-doo
you worked here longer than me, and i get paid more than you do
dawg, take a seat
what's this guy standin' in line for? he ain’t got money to eat!
check this out, yo, yo
this guy cashed his whole check and bought one ho ho
fuckin' homo! little maggot
you can’t hack it; paul's gay, you're a faggot
least he admits it, don’t even risk it
this guy's starvin' to death, someone get him a biscuit!
i don’t know what they told you, mike
you must have them cornrows rolled too tight
this job, you wanna quit, but you can't
you've worked at this plant so long, you're a plant
look at your goddamn boots!
for christ sakes, they're startin' to grow roots!
on this mic, you get faded
you look like a pissed-off rapper who never made it
and why you fuckin' with the gay guy, g?
when really you're the one who's got the hiv
man, i'm done with this clown, he's soft
fuck it, i'll let homegirl finish you off
