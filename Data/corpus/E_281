it has been said that there has been known to be bloodshed
over bread, men who have bled to death, dead
strapped to beds, pipe bombs, dynamite, lead
money, power, respect, street cred, yeah
it's scary, ain't it? picture yourself going out as a hero
picture mural pictures of us painted all over street corners
fans meet to mourn us, while we meet the coroners
notorious tried to warn us
we watched, so many piggybacked off of
biggie's back and 'pac's, landmarks, history in rap
statistically in fact; it's so sad to see us re-enact
these tragic events, which lead us back
to where we left off on march 9th
to come from such hard knock lives
and make it up out of 'em, hit the spotlights
and, once they're on us this is our lives
thrust out for all eyes to cast upon us
to see who can last the longest
and he who lasts the longest must be the strongest
in this concrete jungle where this dog eat dog mentality comes from
it's origin, which is usually originated from cats who starving
or it could just be somebody's aura, that just horri-fies
and applies to his persona or the sizes
in his entou-rage that intimidates the people
to the point that you know that he's gangster
he ain't just say shit, you just believe it
