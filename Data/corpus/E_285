yeah, guess who it is
ayo, dre! i think they in trouble (whoo!)
scott storch, why you have to do it like this to 'em?
feels like a new day!
listen


now every time i come
and i hit you niggas with shit regardless
you get retarded and then niggas ain't got a clue
on how the fuck i do what i do, and say what i say
and spit what i spit, you ain't never even gotta question who
‘cause you know that i'm the only nigga that can ever come
and spitefully turn the place in to a motherfuckin' zoo
then i come and i spit c-crazy sh-sh-sh-shit
and m-m-m-make n-n-niggas do exactly what i want 'em to
from my point of view, instead of trying to step up
you still trying to play catch up
and keep up with the way a nigga grew
these niggas panic and freakin' get schizophrenic
and let they emotions out
and i doubt they can ever test my crew
take a second, check it, i reckon my records are better than
whatever record you recorded, that's why your shit is through (whoo!)
you fuckin idiot, i don't think you get it
i'm one of the greatest ever, period, every syllable is true


shit on a mic and doodoo
my doo-doo, you do not have a fightin' chance to move
you were covered in my poo-poo
smothered in my manure while i spit saliva fluid do-do-do-do-do-do g-g-g-goobers are glued to you
you don't have a clue as to what we're about to do, do you?
so just sit back and watch somethin', you just gon' have an a-chew
you just made me sneeze, i'm allergic to beats like these
please excuse me, my allergies are actin' up; thanks a lot, scott
you're probably wonderin' why there's thunder
and everyone is runnin' and duckin' up
under everything up on the block
‘cause busta bus and flipmode just tip toed into the club
then with shady quietly trying not to start up a riot with doc
but since we all been spotted, we might as well have a party
so gather 'round everybody, come on, let's get our drink on
and you ain't got to do nothin' special for this occasion
just reach in the closet, put something on, and get to the club
