psst, hey, listen... haha (da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da)
i love my job (woo!)
makes me feel like ... superman! haha (da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da)
can you fly? i can, wanna see? psh

i'm only entertainin' you, my
goal is to stimulate, makin' you high
and take you and i
to a place that you can't see but i believe you can fly
i don't mean nobody harm, i'm just partyin'
i'm not your dad, not your mom, not your guardian
just the man who's on the mic
so let me entertain you (yeah)


my lyrical content is constantly under fire
no wonder why i constantly bomb back
to combat attacks with constant concepts
when lyrics are constantly took outta context
failure to communicate with congress has
been a problem for the longest, i guess, but
maybe one day we can make some progress
food for thought, see how long it takes to digest
feelin' good when i should be ashamed
shit, i really shoulda fell, but i stood, see, i came
like a flame in the night, like a ghost in the dark
there's a ray, there's a light, there's a hope, there's a spark
but when planets collide they'll never see eye to eye
until they decide to set their differences aside
and this is why only one of us will survive
so children, follow my lead and feel the vibe, because


i'm only entertainin' you, my
goal is to stimulate, makin' you high
and take you and i
to a place that you can't see but i believe you can fly
i don't mean nobody harm, i'm just partyin'
i'm not your dad, not your mom, not your guardian
just the man who's on the mic
so let me entertain you (yeah)


my music can be slightly amusin'
you shouldn't take lyrics so serious, it might be confusin'
tryin' to separate the truth from entertainment
it's stupid, ain't it? i get sick of tryin' to explain it
see, i could sit and argue with you, but it goes beyond
just being a snot, pointy-nosed bleach-blond
'cause i came here to uplift, let your woes be gone
tell 'em to get fucked and just mosey on
constantly movin', constantly usin'
the constitution as a form of restitution
bless the children, nothin' less than brilliant
let me entertain you like robbie williams
i'll be here when y'all are gone, rebuildin'
world revolvin', still evolvin', still slim
how many kids’ll copy? prob'ly millions
but i'ma do this as a fuckin' hobby 'til then, 'cause


i'm only entertainin' you, my
goal is to stimulate, makin' you high
and take you and i
to a place that you can't see but i believe you can fly
i don't mean nobody harm, i'm just partyin'
i'm not your dad, not your mom, not your guardian
just the man who's on the mic
so let me entertain you (yeah)


my lyrical content contains subject matter
that sucks up all these fucked-up young kids
at a alarming rate, common denominate
add it up, and you'll see just why i dominate
i try to stimulate, but kids emulate
and mimic every move you make, "slim, you great!"
but wait, can't you see i'm only here to entertain?
i gotta be the one to go against the grain
'cause, man, i see it, feel it, live it, but it's inhumane
for me to see you be influenced and pretend you ain't
but they don't understand that i've been through pain
if you get to know me i could be a friend you gain
but you can't just stand there and try to judge
it hurts but your jealousy probably tears you up inside as much
and it's such a pleasure, every button that i touch
i treasure every glutton that i punish in my lust, but


i'm only entertainin' you, my
goal is to stimulate, makin' you high
and take you and i
to a place that you can't see but i believe you can fly
i don't mean nobody harm, i'm just partyin'
i'm not your dad, not your mom, not your guardian
just the man who's on the mic
so let me entertain you (yeah)
