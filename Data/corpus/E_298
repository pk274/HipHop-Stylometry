the one man on the planet that'll drive off of the grand canyon
hop out of a grand am and land in it handstanding
any man planning to battle will get snatched out of his clothes
so fast it'll look like an invisible man standing
i'm headed for hell, i'd rather be dead or in jail
"bill clinton, hit this and you better inhale"
cause any emcee that chooses to go against me
is getting taking advantage of like monica lewinsky
came home in a frenzy, pushing a ten-speed
screaming at aunt peg
with three spokes sticking out of my pant leg
eff a headache, give me a migraine, damn it, i like pain
and you should be anywhere that a mic ain't
you rap knowing you wack
you act up and i'm throwing you down a flight of steps
then i'm throwing you back up 'em
if they don't like the track, fuck 'em
the rap struck 'em harder than getting hit by a mack truck
and then backed up on
and any half-assed known rapper that trespass
better be ready for the second celebrity deathmatch
so tell the medic to bring the medication and quickly
i'm sicker than a 2pac dedication to biggie
i'm free-falling feet first out of a damn tree
to stampede your chest 'til you can't breathe
and when i'm down to my last breath
i'm a climb the empire state building
get to the last step and still have half left


this 9 is lifting you six feet when i spray rounds
hit you with six shots in mid-air and four more on the way down
as eight strays graze through a kid's hair on the playground
you lay down on a stretcher (don't get carried away now)
no pun intended, just hop out of this whip
and leave it unattended 'fore i whip out this gun and end it
unless you want it dented with bullet holes in one minute
cause i can leave your infinit' full of those even if someone's in it
snatch the airbag, hit the corner and park it
corner the market, i got her tied up in a chair and gagged
bitches get slapped and grabbed by the hair and dragged
like cavewomen while i'm gravedigging with marilyn mans'


what a wonderful day, i should go outside and play
ain't no need to sit inside the house and hibernate
"hi, ren√©e, i was just about to toss a live grenade
in your driveway and drive away
are you afraid of a blade made of a razor with aids?"
blood dripping from it
ripping your stomach up from the waist up
you talk a lot of ish, but you was never ill though
i'm sick enough to beat you to death with a feather pillow
tipped over some cows just for a joke and a laugh
jumped up, choked a giraffe, snapped his neck and broke it in half
waging wars, went on stage and sprayed cage with agent orange
and wiped my ass with his page in source
demon is here, i'm steaming this year
i rip mystikal's voice box out and scream in his ear
it's not a gimmick, trick, it's an image, i live it
give a what? i don't know what a "what" is to give it


forget a chorus, my metaphors are so complicated
it takes six minutes to get applause
and by the time you all catch on, i'm a end your career
and walk away with the floor, so you have nothing to fall back on
i'll throw you out of ten floors
pull a freaking headache out of my head and put it in yours
i'm indoors, waiting for this acid to seep in my skin pores
to go outdoors and do some in-stores
this trick wanted to blow me, i said, "it ought to happen"
"you swallow nut, girl?" "no, but i brought a napkin"
getting skully while i'm autographing
got my daughter laughing
cause i sent her mother white water rafting
i'm not a fact, i'm a proven fear
mr. rogers blocking my u-haul
screaming, "you ain't moving here"
"lorena bobbitt, come here, want a souvenir?
i've been high as "l" since i was a juven-eer
juvenile? same difference, i need some 'caine
cause i ain't sniffed since i woke up to seven slain infants
brain implants and they say there's a slim chance
i won't stay the same cause i traded brains with a chimpanz'
