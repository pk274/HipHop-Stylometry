mhmmm *inhales*
you high, baby?
yeah, hahahaha
yeah?
talk to me
you want me to tell you something?
uh-huh
i know what you wanna hear


they call me superman
leap tall hoes in a single bound
i'm single now: got no ring on this finger now
i'd never let another chick bring me down
in a relationship; save it, bitch!
babysit? you make me sick
superman ain't savin' shit
girl, you can jump on shady's dick
straight from the hip, cut to the chase
i tell a muhfuckin' slut to her face
play no games, say no names
ever since i broke up with what's-her-face
i'm a different man, kiss my ass
kiss my lips? bitch, why ask?
kiss my dick, get my cash?
i'd rather have you whip my ass
don't put out? i'll put you out
won't get out? i'll push you out
puss blew out, poppin' shit
wouldn't piss on fire to put you out
am i too nice? buy you ice?
bitch, if you died, wouldn't buy you life
what, you tryin' to be my new wife?
what, you mariah? fly through twice


but i do know one thing though
bitches, they come, they go
saturday through sunday, monday (yeah-yeah)
monday through sunday, yo
maybe i'll love you one day
maybe we'll someday grow
'til then just sit your drunk ass on that fuckin' runway, ho


‘cause i can't be your superman, can't be your superman
can't be your superman, can't be your superman
i can't be your superman, can't be your superman
can't be your superman, your superman, your superman


don't get me wrong, i love these hoes
it's no secret, everybody knows
yeah, we fucked—bitch, so what?
that's about as far as your buddy goes
we'll be friends, i'll call you again
i'll chase you around every bar you attend
never know what kinda car i'll be in
we'll see how much you'll be partyin' then
you don't want that, neither do i
i don't wanna flip when i see you with guys
too much pride, between you and i
not a jealous man, but females lie
but i guess that's just what sluts do
how could it ever be just us two?
i'd never love you enough to trust you
we just met and i just fucked you


but i do know one thing though
bitches, they come, they go
saturday through sunday, monday
monday through sunday, yo
maybe i'll love you one day
maybe we'll someday grow
'til then just sit your drunk ass on that fuckin' runway, ho


‘cause i can't be your superman, can't be your superman
can't be your superman, can't be your superman
i can't be your superman, can't be your superman
can't be your superman, your superman, your superman
‘cause i can't be your superman, can't be your superman
can't be your superman, can't be your superman
i can't be your superman, can't be your superman
can't be your superman, your superman, your superman


first thing you say: i'm not fazed
i hang around big stars all day
i don't see what the big deal is anyway
you're just plain old marshall to me
ooh yeah, girl, run that game
hailie jade, i love that name
love that tattoo, what's that say?
"rot in pieces," uh, that's great
first off, you don't know marshall
at all, so don't grow partial
that's ammo for my arsenal
i'll slap you off that bar stool
there goes another lawsuit
leave handprints all across you
good lordy, whoadie
you must be gone off that water bottle
you want what you can't have
ooh girl, that's too damn bad
don't touch what you can't grab
end up with two backhands
put anthrax on a tampax
and slap you 'til you can't stand
girl, you just blew your chance
don't mean to ruin your plans


but i do know one thing though
bitches, they come, they go
saturday through sunday, monday
monday through sunday, yo
maybe i'll love you one day
maybe we'll someday grow
'til then just sit your drunk ass on that fuckin' runway, ho


‘cause i can't be your superman, can't be your superman
can't be your superman, can't be your superman
i can't be your superman, can't be your superman
can't be your superman, your superman, your superman
‘cause i can't be your superman, can't be your superman
can't be your superman, can't be your superman
i can't be your superman, can't be your superman
can't be your superman, your superman, your superman


‘cause i can't be your superman, can't be your superman
can't be your superman, can't be your superman
i can't be your superman, can't be your superman
can't be your superman, your superman, your superman
‘cause i can't be your superman, can't be your superman
can't be your superman, can't be your superman
i can't be your superman, can't be your superman
can't be your superman, your superman, your superman
