look down at the floorboard
looks like someone left a pair of stiletto shoes in my tahoe
never know just what type of a ho inside of my ride i may let
last night went to 5:00 a.m., and she ain't even recover from last friday yet
hoes all over the ride like it's an ice cream truck, i can see why they fret
i already ran over two hoes and i ain't get out the fuckin' driveway yet (agh!)
soon as i open the door you try to resist
what for? get in girl, don't front, shorty, you're
fighting an un-winnable war, it's useless as tits on a bull or little tits on a whore
got 'em acting like spoiled brats kickin' and screamin'
like little kids throwing fits on the floor
get in the whip, but you ain't turning this frog into a prince
why you tryna keep convincing me for?


i want a (hey) kiss (hey), kiss (hey), kiss (hey)
you won't get one
i want a (hey) kiss (hey), kiss (hey), kiss (hey)
not from me
i want a (hey) kiss (hey), kiss (hey), kiss (hey)
not on the lips, are you crazy?
i want a (hey) kiss (hey), kiss (hey), kiss (hey)
maybe the cheek, but that's all you gon' get from me


now you in my whip just as long as you understand that i can't be whipped
you say, "companionship," i say "abandon ship"
i'm a gigolo, so you know i'm always on the go
i don't got no time to slow down for no relation-shit
drop the "p" and add a "t"
yeah, you can get mad at me all you want
but i'm ghost before you can even say, "boo," hun, let alone call me one
a one night stand is all he wants with a female fan, yeah, one like stan
and he's so about a one nightstand
his bedroom has two lamps and only one nightstand (oh)
get the hint?
ooh yeah boo â€“ ew
i ain't finna argue, but why do you think they call it boo?
yeah, 'cause the sound of it s'posed to scare you


i want a (hey) kiss (hey), kiss (hey), kiss (hey)
you won't get one
i want a (hey) kiss (hey), kiss (hey), kiss (hey)
not from me
i want a (hey) kiss (hey), kiss (hey), kiss (hey)
not on the lips, are you crazy?
i want a (hey) kiss (hey), kiss (hey), kiss (hey)
maybe the cheek, but that's all you gon' get from me


nickel nina nigga twitter beefing, first rapper that shot a fan
push a chick out the car while it's moving like waka's man (agh)
her bottom's dark, but her top is tan, her private parts
got her on the pole, like the opposite of her papa's plans
come on stripper! let's hit the strip, one-eighty, throw it in reverse and drop the trans
i'm in a trance, now look at this bitch dance
looking at this tramp like, "what are you wearing, girl? quit playing"
yeah, bitch in them scratch and sniff pants
well let me scratch 'em, let me sniff, yeah, what? did i say that?
i'm on lean like styrofoam cups and kickstands


middle finger stuck on fuck, stiff hands
but, girl, you got a butt like no if ands
so yeah, what the hell, maybe
all hail shady, he'll tell it like it is
so tell katy perry he's on her tail, he's tailgating
these bells are my mating call and i'm here
bell's waiting, and tell lady
gaga, she can quit her job at the post office, she's still a male lady (oh!)
wouldn't fuck her with her dick, you heard it, the verdict's in
he's allergic to divas and take meat cleavers to 'em
him don't give a damn about beaver, do him
what a demon, a behemoth, evil just seems to be seething through him


my god, trick, my dick is hard, as stiff as a yardstick
what are we gonna do? ride around 'til we're carsick?
i'ma put this shit in park like dog shit
and you can blow me in the dark
in the parking lot of the trailer park by the garbage
what're you waitin' on, me to roll out the carpet?
condoms are in the glove compartment, let's start it
think i'm jokin'?
what, am i sitting here tryna make fake farts with my armpits?
tryna get you to spit pop through your nose?
am i here to amuse you? stop it


and if you ain't sucking a dick, why you sitting there with puckered lips?
oh that's collagen, muhfuckin' bitch
what you mean how'd you get suckered into this?
you gon' jump into my truck and then try to get truculent
you should be suffering, you should be cooking
you should be buckling your seat belt with oven mitts
excuse me while i make an ass out of myself
but it's only because i just wanna get


i want a (hey) kiss (hey), kiss (hey), kiss (hey)
you won't get one
i want a (hey) kiss (hey), kiss (hey), kiss (hey)
not from me
i want a (hey) kiss (hey), kiss (hey), kiss (hey)
not on the lips, are you crazy?
i want a (hey) kiss (hey), kiss (hey), kiss (hey)
maybe the cheek, but that's all you gon' get from me
