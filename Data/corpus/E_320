they think they're crazy, but they ain't crazy, let's face it
shit, basically they're just playing sick
they ain't shit, they ain't saying shit, spray 'em 50
a to the k, get in the way i'll bring dre and them with me
and turn this day into fucking mayhem, you staying with me?
don't let me lose you, i'm not trying to confuse you
when i let loose with this uzi and just shoot through your isuzu
you get the message? am i getting through to you?
you know what's coming, you motherfuckers don't even know, do you?
take some big and some pac and you mix em up in a pot
sprinkle a little big l on top, what the fuck do you got?
you got the realest and illest killers tied up in a knot
the juggernauts of this rap shit, like it or not
it's like a fight to the top just to see who'd die for the spot
you put ya life in this, nothing like surviving a shot
y'all know what time it is, soon as 50 signs on this doc
shit what you know about death threats, cause i get a lot
shady records was eighty seconds away from the towers
some cowards fucked with the wrong building, they meant to hit ours
better evacuate all children, it's nuclear showers
there's nothing spookier
you now about to witness the power of (death row)
