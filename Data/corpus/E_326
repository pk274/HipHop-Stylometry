by the time you hear this, i will have already spiralled up
i would never do nothin' to let you cowards fuck my world up
if i was you i would duck, or get struck like lightnin'
fighters keep fightin', put your lighters up, point 'em skyward, uh
had a dream, i was king; i woke up, still king
this rap game's nipple is mine for the milking
'til nobody else even fuckin' feels me, 'til it kills me
i swear to god i'll be the fuckin' illest in this music
there is, or there ever will be, disagree? feel free
but from now on i'm refusing to ever give up
only thing i ever gave up's using no more excuses
excuse me if my head is too big for this building
and pardon me if i'm a cocky prick, but you cocks are slick
poppin' shit on how you flipped your life around, crock of shit
who you dicks tryna kid? flip "dick," you did opposite
you stayed the same 'cause "cock" backwards is still "cock," you pricks!
i love it when i tell 'em shove it
‘cause it wasn’t that long ago when marshall sat flustered
lacked luster ‘cause he couldn’t cut mustard
muster up nothin', brain fuzzy
‘cause he’s buzzin’, woke up from that buzz and
now you wonder why he does it how he does it
wasn’t ‘cause he had buzzards
circlin' around his head, waitin' for him to drop dead, was it?
or was it ‘cause some bitches wrote him off?
little hussy-ass scuzzes
fuck it, guess it doesn’t matter now, does it?
what difference it make? what’s it take?
to get it through your thick skulls that this ain’t
some bullshit; people don’t usually come back this way
from a place that was dark as i was in just to get to this place
now let these words be like a switchblade to a hater’s ribcage!
and let it be known that from this day forward, i wanna just say
thanks, ‘cause your hate is what gave me the strength
so let them bics raise, ‘cause i came with 5'9", but i feel like i’m 6'8"
