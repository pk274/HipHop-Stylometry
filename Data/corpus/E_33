terrible, but not rip-able, invincible, i hung invisible
fuckin' mistletoe over the world, i stuck my ass up under it
now pucker up them lips and kiss it, hoes *kiss*
here we go, bad and evil so you know how this'll go
the competition's miserable, we stomp them bitches, this is no
joke, goin' overboard like someone threw us off the boat
choke *cough*, cough from all the smoke, i'm tryna stay on fire
so you know if i hate fucking' water sprinklers, i don't love the hose (oh)
someone let the cat out the bag, now it's time to stuff its face
baggin' that bitch, smother that little motherfucker 'til it suffocates (who?)
you had long enough of a wait, why are they
tryin' to be so secretive? bad and evil is reunited, hey!
came back to annihilate, the game's in dire straights as i await
word on satan is i drop, fall on my knees before this
ouija board and i pray, now i lay me down to sleep
i do this shit in my sleep, iâ€™m sleepin' now, imagine if i awake?
i'm champ, bitch, i'll never taste the canvas
could never be no damn wuss or pussy
never mushy, so you can't squish
nowhere near a tush, in fact if i jump out a bush
in a sneak attack's, the only way i'll say i am bush
outlandish, these words are weapons that i brandish
stand-offish to hoes, keep your hands off this
can't top it, so what the fuck would i sugarcoat it for?
law? fuck protocol, i'd holla at this ho, but now my throat is sore


sometimes life seems so unfortunate
that's why i don't give a shit (oh-oh-oh-oh)
the poor stay poor, the rich get richer (oh-oh)
it's just so disproportionate (ah-ah)
you don't know just what i go through
that's why i would rather show you
just how far that i can take it, every rule, i'm breakin' it (royce!)
