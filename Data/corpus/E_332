your body language is sayin’ your confidence is gone
well, pick ya ass up, lil' homie, come on
you just gon' sit there and take it or make 'em suck it?
tell 'em where to shove it straight up
you gon' make love to the world or you gon' fuck it?
the last time that life kicked me in the ass
i pulled down its pants and put a foot up its ass
man, what a catastrophe it’d be for me to be a bitch-ass pussy
and not open a can of whoop-ass, let you piss-ants whoop me
will be the day i say i ate poop, shit, the day that
i don't straight shoot, i'll drop outta my anti-women hate group
say i’m a sissy faggot, record it, play it back
and put it on straight loop, you haters look like you ate a grape fruit
to see me climbing back on that wagon, got my swagger back
i was dragging, hopped back on it, grab the reigns on that bastard
and came back on 'em without remorse
man, of course, i’m a one-trick pony
'cause i’ll be screaming on these whores 'til i’m hoarse!


there's a bomb inside my head, i’m a live wire
i am on the edge, teetering on it like a totter, i might
get on a nut like a tire iron, i have no desire stopping
so why would i drop and roll? that's how much on fire i am
rappers are fun and i’m the time 'cause i’m just flying by ‘em
man, i’m laughing at ‘em the entire time, why am i up?
'cause tribulations i have triumphed, bitch, i’m fired up
"so one time for me, just let your fuckin' lighters light the sky up"
