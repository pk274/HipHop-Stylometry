life handed me lemons, i jumped back in the public eye
and squirted lemon juice in it, by now, you just wish i’d fuckin’ die
but i electrify, get electrocuted, executed by the execution
of my flow, too quick for the human eye to detect zoomin’ by
choom-chigga-choom-choom-choom-choom waa
yep, yep—guess who, what’s happenin’, guy?
they told me to shit, i fell off that pot
hopped right back on that crapper and i
said, “fuck it,” with a capital i, look who’s back to antag-g-onize
you don’t like it? you can eat shit, fuck off, little faggot, and die
you right back like a magnet on my dick grabbin’ at my
shit, better get to the back of the line
if you wanna get your shot at me, what kinda crap is that battle?
what kind of rapper would i be
'fore i let another rapper think he’s hot?
i'll bury my face in his stinky twat and go (*licking*)
girl, my head space is limited
ain’t even room in the back of my mind
that’s why i ain’t thinking about you, i don’t got time
i done told you a thousand times
so how can i find the time to put
an alkaline battery in royce’s back
and at the same time put juice in mine?
goddammit, slaughterhouse is signed!
