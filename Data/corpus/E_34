it's shit like this i kick to these rich white kids
who just might see how fucked up their sick life is
oops, i did it again, didn't i?
my shit's harder to figure out than what britney's tit size is
ooh, i probably pissed you off again, didn't i, bitch?
so what? you and christina gaguilera, kiss my grits
you know how many shits i give? i wish i did
so i can quit giving these twisted little kids ideas
this just in: britney just dissed justin
she just fucked ben, got tit-fucked and dick-sucked him
if affleck can get his ass licked, how come i can't?
shit, god damn, bitch, i'm rich, i can't understand this
are those pictures i made of us together on the internet
as close as i'm ever gonna get to hitting it from the back?
and shit, when it comes to that, i hit harder from the back
than everlast when he's plugging lethal in his fucking ass
just give me one more chance, britney hit me one more time
let me know what's on your mind, whitney give me one more line
to sniff, you fuckers know what time it is
fuck your jewelry, my record's almost diamond, biatch!
(yah-yah-yah-yah!)


what's going on in the world today?
people fighting, feuding, looting, it's okay
let it go, let it flow, let the good times roll
tell 'em, dre! (it ain't nuttin' but music)

now what's these parents all mad for?
"your music is bad for 'em"
for teenage kids that drink more than ted danson in cheers
carson drink beers, we all fart and piss and cuss out our bitch (shut up!)
broke or rich, i still do that same old shit
i don't jump in front of a camera and change no shit
so when they ask me about my sarcasticness
i just slap 'em (ah!), turn around and ask them this
(yah-yah-yah-yah!)
