many men
many, many, many, many men
wish death 'pon me
lord, i don't cry no more
(you know what's comin'? you motherfuckers don't even know, do you?)
have mercy on me
have mercy on my soul
(dont let me lose you, im not tryin to confuse you)
have mercy on many men
(you get the message? am i gettin' through to you?)
(you're now- you're now about to witness the power)


see, the problem is i speak to suburban kids
who otherwise would've never knew these words exist
whose moms prob'ly would've never gave two squirts of piss
'til i created so much motherfuckin' turbulence
straight out the tube, right into your livin' rooms i came
and kids flipped when they knew i was produced by dre
that's all it took, and they were instantly hooked right in
and they connected with me too, because i looked like them
that's why they put my lyrics up under this microscope
searchin' with a fine tooth comb, it's like this rope
waitin' to choke, tightenin' around my throat
watchin' me while i write this, like, "i don't like this note!"
all i hear is: lyrics, lyrics, constant controversy
sponsors workin' 'round the clock to try to stop my concerts early
surely hip-hop was never a problem in harlem, only in boston
after it bothered the fathers of daughters startin' to blossom
so now i'm catchin' the flak from these activists when they raggin'
actin' like i'm the first rapper to smack a bitch or say "faggot", shit
just look at me like i'm your closest pal
the poster child, the motherfuckin' spokesman now, ha-ha


many men
many, many, many, many men
wish death 'pon me
lord, i don't cry no more
(you know what's comin'? you motherfuckers don't even know, do you?)
have mercy on me
have mercy on my soul
(dont let me lose you, im not tryin to confuse you)
have mercy on many men
(you get the message? am i gettin' through to you?)
(you're now- you're now about to witness the power)
