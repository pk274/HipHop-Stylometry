in the beginning a few of the people who had a problem i was this good scoffed, i just shook off
prob'ly reminded you of the first time you saw tiger woods golf
never thought about how much my race and nationality meant
but based on how i ascended
see how plain it was now, they want me to jet
but no one really gave a fuck about my descent, 'til i took off
mistook me because i looked soft
but i stood tall, i just followed the doctor's orders
so i rose and grew balls, told these hoes to screw off
decided opposing you is what i'm ‘posed to do, all's
i did was say what i'm feeling when the vocal booth calls
and had you on pins and needles when i spoke to you all
you felt my pain, it's almost like i poked voodoo dolls
and i hope my spirit haunts the studios when i'm gone
my picture jumps off a poster and just floats through the halls
and fuckin' goes through the walls like the ghost of lou rawls
karma's headed for armageddon
the drama setter, i'm going in, already got an arm and head in
whoever said words are just words ain't heard me word 'em
i give a fuck if my image even ends up taking a personal hit
whoever i hurt or whatever bridges i burned in this bitch
and whatever bitches feel like they didn't deserve what they get
and whatever consequences come with every verse
it's worth it, so doc, turn the beat on
whose turn is it to get murdered on it?
and here's to all the years i spent toein' a line to overtime
as sure as a mole is blind
in my mind i'm still underground as a groundhog
and i'ma go for mine, like a whole furrow just tryna dig up some gold and diamonds and coal to find
no signs of slowin', these lines are my 9's
i just load up the most rhymes and open fire with a closed mind
all i needed was someone to co-sign
been a doctor's assault rifle
with the sniper scope for this whole time
day one, say when to blast, just give me the order, i spray (uh)
pain in the ass, you'll get shot in the ass with a paint gun
ain't no one safe from, non-believers there ain't none
i even make the bitches i rape cum
i'm waitin' on someone to say somethin'
dre, make the bass pump!
and let the tape run for old time's sake!
i spit it straight through, this is take one
the moment you're waitin' for has come, but the—
