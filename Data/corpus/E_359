mic check, one, two
do unto others as you would have them do to you
no, that's not the way i work because when i rhyme i'm a jerk
i grab the mic and start dissing
all these mc's and try to put them into submission
take them out for the count because the amount i throw is so deaf
word! deaf didn't rhyme but i
on your windshield just like a turd
every time that i rhyme you know that i'm
going to climb to the tip-tip-top and i'm
not going to stop 'cause i grab the mic and dop-da dop dop
i fucked up, but that's alright because my luck's up
no it's not, 'cause here i am, i got a lot to give
and i don't live positive, now i'm not saying i'm negative
but if i grab the mic i do mega kits
every time that i grab the mic you know that m&m is gonna be rolling his tongue just like this
and then i go do a funky rhyme and if any mc steps up he gets fucking dissed
bad, don't call me dad
vanilla ice said that, that made me mad
so when i step to the mic
know that i gotta clear my throat and excite
i'm trying to get the mic cord away from the stereo so i can bust some material
i take it around my leg, and then all the mc's wanna beg
and say "yo, please give me a turn!"
i say "no" because it's my turn to burn
and i bust a rhyme like this and you can't step to a rhyme that i do 'cause you're dissed!
you're dissed so bad every time
sure, he don't get a turn, and he's starting to get mad but i'm
just going to take the mic
i'm not gonna give it to him because i am
so damn hyped in the place to be
rhyming like this 'cause i'm an mc
rhyming so deaf to the happy ass beat
it's kinda gay like liberace but hey
listen to the words that i display every time i kick a rhyme this way
you know that the star is worthwhile, every time i grab the mic i'm longer than a mile
