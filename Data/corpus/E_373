football, football, i love football
yes, tres, dos, uno
dos, tres, fuck, shit, bitch, asshole, son of a bitch
everybody cuddle, blah i mean huddle
i just stepped in a mud puddle, butthole
freak, who just tapped on my ass cheek?
nevermind, let's try quarterback sneak
cover me, smother me with love that's brotherly
that didn't work, try another play
hut one, hut two, hut hut, hurry up
i'm reaching up another grown man's butt
hike the ball, i mean i like bizarre
but jesus, he hikes, i think i can feel his balls
my dick is long as it is hard, yeah, so are my balls
it's the longest yard, whoops that's not the chorus
run it back, wrong song, yeah disregard
that whole statement i just made, what yard line we on?
our own 5 and our timeouts are gone
less than a minute left, i just throw my ball
to the sideline to von, he steps out of bounds
48 seconds left on the clock but every last one counts
call another huddle, we're down by six
the plan is, to throw the ball to swift
but he's so god dang high that he trips
falls and slips, proof grabs him by his fingertips
and runs the ball all the way down to the one
but he don't get in, but all we need is a put, put.. *mumbles*
but all we need is a touch down and an extra point to win
but then i get sacked all the way back to the ten
god dammit i'mma slap somebody if i get tapped on the ass again
everybody's laughing now, no timeouts and its now fourth down
we're never gonna make it, wait, i just got an idea
quick, everybody get naked, denaun go long
i'mma throw the bomb, c'mon how they gonna tackle you with no pants on
ass out with a flopping schlong, touchdown! yeah, i told you
it's the longest yard


catch me if you can but you ain't man enough
you're standing tough
but you know that no matter what
you'll never get the chance to touch
my ballz, ballz, ballz
ballz, ballz, ballz
you'll never touch my ballz


catch me if you can but you ain't man enough
you're standing tough
but you know that no matter what
you'll never get the chance to touch
