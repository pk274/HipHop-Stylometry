i don't know, dude
i think everybody's all jealous and sh**
'cause i'm, like, the lead singer of the band, dude
and i think everybody's got a fricking problem with me, dude
and they need to take it up with me after the show
because


these chicks don't even know the
name of my band
but they're all on me like they
wanna hold hands
'cause once i blow, they know
that i'll be the man
all because i'm the lead
singer of my band


so i get off stage, right? drop the mic
walk up to these hot chicks, and i'm all like:
"sup, ladies? my name's slim shady
i'm the lead singer of d12, baby"
they're all like, "oh my god, it's him
becky, oh my fricking god, it's eminem
i swear to fucking god, dude, you fricking rock
please, marshall, please, let me suck your-"
now by now, the rest of the fellas get jealous
especially when i drop the beat and do my a capellas
all the chicks start yelling, all the hot babes
throw their bras and their shirts and their panties on stage
so, like every single night, they pick a fight with me
but when we fight, it's kinda like sibling rivalry
'cause they're back on stage the next night with me
dude, i just think they're tryna steal the light from me
yesterday, kuniva tried to pull a knife on me
'cause i told him jessica alba's my wife-to-be
this rock star sh**? it's the life for me
and all the other guys just despise me because these


these chicks don't even know the
name of my band
but they're all on me like they
wanna hold hands
'cause once i blow, they know
that i'll be the man
all because i'm the lead
singer of my band
