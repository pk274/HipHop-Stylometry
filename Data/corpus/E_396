i'm not a cheater, but if i'ma be accused, might as well be
you tell me you'll take me back when hell freezes, but females be rushin' me outside my telly, temptation overwhelms me
like my monthly bill from sprint, they chargin' me for a selfie
chargin' me, so i gave my hotel key (uh, i was tryna be nice)



you're such a nice guy, a nice guy
you're faithful, you don't lie
after the club, you'll go back home, right?
right? sike


suck my dick, you fuckin' suck, bitch
suck my dick, (bi-) you fuckin' suck, man
i hope that your heart get hit by a semi-truck (bi-)
suck my dick, you fuckin' suck, bitch


i'm an emotional wreck, weak (uh-huh)
everything over-affects me (yeah)
when you joke, it upsets me (yeah)
you say i'm no good at sex
and you think i'm gross and unsexy (uh-huh)
i need scope 'cause my breath stinks (yeah)
you hope i choke on a pepsi (yep)
bitch, you was supposed to correct me (oh)
been textin' you since three, i still get no fucking reply
you say you sleep alone, but yet your mattress is king size
fuck you goin' in those knee-high boots? cut it out, bitch
i doubt that you're goin' to house sit
in that outfit, and those skin-tight levi's
every word that comes out your mouth's a fucking lie
oh, it's springtime, time for you to have a fling like a slingshot
you say don't come over 'cause you got pink eye
but i think i got just the thing
why don't i bring my fuckin' bat and just swing by?
