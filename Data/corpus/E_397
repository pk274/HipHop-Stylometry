i got 50 cent, i got g-unit
d-twizzy's in this bitch with obie trice (whoo!)
so watch what you say (uh-uh) before you call our name
if you say one more thing, it won't be nice


uh, here we go, i shoulda known
i was bound to get pulled into some bullshit sooner or later
you little haters are too jealous of us to love us
you hate it, g-unit made it
and obie's comin', d-twizzy's comin', you sick to your stomach
fifty percent is 50-cent, the other fifty percent is whose color skin it is
well if you're even considering takin' our label down
you better find our building and fly a fucking plane into it
but i ain't tryin' to get too intricate into it
i'm just tryin' to give you a little hint for your own benefit
'cause then it's gonna get to the point where it escalates
into some other shit, then i'ma flip
then i'ma get to stompin' in my err force one's
won't be able to tell if it's two purrs or it's one
it's gonna feel like there's so many feet kickin' you
you think that nike just made these into cleat tennis shoes
i don't know what it is or what it could be
but i get a woody when these pussy's try to push me
thinkin' they gon' put me in the position to pickle me
y'all tickle me pink, i think i'd just rather have p!nk tickle me
hickory-dickory-dock, tickety-tock-tickety
a little bit of the diggity-doc-diggity
mixed with a little bit of the jigga-jig-jigga
with a small pinch of biggie
look at me, i'm just the bomb-diggity


we the realest label
don't try to act like you don't feel our label
'cause we gon' fuck around and kill your label
obie, d-twizzy, g-unit, 50, shady records
we the label for sure
we the realest label
don't try to act like you don't feel our label
we gon' fuck around and steal your people
obie, d-twizzy, g-unit, 50
we gonna kill your fuckin' label for sure


shady in the place to be, see
and i got what it takes to rock the mic right
still watch what you say to me punk
'cause i'm off probation in less than six months


haha, whoo!

and don't think we don't hear you motherfuckers talking
'cause we do
we see y'all
but we just gonna sit back for a minute
and watch what the fuck yall do
