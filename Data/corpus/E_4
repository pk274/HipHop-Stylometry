what i wanna do? what i wanna do?
let me see right here, yo


not many people that i label would be able
to display table manners, but our plan is
to make this beat rock like scanners and make the fans just
go bananas, yo, get our planners
that means our nuts for the sluts who don't under-
stand this, yo, my plan is, yeah right
and y'all gon' stand there and act like you don't understand it
like my name is janet, my titty fell out and i ain't plan it
yo, check this—check this out
and if you rocking with ya necklace out, that's my breakfast now
i'mma snatch it, yo, my style is wretched
you can't fetch it, no you can't stretch it
and yo, it doesn't really matter
cause ya name i can't even pronunciate, you the—
same type of mo'fucker to go and sucker
punch dre at the vibe awards, but he right behind the boards
the next day, so kiss an ass
or kiss a dick, lick a dick, eat my ass
whatever you won' do it's on you
big proof coming through with the mo—


aftermath in the house now
get yo' fricking mouth stabbed out
y'all get so mad
get so livid
looking for dap from anyone who would give it
now how you gon' value
someone else's opinion
cause you selfish
i'm rap's elvis
everybody try to grab the helm-ets and they hardhats
run and duck for cover
yo, fuck ya mother
what the fuck are ya?
yo, i'm sprayin'
while i'm playin'
i ain't playin'
i'm sprayin' at your feet
like hey imma cock the hand
imma pull my cock out
outta my pajamas
and cock back the cock
like it's chicken
yo, check it out
the clock is ticking
it's countdown to armageddon
and there's nothing you can do to stop it
put your arm or head in
or put a pen in it
but once the grenade pin is pulled
it's nothing you could do
but end up in the hospital
yeah, yeah
hospital, pital, 'spitals
end up in the 'spital
and y'all can eat my tender vittles
i don't really give a fudge
fudge, fudge-packers
is what y'all are
and y'all get smacked up
at the awards show
however you want it to go
we can make it go either way
biatch
that's itch-bay backwards
f around and smack turds
they told us not to use no cuss words
so we gon' not use cuss words
and say busters instead
have you all bleeding red
damn, right out of yo' head
that's what i said
and my name ain't fred
my name ain't special ed
and it ain't my birthday
but proof can get on the mic in the worst way
and i don't even have to curse to say


acid rap
yeah and that's a fact
slim shady's back
got eighty ladies layin' on they back
yo, but i'm a mack
i'm a little nuts for brittany
little to sane for whitney
tell you the truth
yo, bobby would prolly get me
catch me in the lobby
after he just hit me
after he sniffed three lines
he'd prolly knock out fifty
he could prolly lift up both of us
and spin us both on both fingers like donuts
yo, i party hard
but for real, i want bobby brown as my bodyguard
and that's for real
and that's the deal
cause we got mass appeal
and i don't think that they can really take it
cause i always let my nuts hang
like i was doing push-ups naked
that's what i do
is drink the alizé and
then i pass it to my man proof and
then we start goofin' around
and start spoofin'
everybody, yo we in the party
and we could rock the party
and we could get it started
and if ya smell like (sniff)
somebody farted
or we can
we can do the mardi gardy
we could party harder
we could get started
what you wanna do
proof, it's on you


that's what's up
pass this cup
and then we blast you up
freestyle right off the massive truck
we got truckloads
and uff, no
cuff no and spin it backwards
and play it back later
cause all y'all haters rockin' gators
alligators, we see ya later
we ain't player haters
but yo check it out
we rockin' in our navigators
and we can sit back
and we can stretch, we can check
trek, i mean catch, anything
and we can fetch
i'm slurring a little bit
but during the part that i was doing
the urination, upon that girl and
wait a minute, i ain't goin'
there with my rap
i ain't tryin' to be starting no crap
but yo, i be flowin'
with the stuff and i be knowin'
that when i start raking out them leaves
i be hoein'
and that's six in the mornin'
and we can do it
we can get it on until the crack of dawn and
we can get it on with tim westwood
we can do whatever you want
bring ya best cause
we do what we want to do
on this microphone
cause we ought to know
or ought to inform you
that we get warm too warm
sometimes we too hot to
not to spit this ish
spit it backwards and that said shit
whoops, i didn't mean to curse
but yo proof, come back
and lay one verse


how you know the main side, so attraction
psycho action
the man 'ill throw up on michael jackson
sick enough to do anything
in any video
i could even pull out my whole titty yo
wouldn't mean a damn thing
wouldn't mean nothing
like if you went and pulled hamstring
cause you a fake 'iatch
i took the b off
cause imma be off with the switch
just like you
cause you walk with a switch too
that's what i meant
cause i represent, every single day
pass it off to stat


can't cuss it dog
take it dog
ayo, get with the
with the girl
better take it off
she got the bra better shake it y'all
ayo, check it out
i'm about to bull
and wreck it out


tim gon' make us freestyle forever
