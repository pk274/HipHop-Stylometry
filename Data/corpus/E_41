i probably got a screw loose or two
or maybe three or four of 'em
some fell out and hit the floor
all i know is ever since my fucking head hit the snowbank
i been a little neanderthalish, no thanks to my man d'angelo bailey
but i just take it slow daily, my biggest dilemma's
trying to figure whether to use the flat head or the phillips
or just go to the home depot and pick the new power drill up
it's been two hours and six days and i'm still up
i feel like i'm about to snap any minute
there's a new tower records about to stop and get a fill-up
pick the new cypress hill up
and go find who did that shit to xzibit
and go fill up a whole liquor bottle with piss
and shatter his fucking lips with it
