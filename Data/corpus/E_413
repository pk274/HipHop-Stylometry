what?
uh
the bad!
yeah
the evil!
the bad, the evil!
put 'em together...


yo, if it wasn't for your whip, i'd have nothing to strip
if it wasn't for a wrist, i'd have nothing to slit
if it wasn't for the shrooms, i'd have nothing to chew
i'm just fucking with you, 'cause i got nothing to do


i came in the diner with skateboarders and placed orders
ate hors d'œuvres and hit the waiter with plate warmers
let you inhale the glock smell while i'm ripping your wallet off
and slipping a molotov in your cocktail
burning your contracts, punch your a&r in the face
smash his glasses and turn 'em to contacts
i'm on some suge shit; if it's missing, i took it (whoops)
"nurse, look at this straitjacket; it's crooked"
i go to jail and murder you from a cell
put a knife in an envelope and have you stabbed in the mail (fedex)
so how do you describe someone with a decapitated head
when the rest of his body's still alive running?


yo, if it wasn't for your whip, i'd have nothing to strip
if it wasn't for a wrist, i'd have nothing to slit
if it wasn't for the shrooms, i'd have nothing to chew
i'm just fucking with you, 'cause i got nothing to do
yo, if it wasn't for your whip, i'd have nothing to strip

forget a chorus, my metaphors are so complicated
it takes six minutes to get applause (yay)
and by the time you all catch on, i'mma end your career
and walk away with the whole floor so you have nothing to fall back on
i'll throw you off of ten floors (ahhhhh!)
pull a fucking headache out of my head, and put it in yours (take this)
i'm indoors, waiting for this acid to seep in my skin pores
to go outdoors and do some in-stores
this bitch wanted to blow me, i said, "it oughta happen—
you swallow cum, bitch?" "no, but i brought a napkin"
getting skully while i'm autographing
got my daughter laughing 'cause i sent her mother whitewater rafting
i'm not a fact, i'm a proven fear
mr. rogers blocked up my u-haul screaming "you ain't moving here"
lorena bobbitt—c'mere, want a souvenir?
i've been high as fuck, since i was a juvi-neer
"juvenile?" same difference, i need some 'caine
'cause i ain't sniffed since i woke up to seven slain infants (oh, my god)
brain implants and they say there's a slim chance
i won't stay the same 'cause i traded brains with a chimpanz' (ohhh!)


yo, if it wasn't for your whip, i'd have nothing to strip
