my life is trapped in these lines, that’s why i’m packin' these nines
i gotta rap, i ain’t dyin', that’s in the back of my mind
got a strap made of iron, can’t relax on this grind
bendin' over backwards for these slackers 'til i’m snappin' my spine
natural high, gotta focus on these bogus poachers
lookin' over my shoulder, proof get it poppin' like soda
hold up, we nothin' but soldiers
slow up, this gun is loaded
roll up, they beef and we leavin' ‘em coked up!
if em say it, i spray it; if he will it, i kill it
we kilpatrick and ilitch of detroit, y'all can feel it
real as this gun on my waistline, at war we don’t waste time
ja, man he can’t take a punch and 50 can take nine (brrrah!)
we got schoolcraft here at the 7, 8, and dexter
i’m up in hollis spendin’ dollars, ain’t feelin' no pressure
yes sir, your texture is bitch, betcha you flinch
when proof shoot up that coup and wet your whole clique
fuck it, who's next on this shit? this is breathless to pits
when you brothers is stiff as slugs exit ya wig
you'll be next to b.i.g., 'pac, it's destiny kid
before ya lid get popped, stop testin' me, bitch! (what!)
