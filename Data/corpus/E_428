nah, we ain't done!


i love being hated, it's great, it lets me know that i made it
i wouldn't have it no other way, i wouldn't trade it for the world
only lets me know that i'm loved
by so many other motherfuckers that ain't you, and it's bugged
'cause you keep fucking with us, we keep fucking you up
and keep pulling the rug from up under you
and whatâ€™s even more fucked up, is we enjoy what we're doing
so much there ain't nothing that we love more than "pulling your skirts up"
and exposing you hoes so much, people are starting to wonder
what's up with them fucking wonder woman underoos?
do unto others as you will have done unto you
so who the fuck you motherfuckers gonna run to
when someone runs up with a mask and puts a gun to you?
you gon' ask yourself, how come your mans
didn't empty that last round that he had in curtis jackson's ass while he had the chance?
you keep asking us to keep it on wax but we can't
this is past any rationalization
we have captured national media attention
conversation is senseless, you can sense the tension start building
soon as we enter the 106 & park building
someone's gonna get killed and i swear to god
if someone so much as even touches one of my people
i'll put a million on his head
and you ain't got the funds to match or counteract it
but i'd rather rap than get into this gangsta shit
and it ain't because i'm a bitch
it's because i ain't a bitch, i don't endanger people that i'm with
i'm a general, i ain't bush, i don't send my soldiers to war
if i ain't there in the middle of the shit with 'em, so when i do get 'em
orders to storm your headquarters, you'll be fucking with a
