you've been patiently waitin' to make it through all the hatin'
debatin' whether or not you can even weather the storm
and as you lay on the table, they operatin' to save you
it's like an angel came to you, sent from the heavens above

they think they're crazy, but they ain't crazy, let's face it, shit, basically
they're just playin' sick, they ain't shit, they ain't sayin' shit, spray 'em, 50
a to the k, get in the way, i'll bring dre and them with me
and turn this day into fuckin' mayhem, you stayin' with me?
don't let me lose you, i'm not tryna confuse you
when i let loose with this uzi and just shoot through your isuzu
you get the message? am i gettin' through to you?
you know what's comin'? you motherfuckers don't even know, do you?
take some big and some pac and you mix 'em up in a pot
sprinkle a little big l on top, what the fuck do you got?
you got the realest and illest killers tied up in a knot
the juggernauts of this rap shit, like it or not
it's like a fight to the top just to see who'd die for the spot
you put your life in this, nothin' like survivin' a shot
y'all know what time it is, soon as 50 signs on this dot
shit, what you know about death threats? 'cause i get a lot
shady records was eighty seconds away from the towers
some cowards fucked with the wrong building, they meant to hit ours
better evacuate all children (woo), it's nuclear showers
there's nothin' spookier, you're now about to witness the power of fuckin' 50
