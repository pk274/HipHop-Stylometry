come to me now, you don't come to me now
apple in your mouth, tackled on the couch
shackled in the house, i'll be back in about
twenty minutes or less, with my hannibal mask
the way you wiggle around and giggle in that cage
i knew i couldn't wait to get you off that stage
from the moment i met you, had to let you know
i just wanted to get you through my bedroom do'
you makin' me feel like i'm in middle school still
you squeal like a little girl, you're pitiful, chill
we gon' fuck, i just popped this little blue pill
you can leave, but wait, i gotta shit on you still
i shouldn't have to say it, shorty, you should know
i hope you really gettin' into my creepshow
let me shit on your chest and if some pee comes out
just guzzle it down, just guzzle it down
