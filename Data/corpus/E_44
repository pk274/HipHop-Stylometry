alright, let's go
yeah! welcome... to the official... shade 45 anger management 3 exclusive mixtape. (get familiar!) brought to you by... none other then... the motherfuckin'... (*scratch*) fuckin' notorious, infamous, dj- (clinton sparks!) whoo!


once again it's the kid, yeah, eat a dick up
pick up them nuts boy, lick up 'til you hiccup
sick mo'fucka, yeah, same sick mug used to stick up
his middle finger and go chicka-chicka-chicka
hi! my name is chicka-chicka-chicka
chicka-chicka-chicka-chicka-chicka-chicka-chicka
'till this shit was stuck in your head so much
you were sick of him and chicks love him
and the more he said "fuck a bitch" they adored him
and he did the shit more; choke a slut, smack a bitch whore
beat a bitch up, look at these kids, they eat this shit up
and this was back before i even knew what the shit was
it's affecting what it does, parents become picketers
meanwhile ticket sales have just skyrocketed up
so shit, fuck, shit, fuck, shit, fuck, fuck you, suck a dick slut
but i gotta go, it's time for me to go and pick up
jessica, it's official i just broke her and nick up
