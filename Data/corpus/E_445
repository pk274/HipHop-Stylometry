the thought of retiring is makin' me want
to set your daughter on fire with a soldering iron and
what up ma, i'm applyin' for the rim job, are you hirin'?
i'm hopin' to fill up your openin'
oh but i know i gotta meet a lot of requirements
first i gotta accept you're in a lobby in ireland
and you've probably already been with all the slaughter and i am
in no mood to be playin' second fiddle, slob on this violin
with no strings attached
i'm just the product of a hostile environment
but bein' brought up so wrought up inspired
but i don't know why, it's still like i'm caught up inside a whirlpool
not an appliance, but applyin' this science, i psychotically rhyme
and it's like stars have aligned all in alliance
heart of a lion, balls of goliath
obscene talk intertwined like a beanstalk and a vine
but i keep walkin' the line between the wrong and the right
but everything i write seems wrong and it's like
i'm ecstatic at all the static that i can still cause
in the fabric of our modern society
now catholics are panicking 'cause i snapped back
to my old antics and shenanigans, dammit, the pope's mad again
probably shouldn't've ran up in the vatican with that mannequin
singin' "bagpipes from baghdad" again
in my dad's drag, draggin' a faggot in a glaad bag
won't be the last time i make a dramatic entrance like that again
you thought i was lyin' when i said i think that i'm crossin' the line again
i've lost my mind, caution oh god i think i just thought of another fucking line
forgive me father, for i have sinned
but hip-hop has left me brainwashed with a violent...streak
defiant, now the odds of me tryin' to fuckin' be quiet
probably gotta be 'bout as high as the jolly green giant
after he's fallen in pollen next to a killer beehive colony tryin' to sneak by it
while his feet stomp, follow me while i revive rap
i'ma start up a rioting, try to stop it or silence it
you're not gonna, might as well just hit the block in your joggin' attire in
boston, across the marathon finish line than to
put your thoughts against mine
'cause the arsenal i have'll scar you for life, worse than dzhokhar
tsarnaev with bombs, pliers and barbed wire
your bars are like barney fife with a fucking swiss army knife
a saberless darth vader with arthritis in a bar fight
with the dark knight on a dark night with his arms tied up
i'm dahmer-like when i'm on the mic, i'm not gonna lie
perform like i'm gonna die at the end of a song so it's hard for the rhyme to end
like fuck 'em all i'm just ridin'
like i'm locked up inside of a shot up bonnie and clyde car
uncle ronnie was driving, 'bout to burst through the side door
of arkham asylum and park in the dining room
