i'm the rawest, uh, rest of y'all just one of a
i’m becoming what i used to make fun of, a
smug son of a bitch, fuck it though
going for the fucking jugular
leave them in a puddle of blood i’m a
killer, but i'm a cut above the others
bloody glove in a prison yard, jodi arias
i’m coming for you, fuck if the world doesn’t approve
here i come as a custodian i'm dressed, to smuggle ya
ass out wrapped up in a comforter come snuggle up with
another fucking nut, we’ll make a tub of truffle butter
i’ma take this chubby, shove it up that nice round little bubble butt
make it double-stuffed
pull it out one hole, put it in the other one
make a peanut butter cup, bust (yeah)
we can fuck on a golf cart
tell me how you want it, soft, hard, or fucking rough
like a dog bark, stop at a walmart
get a couple of 50 watt bulbs with a hot tub
fill up them buns with a hot dog
to be frank these other motherfuckers ain’t even in the ball park
then she pulled out the condiment drawer
she must heard this is where the condoms get stored
sign above the door to the sauna says
“welcome to sodom and gomorrah”
told her i got something for her
sharp and it’s pointed
and it’s head’s on swole, hold it like a samurai
she said, “woah, look at that bulge, must have a huge ego”
i said, “is it me you’re aiming that compliment toward?”
she said, “yes, my ninja, please get to stabbing this shit”
i commenced to dropping them drawers
threw my black belt and gauntlets all onto the floor
zipped down my fly, whipped out my confident sword
