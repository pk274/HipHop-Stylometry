i can still remember (what?) tryna shop a deal (uh-huh)
from taco bell to trl
i climbed the billboard charts to the top until
as fate would have it (yeah), became an addict
funny 'cause i had pop appeal
but they said time would tell (what?) if i'd prevail (huh?)
and all i did was (what?) put nine-inch nails (where?)
in my eyelids now (what?)
i'm seein' diamond sales like i'm in zales (yeah)
without a doubt, by any means
if rap was skinny jeans, i couldn't do anything in 'em
i'd be splitting seams of denim when i'm spitting schemes
which really means, no "if," "ands," or "buts" are squeezin' in between
you sleep on me 'cause you're only fuckin' with me in your dreams
not even when i'm on my deathbed
man, i feel like ed, it isn't time to drop the mic yet
so why would i quit?
the thought that i would stop when i'm dead
just popped in my head
i said it, then forgot what i said


it isn't my time to call it a day
i got rap locked and i'm already paid
but it's 'bout time you remember the name
ayy, ayy
you know it ain't my time to call it a day
i got rap locked and i'm already paid
but it's 'bout time you remember the name
ayy, ayy


you know it ain't my time to call it a day
i got rap locked and i'm already paid
and it's about time you remember the name
ayy, ayy
you know it ain't my time to call it a day
i got rap locked and i'm already paid
but it's 'bout time you remember the name
ayy, ayy
(hey, hey, hey)
