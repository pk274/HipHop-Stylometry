i don't wanna go to school, i don't need no education!
(we don't need no education)
i don't wanna be like you, i don't wanna save the nation! (daddy, no!)
i just wanna live my life, every day a celebration!
(we don't need no thought control)
one day, i'ma leave this world, i'm waiting for the revelation!


i've been praised and labeled as crazed
my mother was unable to raise me, full of crazy rage
an angry teenager, nothing can change me back
gangsta rap made me act like a maniac
i was boosting, so influenced by music i used it
as an excuse to do shit, ooh, i was stupid
no one can tell me nothing hip-hop overwhelmed me
to the point where it had me in a whole 'nother realm
it was like isolating myself was healthy
it felt like we was on welfare but wealthy
compelled me to excel when school had failed me
expelled me and when the principal would tell me
i was nothing, and i wouldn't amount to shit
i made my first million and counted it
now look at, a fucking drop-out that quit
stupid as shit, rich as fuck, and proud of it
that's why


i don't wanna go to school, i don't need no education!
(we don't need no education)
i don't wanna be like you, i don't wanna save the nation! (daddy, no!)
i just wanna live my life, everyday a celebration!
(i don't need no self control)
one day, i'ma leave this world, i'm waiting for the revelation!
