i ain't into s&m, but my whip's off the chain
a little drop of candy paint drips off the frame
twisted-ass mind, got a pretzel for a brain
an eraser for a head, fuckin' pencil for a frame
you don't like it, then peel off, bitch
every last woman on earth i'll kill off
and i still wouldn't fuck you, slut
so wipe the smile on your grill off
i swear to god i'll piss a happy meal off
get the wheels turning, spin, and wheel off
snap the axle in half, bust the tie-rod
quit hollering, "why, god?"
he ain't got shit to do with it
bygones'll never be bygones
the world ain't finished swallowing my wad
i ain't finished blowing it, nice bra
hope it'll fit a tough titty, bitch, life's hard
i swear to god life is a dumb blonde white broad
with fake tits and a bad dye job
who just spit in my fuckin' face and called me a fuckin' tightwad
so finally i broke down and bought her an ipod
and caught her stealing my music
so i tied her arms and legs to the bed
set up the camera and pissed twice on her
look, two pees and a tripod
the moral to the story is life's treating you like dry sod?
kick it back in its face, my god
it's shady and nicki minaj, you might find the sight quite odd
but don't ask why, bitch, ask why not?
the world-world is my punching bag and
if i'm garbage, you're a bunch of maggots
make that face, go on, scrunch it up at me
show me the target so i can lunge and attack it
like a, rah, rah, like a dungeon dragon
you fell off, off, they must've bumped your wagon
you must've went off the back, i'm 'bout to go off the deep end
told you to stay in your lane, you just jumped in traffic


all you lil' faggots can suck it
no homo, but i'ma stick it to 'em like refrigerator magnets
and i'm crooked enough to make straitjackets bend
yeah, look who's back again, bitch, keep acting as if
you have the same passion i have, yeah, right
still hungry, my ass, you ass-dicks had gastric bypass
ain't hot enough to set fire to dry grass
and 'bout as violent as hair on eyelids, but eyelash
go take a flying leap of faith off a fuckin' balcony
'fore i shove a falcon wing up your fly ass
you know what time it is, so why ask?
when shady and nicki's worlds clash
it's high class meets white trash
