i hit you bastards raps fast as janet jackson's coochie
your raps is half mastered, mad average, wack booty
and if you ever wanna get a deal
you should either od off skill pills or steal my reel-to-reels (here, look!)
most of y'all emcees ain't tight as y'all should be when
i'm tighter than the jeans that show hoochie chicks' coochie prints
outsidaz, we hot as hell's flames is
and i'm slang-iz, my tapes get pumped like twelve gauges


i'm so weeded (how weeded are you?)
i'm so weeded, i can freestyle for sixteen bars (ha ha ha)
right off the top, then go back to the top and then repeat it (ha)
write it down on the paper and still be able to read it (sorry)
i can't read, but i still write to my pen pals (uh, uh, dear)
i can't fly, but i still float on cement clouds (whee!)
i can't see cause my eyes already been gouged
out; i been down with the outz for ten thou-
sand years (so dunn, here?)
to the weird kids with piercings in more than one ear
lauryn, huh? hill? (there's more than one, ill!)
what? you want me to stop? here?
