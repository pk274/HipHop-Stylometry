i was sittin' in my house, cold writin' some beats
when i got hit in the head with a big pair of cleats
i turned around and said "what the fuck is goin' on?"
next thing i knew the shit threw me on my front lawn
i jumped up and i was laying in the snow
then i looked up, and it came crashing out my window
i couldn't figure out what the hell it was
but it was flying so high it gave me a buzz
i said "damn", and then they came swinging down
from a big tree and it had a mean frown
it had a mean grin on it's chin and i began
to ran down the street because i was in fear
of this thing that was comin' after me
and all i could hear was a goddamn catastrophe
the sound of it, just made me cry
i said "oh my god, where's my mom, i think i'm gonna die"
i said "shit" then i continued running
down the block, i turned around and the shit was still comin'
then i tripped and fell in a pile of dog shit
i say "goddamn, i think i've just been hit by something"
but i still couldn't figure out what the hell it was
then it turned around and grabbed my nuts
i said "what the fuck is going on?"
then it threw me out again and i ended up on my front lawn
i turned around and heard the sound of nothing
'cause nothing was there, i said "shit, it must be bluffing"
i didn't see anything but i felt a smack
it hit me in my head and i landed on my back
but i still didn't see anything
i was looking around and there still was nothing
i said "damn, i gotta get in my house"
and then i asked charlie, charlie's my mouse
i said "charlie, what the hell should i do?"
he said "grab a wig, and put it on and then take a poo
in your house, go take a shit in your toilet
that's the only thing that will foil it
its plan, to overrule the kingdom"
i said "i gotta bring some
big turds, when i land them in the toilet
so james take the mic
and talk about what happened that mysterious night"


put the beat back on the track so i can
bust a funky rhyme again
well the next thing i...
no... no... no... no
