what's your favorite scary movie?
yo, slim shady (yo, royce 5'9")
y'all wanna make a movie? (what, what?)
we got the film right here


y'all want drama? wanna make a scary movie?
rappers comin' in with their team and carry toolies
you can jump right out of the screen and barely move me
we hard-hittin', directin' and starrin' in it

the one man on the planet that'll drive off of the grand canyon
hop out of a grand am and land in it handstandin'
any man plannin' to battle'll get snatched outta his clothes
so fast it'll look like an invisible man standin'
i'm headed for hell, i'd rather be dead or in jail
bill clinton, hit this — and you better inhale!
‘cause any mc that chooses to go against me
is gettin' taken advantage of, like monica lewinsky (leave me alone!)
came home in a frenzy, pushin' a ten speed
screamin' to aunt peg
with three spokes stickin' outta my pant leg
fuck a headache! give me a migraine, damn it, i like pain
you should be anywhere that a mic ain't
you rap knowin' you wack
you act up and i'm throwin' you down a flight of steps
then i'm throwin' you back up them
if they don't like the track, fuck 'em! the rap struck 'em
harder than gettin' hit by a mack truck and then backed up on
and any half-assed known rapper to trespass
better be ready for the second celebrity deathmatch
so tell the medic to bring the medication and quickly
i'm sicker than a 2pac dedication to biggie
i'm free-fallin' feet first out of a damn tree
to stampede your chest 'til you can't breathe
and when i'm down to my last breath
i'ma climb the empire state building
and get to the last step and still have half left

bad, the bad (uhh, when the bad meets the bad, yo)
the evil (take the evil with the evil)
put 'em together (what? nine-nine)
