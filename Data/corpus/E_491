i'm reminiscin' on your tenderness and the snugglin' and teasin'
missin' what i remember kissin' and huggin' and squeezin'
buggin' and wheezin', i'm havin' trouble when breathin'
it's even tougher when sleepin'
but there's a couple of reasons that i'm sufferin' and grievin'
for lovin' and leavin'
you're all i'm thinkin' of in the evenin'
you got my knees bucklin' and weakenin'
thoughts of nothin' but freakin'
that i'm strugglin' to keep in
interrupt when i'm speakin'
i got some game that i'm preparin' to run (*laughter*)
the way your lips sparkle, and they glare in the sun
you got your hair in a bun
no matter what you're wearin', you stun
'cause you're comparin' to none
i want to share in the fun, i feel a passionate lust
when i imagine it just alone at last when it's us
i see you graspin' to trust
but my intentions are good, let's leave the past in the dust
i'm not askin' to rush and answer me immediately
i just wanna be there for you and you to be there for me
if you agree, then repeat after me
"i love you" (i love you, baby)
'cause i just need you to see
how much i'm eager to be your man legally wed
your love's keepin' me fed
this is easily said, so you can lead or be led
if you care to be down
'cause ain't nobody like you, nowhere to be found
