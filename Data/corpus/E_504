woo! shady, aftermath
look at that bitch
oh, shit, hey (damn)


there she go, shakin' that ass on the flo'
bumpin' and grindin' that pole
the way she's grindin' that pole
i think i'm losin' control


get buzzed, get drunk, get crunk
get fucked up, hit the strip club
don't forget ones, get your dick rubbed, get fucked
get sucked, get wasted, shit-faceted
pasted, plastered – puke, drink, throw up
get a new drink, hit the bathroom sink, throw up
wipe your shoe clean, got a routine goin'
still got a few chunks on them shoestrings showin'
i was dehydrated 'til the beat vibrated
i was revived as soon as this bitch gyrated
them hips and licked them lips, and that was it
i had to get nate dogg here to sing some shit


i'm a menace, a dentist, an oral hygienist
open your mouth for about four or five minutes
take a little bit of this fluoride rin-inse
swish, but don't spit it; swallow it and now finish, yeah
me and nate d-o-double-g
lookin' for a couple bitches with some double d's
pop a little champagne and a couple e's

we 'bout to have a party (turn the music up)
let's get it started (go 'head and shake your butt)
i'm lookin' fo' a girl i can fuck in my hummer truck
apple bottom jeans and a big ol' butt
some girls, they act retarded (man, i told you–)
some girls are 'bout it, 'bout it
i want a bitch to sit at the crib with no panties on
knows that she can, but she won't say no
(now) look at this lady all in front of me
sexy as can be, tonight, i want a slut
would you be mine?
heard you was freaky from a friend of mine
now, i hope you don't get mad at me
but i told nate you was a freak, he said he wants a slut
hope you don't mind
i told him how you like it from behind


there she go, shakin' that ass on the flo'
bumpin' and grindin' that pole
the way she's grindin' that pole
i think i'm losin' control

and my boy, and his boy
