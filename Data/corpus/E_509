mhmmm *inhales*
you high, baby?
yeah, hahahaha
yeah?
talk to me
you want me to tell you somethin'?
uh-huh
i know what you wanna hear


they call me superman
leap tall hoes in a single bound
i'm single now: got no ring on this finger now
i'd never let another chick bring me down
in a relationship, save it, bitch
babysit? you make me sick
superman ain't savin' shit
girl, you can jump on shady's dick
straight from the hip, cut to the chase
i tell a muhfuckin' slut to her face
play no games, say no names
ever since i broke up with what's-her-face
i'm a different man, kiss my ass
kiss my lips? bitch, why ask?
kiss my dick, get my cash?
i'd rather have you whip my ass
don't put out? i'll put you out
won't get out? i'll push you out
puss blew out, poppin' shit
wouldn't piss on fire to put you out
am i too nice? buy you ice?
bitch, if you died, wouldn't buy you life
what, you tryina be my new wife?
what, you mariah? fly through twice


but i do know one thing though
bitches, they come, they go
saturday through sunday, monday (ahhh)
monday through sunday, yo
maybe i'll love you one day
maybe we'll someday grow
'til then just sit your drunk ass on that fuckin' runway, ho


yeah, we fuckedâ€”bitch, so what?
that's about as far as your buddy goes
we'll be friends, i'll call you again
i'll chase you around every bar you attend
never know what kinda car i'll be in
we'll see how much you'll be partyin' then
you don't want that, neither do i
i don't wanna flip when i see you with guys
too much pride, between you and i
not a jealous man, but females lie
but i guess that's just what's-what's do
how could it ever be just us two?
i'd never love you enough to trust you
we just met and i just fucked you


but i do know one thing though
bitches, they come, they go
saturday through sunday, monday
monday through sunday, yo
maybe i'll love you one day
maybe we'll someday grow
'til then just sit your drunk ass on that fuckin' runway, ho
