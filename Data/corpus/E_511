i sat back in the chair rasping
barely able to breathe gasping at air grasping the bare aspirin
saying a prayer askin' the lord to forgive while i'm tumbling down the stairs crashing
when a bunch of people stand around starin' laughing
thinkin' i'm joking, dawg i'm choking
all of y'all can kiss my bare
