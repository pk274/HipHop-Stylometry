shady
konvict, upfront
akon, slim shady
i see the one
could she be that lady?
ayy


oh, looks like another club banger
they better hang on when they throw this thang on
get a little drink on, they gon' flip
for this akon shit, you can bank on it
pedicure, manicure, kitty-cat claws
the way she climbs up and down them poles
lookin' like one of them putty-cat dolls
tryin' to hold my woodie back through my drawers
steps off stage, didn't think i saw her
creeps up behind me, and she's like "you'reâ€”"
i'm like, "i know, let's cut to the chase
no time to waste, back to my place"
plus from the club to the crib's like a mile away
or more like a palace, shall i say
and plus, i got a pal if your gal is game
in fact, he's the one singin' the song that's playin' (akon!)
