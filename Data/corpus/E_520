i bet you that i got something you ain't got
(everywhere i see, a soldier, a soldier)
that's called courage
(everywhere i see, a soldier like me)
it don't come from no liquor bottle
(everywhere i see, a soldier, a soldier)
it ain't scotch, it's not bourbon
(everywhere i see, a soldier like me)
i don't walk around like no g
(everywhere i see, a soldier, a soldier)
‘cause that ain't me, i'm not that person
(everywhere i see, a soldier like me)
i don't try to act like you do
(everywhere i see, a soldier, a soldier)
‘cause that ain't you, you just frontin', you ain't?
(everywhere i see, a soldier like me)
