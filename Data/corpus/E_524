wait! 'fore i wreck this beat, let me just check to see
if stephanie mills left any extra refills
of ecstasy pills next to me, in the seats spilled
or she eat 'em all with a breakfast drink (you inspect the sink?)
i'm in the habit of grabbin' a mic and babblin', i dabble in vics
but i might just swallow my fuckin' ritalin tablet after tonight
i'm grabbin' it right from the medicine cabinet
'cause that's what it's like, and attackin' it like a dracula bite
jetpack in a backpack when i write
all this anger pent-up inside
i went up inside a bennigans diner with a cigarette lighter
figured i'd try to set a big enough fire
that'll trigger the sprinkler system
and i'd escape, but the getaway driver
screwed up my limo, collided with the center divider
i went through the window and ended up being pinned to the side
of a semi fender beside a friend of the guy's wife brenda
the flight attendant from idaho
that took an antenna in the vagina hole
'cause when i pick up a pen i'm venomous
and i'm as slick as dennis the menace
like an evil dental hygienist, sinister
you've been yellin' dementedness
i invented this, i'm the genesis
eminem is a nemesis to a feminist
fuckin' smart alec degenerate, i got ellen degeneres
tryna tell me these men are just full of jealousy, envious
of female independence, hell with a clitoris, hit or miss
you will never consider this a bitter disappointment
i'll never fail to deliver this
whatever the weather in this'll be
just like a certificate of authenticity that i'm thinkin' about
just tryna think of the quickest and sickest way
to make 'em picket, i pick a day to be a prick
then i'm pickin' the wickedest shit to say
spit it back on a level, incredible
head full of red bull, unforgettable
better believe these beats are edible
i consider loose leaf a vegetable
and i stalk my prey
you think you got away? uh-uh, not today
murder you on a song and then i'll just say
i was with dr. dre and robert blake, eatin' lobster, steak
and coffee cake at a restaurant with drake
and tech just gotta make sure that our stories corroborate
i'm a lot to take, like kanye walkin' up on the stage
for beyoncé, like it's my job to say
that you're not a real artist, but it's my obligation
honest abe is on his way, you will not escape
ammunition replenished, the punisher
with his gun insured, hundred words
in a clip, other words motherfuckers better run
if you're not lookin' to get run over by the roadrunner
no wonder no one don't wanna go
and jump in front of a fuckin' runaway locomotive
or get thrown up under it just tryna fuck with the—
