if there's any bitches in this room
then there's somethin' i gotta say
for all the fools who fell for the first girl who comes their way
i've been down that road
and now i'm back, sittin' on square one
tryin' to pick myself up where i started from


spend some time with me, say that you'll be mine (ha-ha)
i never thought i'd find someone to be mine
lord knows i was right, ‘cause you just crossed the line
spend some time with me, say that you'll be mine


i used to say i never met a girl like you before
still ain't got a fuckin' clue as to who you truly are
almost went as far as introducin' you to my daughters
'til you went as far as goin' and snoopin' through my drawers
now i just feel stupid for the loop that you threw me for
can't believe i almost flew the coop for some stupid whore
you used to say all you wanted was for me to be yours
all i ever wanted from you was a few booty calls
if you recall, i used to treat you like a groupie broad
when we fucked, i refused to even take my jewelry off
but it threw me off the first time i called and you blew me off
it was a shock, it struck me as odd, but it turned me on
you started gettin' moody on me, pretty soon we'd argue
and the ruder you got, the more beautiful you got to me
and who'da even knew that? who would'a even thought possibly
cupid could shoot another one of them goddamn darts at me?
it's true that i got shot in the heart
but when someone seems too good to be true, they usually are
but see, when you're in it, it's too hard to see
'til you pull up and see some other dude's car parked and reach
up under the seat as your heart starts to beat
before you make a decision that's life-altering
and just as you halt and you turn and you start to leave
you hear them words echoing, almost haunting, that taunting ring


spend some time with me, say that you'll be mine (ha-ha)
i never thought i'd find someone to be mine
lord knows i was right, ‘cause you just crossed the line
spend some time with me, say that you'll be mine (ha-ha)


spend some time with me, say that you'll be mine
i never thought i'd find someone to be mine
lord knows i was right, ‘cause you just crossed the line
