i live in a bubble, i struggle with the fame
trouble is the pain grows double, give a fuck what you say
when my music you take so subtle, just to give it away
to people who don't even appreciate flows, mothafucka
i'm livid today, 'cause i break my back to give you my art
you steal my thoughts, it's like drivin' a spike through my heart
you might not think it's that big of a deal
to steal from me, but music's all i got
aside from my daughters, not to sound like a martyr
but it's getting harder than i thought
to not just go crazy, trapped in this house
i'm about to just snap
am i not deserving of what i got, did i not work for it?
put it all in every record i record, well then
please tell me why on this earth, lord's it keep happening?
i keep rappin', but i wonder sometimes, is it worth all the bullshit?
'cause it feels like a down there ainâ€™t no gettin' up from
but i won't let it get me down, i won't succumb
i'm anything but glum, so fuck 'em
they'll appreciate me when i'm gone, they'll say it was ill, right?
the way i killed mics? but the way i feel right now
it just feels like i'm so done with this shit that i may as well wipe
i have nothing else to give you, nothing left to contribute
farewell, i bid you, but before i go, my last gift to you
ladies and gentlemen, slaughterhouse, i give you
