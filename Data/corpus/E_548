yeah! eminem!
dirty dozen! yeah!


i’m in the sound-proof booth without a roof
drunk off 180-proof vodka with dr. ruth (what!)
we in the vocal room inhaling magic markers
sitting in the dark lighting our blunts with sparklers
we got my man pacewon behind the boards
cause we tied the engineer up with output cords (outsidaz, what!)
bizarre’s in the lobby with the beatles, smoking bowls
poking holes in his veins with dirty needles
we get all doped up from popping uppers
and run a train on foxy brown without rubbers (uh, uh-huh, yeah)
smoking homegrown drugs
that’s why you can barely tell what the fuck we’re saying, like bone-thugs (uh!)
hitting blunts ’til my lungs contort, smoke
then take one more short toke before i snort coke (what!)
shit, i been doing lines all day (what!)
my mind’s all clay from smelling pine-sol spray (what!)
what! no, hold up, hold up, hold up (hold up!)
smoking laced weed wrapped up in a fruit roll-up
my lungs are all swole-up and ‘bout to bust open
i’m just hoping i don’t die from snorting crushed motrin


i need drugs, somebody fix me
when i die, i’ma try to take the whole world with me (me!)
twelve blunts, plus i’m bringing your girl with me
when i die, i’ma try to take the whole world with me
i’m not coming back, so don’t send no one to get me
when i die, i’ma try to take the whole world with me (gimme dat)
fuck that, give me all my shit free
when i die, i’ma try to take the whole world with me
