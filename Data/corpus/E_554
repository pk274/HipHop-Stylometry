nowadays, everybody just wanna poke they nose
up in our business, what is this, some kind of joke?
man, everywhere i go, all i'm hearin' is mo' talk
"what's up with jada and fat joe? doin' a song with ol' boy on the song new york?
man, i thought you just went and did a song with 'em both?
man, the streets wanna know how you gonna go and diss michael?
you should get your ghetto pass revoked"
i ain't never had no ghetto pass, you asshole, you really wanna know
when i did live in the ghetto, i kept a trespassing charge up at the railroad tracks
so i suggest you get your facts straight 'fore you go, this assuming to know
i ain't grow up in no trailer park just cause i was poor
man, this is my testimo-ny, now those that don't know
me or feel like they do and feel to feel compelled to go and speak on me too
so, this dick goes to you and this dick goes to you
and if you feel like you want it, then you can get it too
and when you're through, pass it to the person next to you
ayo, stat, get on the mic and come and spit a few
