you're starin' straight into a barrel of hate, terrible fate
not even a slim chance to make a narrow escape
cupid shot his arrow and missed–wait, sarah, you're late
your train left, mascara and eggs smear in your face
night's over, goodbye, ho, i thought that i told ya
that spilled nut ain't nothin' to cry over
never shoulda came within range of my rover
shoulda known i was trouble soon as i rolled up
any chick who's dumb enough after i blindfold her
to still come back to the crib
must want me to mess with her mind, hold up
she mistook me for some high roller when i won't buy a soda
unless it's rock and rye cola (faygo's cheaper)
buy you a bag of fritos?
i wouldn't let you eat the fucking chip on my shoulder
if you was bleach and i was hair i wouldn't dye for ya
tryna pull five bucks from me is like tryna pull five molars
you'll get your eyes swolled up, i'm on my straight grizzly
so why would i buy you a gay-ass teddy bear?
bitch, you're already bi-polar


now i don’t really care what you call me
you can even call me cold
these bitches knew as soon as they saw me
it's never me they'll get the privilege to know
i roll like a desperado
now i never know where i’m gonna go
still, i ball like there’s no tomorrow
until it's over and that's all she wrote


yeah, i guess life is a bitch, ain't it, tip?
and each one thinks they the shit
shirt off my back? i wouldn’t give you the dirt off my handkerchief
i’m givin' these hoes a dose of their own medicine
let 'em get a good taste of it
i’m sure you got that relationship memo by now, but in case you didn't
i'ma stick this whole pad full of sticky notes to your forehead and staple it
life is too short and i got no time to sit around just wastin' it
so, i pace this shit a little bit quicker, that clock i'm racin' it, double timin' it
but i still spit triple the amount of insults in a tenth of the time that it may take you pricks to catch on
while you strong arm, i'm like stretch armstrong
man, i still say "k-mart's" like there's an apostrophe "s" on it, dog
and they say mcdonald's isn’t a restaurant, well i guess i’m wrong
but if you're gonna tell me that a&w ain't the spot for the best hot dogs, you can get the f on, dawg!


now i don’t really care what you call me
you can even call me cold
i bet they knew as soon as they saw me
goodnight, it’s over with, that's all she wrote
i roll like a desperado
now i never know where i’m gonna go
but still i ball like there’s no tomorrow
goodnight, it’s over with/and that's all she wrote


all she wrote, all she wrote
i said, it’s over with, that's all she wrote
all she wrote, all she wrote (yeah)
goodnight, it's over with, that's all she wrote
