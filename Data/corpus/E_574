if you open your ears long enough to listen you may hear what you been missin' out all of this time
i been put in position to put all this in position so quit your bitchin', learn how to rhyme, get signed and get your shine

welcome to statlanta
shady/aftermath and uh
a brand new rapper from atlanta who goes by the name of stat quo
introducin' our new excuse to keep producin', continue to do music, use it and expand it and make rap grow
the hottest new shit on a planet on a new plateau
but don't confuse it, you don't understand it, let me break it down for you to show you how we do shit so that you cats know
this is statlanta 101 cause we don't want no one walkin' out this motherfucker with tunnel vision
so, anyone with questions you want answered just ask 'em, we'll try to unmask 'em and maybe explain why so few cats blow
just spit the truth when you get in this booth and do that, though
that there boy, he hot to death, you already knew that, though
is he the greatest from the atl? we got haters all day to debate us
so we'll just say this: he's one you wouldn't want to tackle
