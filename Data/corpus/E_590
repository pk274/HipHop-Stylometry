there’s no need to say shit, you already know
the question is just how far will this go?
how far will he take it?
and when will he stop?
shady man, i done told you once homie to ease up
but you just won’t listen will ya? nah, i guess not
you just can’t can ya? man, i can’t stand ya
you’re rotten, what you plottin’ for us?
man, when are you gonna let up?
i guess things are gonna get much worse ‘fore they get better

holy toledo, it’s angelina jolie, amigo
she told me "yo, shady just hand your penis to me, i’ll deep throat,"
and brad if you try to stand between us then we’re gonna see, bro
who was a fantasy, i don’t mean to damage your ego
you faggots wanna 'rassle?
i shove a fucking jar of vaseline up inside your asshole
and rope it shut with a lasso
couple of crushed lexapro broken up with the capsule or paxil
just in case i ain't dope enough with the raps, though
coke is cut with tobacco, smoke it up, then go wacko
this is what happens when you mix a coconut with tabasco
shady let go, the ho has been choked enough, let her ass go
not till jessica simpson lets go of the tuna casserole
'cause i used to love her hooters now carmen electra's cuter
strap an extension cord to her arm and electrocute her
i’m off my fucking meds, but i’m on an electric scooter
i might just scoot by and shoot my mom in the neck with rugers
spit in jason's face while i vomit on freddy krueger
they can’t even get jeffrey dahmer to pet the cougar
now i’m gone get the rectal thermometer, get the lubra-
cation and get the patient some darvocet to chew 'cause...

b.o.b i done told you once homie to easy up, jeez
there’s no need to say shit you already know
the question is just how far will this go

oh my gosh i put natasha bedingfield in a washer
watch it go from rinse to spin cycle
it's like i got ya hypnotized and i forgot ya
my god, ya psychologically fucked
michael would like an apology, what?
tell that psycho to stick a tyco truck and a white tricycle up his butt
and glue the seat of bicycle to his nuts
i’m as cold as a muthafucking icicle i'm a nut
i ain't nuttin’ nice, man i like to pull knives and i like to cut
the poster addict for post traumatic stress
i guess this is the most dramatic i’ve been in a while
this is the closest that it's come to the marshall mathers
i can hear him start to gather
i don’t paint the portrait of the picture perfect partridge family
this ain't your orphan annie, no this is more uncanny
kick down dakota fanning's front door while the whore is tanning
(he can’t say whore) of course he can, man he just saw her fanny
then murdered her while he danced around the room and wore her panties
