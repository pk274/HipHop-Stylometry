my motto is live by the bottle
so why is my supply low, bring in a truckload with a high-low
stay grounded but i still reach for the sky though
ghetto idol i think, but what do i know
shit i know a lot more than i should
the hood stood by me just like i thought it would
don't act like i'm hollywood when i probably could
i don't polly, muhammad ali of rap, i don't lolly gag
west coast, the home of the body-bag
the shotty, the mag los angeles, where the party at
you can catch me anywhere where there's bacardi at
yeah, andre is back so have a cardiac
started back with the black raiders starter cap
gangsta rap, we practically fuckin' started that
everyday with this game i'm gettin' smarter at
sky's the limit so everytime i get on a track
