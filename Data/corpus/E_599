touchdown, on a private plane, gettin' brain 'til we

welcome to the midwest, yes, where them detroit playas ball
like you have no idea, the boy is here
got the whole place looking like it's candy painted
ain't it like we left the kids at home
and just let 'em loose with the crayons?
fuck, i just hit a jogger, people lookin' like frogger
they hoppin' out of the way
whenever they see marshall's car comin'
the kids painted my windows with black permanent marker
and let the rest of the car carpet color like swirl pops
and i got the bass thumpin'
but i'm bound to bump into somethin'
kids are flyin' through the air lookin' like they krumpin'
the way they tumblin', i gotta do somethin'
but as soon as i hit the car wash to get the tar off
they just right back at it tomorrow
they're like, "dad, this is in, so you're with the trends."
"this is for the pimps
listening to mims, nail polish on the rims."
and now it's custom chrome, but i gotta go do a show
so go on with your bad self, just have it back to normal
