slim, shady, through the mic kid, uh
slim shady, oh


i don't do black music, i don't do white music
i make fight music, for high school kids
i put lives at risk when i drive like this
from a slip disk from a limp bizkit disk
i just missed the gift list for christmas gifts
so i get pissed and can't pick which wrist to slit
little rich kids in cribs don't attempt this shit
so step back while i prep up to pimp this bitch
so i say to the girl, i'm like, "what up, girl? shut up, girl!"
then i showed her a cut up squirrel
she screamed "bloody murder" so loud everybody heard her
she slapped me in the mouth and called me a nutty murderer
i moved on to two blondes kissin' on a futon
"yo, baby, what are you on?"
i looked at 'em both and i was like, "look
check this out, toots, i'm lookin' for cookie puss
i need to speak to him immediately
they played my video on mtv last week"
and just when i was thinking i was all that and then some
here comes fred durst, "now shady, let me get some"


turn me loose
you better tell them to come reshingle the roof
‘cause just keep giving me free drinks 'til i puke
then fred will ask me to lead sing in his group
i'm sitting at the bar and i'm not being approached
‘cause fred's over there stealing all of my hoes
"yo, fred, save me some"
i walked to these siamese twins
and asked to have a threesome
i told them two heads are better than one
plus i respect how y'all roll together as one
got a slap in the teeth and a kick in the groin
stood up, like, "wait, where are you goin'?!"
well, three strikes and i'm out
and i just struck out two times in a row (ow!)
i ain't trying no more, fuck it, i'm chillin'
did a shot of jäger, fell asleep on the ceiling
