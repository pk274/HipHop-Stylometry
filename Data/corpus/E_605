here i go, lyrical
i have no idea what i'm doin' but i'm spiritual
on the microphone i tear you up in stereo
i'm like the grand wizard, yes, i'm the imperial
i have no fuckin' clue what the fuck i'm doin'
but "freifick, muschi", your whole life is ruined
if you try to step to me your life's in jeopardy
'cause i will seek you out wit'


yes, here we go – break it down
i got the crown, i'm 'bout to take it now
yo, i got my man and he's on the guitar
and when it comes to lyrics i go so far
like a car that i'm drivin', survivin' of vivarin
i'm alive, i'm like eye of the tiger
and i kick it so, so, fuckin' hard
now "freifick, muschi", don't diss me – regard it, come on!
