slim motherfuckin' shady
a'ight
missy elliott, timbo, c'mon, yo


i'm homicidal and suicidal, with no friends
holding a gun with no handles, just a barrel at both ends
sprayin' tecs at you until you see your fuckin' legs
with the bullet holes and the exit wounds layin' next to you
fuckin' mad dog, foamin' at the mouth
fuck mouth, my whole house is foamin' at the couch
jumped out of the ninety-third floor of a buildin'
and shot every window out on the way down to the ground (keep filmin'!)
woke up to a hospital staff, got up and laughed
chopped 'em in half and suffocated your oxygen mask
shit, if i get any higher i'ma get the east and west beefin' again
fly back to detroit and stand in the crossfire


a'ight, yo, yo, yo

i'm only smilin' when i'm violent, got on a plane wylin'
told the pilot to fly me to tylenol island (now)
stewardess like, "you restless?" "nah, bitch, i'm restful
just hold this fuckin' jet still so i can eat these pretzels"
forget school, the other kids are disrespectful
they hold me down and play connect-the-dots with my freckles (leave me alone)
i can't take it, i'm tryin' to gain weight, so i eat steak
swallow the whole plate and weigh myself naked (
