woo!!! yeah!!! remix!!! (50 cent: ha ha!!!)
lloyd banks!!! (lloyd banks: uh huh!!!) ha ha!!!


it's like a throne that he don't even own
he won't sit down, give him a crown, he just throws it around
it’s like a joke, he’s like a king, but he don’t rule a thing
he don't want the diamonds, want the gold or want the jewelry
he don't want the ring, don't want the loot, he's in it for the sport
running circles 'round his competition on the court
he appreciates your support, but he ain't beggin' for it
and you can love it, you can hate it, but you can't ignore it
you can't be that ig-nor-ant, though you can try to sell him short
but you can't fuck with his last joint or the one before it
and he was born to raise hell like them country boys
and if i'm frontin', man, you better come confront me for it
