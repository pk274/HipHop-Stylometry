whose arm is this? i must have cut it off at the pharmacist
that refused to renew my seventh prescription of darvocets (sorry!)
i'm the old man who lives upstairs and starves his pets
that never leaves his house 'cause he thinks his car's possessed
i hate my life that's why i degrade my wife
grabbed a paper plate to make a sandwich and just ate the knife
my mother's screamin', "please, heal him, take him straight to christ!"
meet you in the street and slap you just to break the ice (what up? i'm eminem)
made a bomb threat with a fake device
strip you naked twice, pistol-whip you and force you to take advice
and if you catch me bobbin' my head to some bullshit you was spittin'
i was probably just tryin' to shake the lice
bugs fallin' out of my head, i'm wishin' i was dead
while i'm crawlin' out of my bed, piss and vomit red
and my rash is returnin', i feel the sensation of burnin'
occurrin', usually during pain for release of my urine
screamin' at my shadow, "please, quit followin' me!"
these pills keep screamin', "please, quit swallowin' me!"
the devil keeps screamin', "please, get down on one knee!"
i took the drugs before the cops ever found them on me
