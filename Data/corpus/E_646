yeah, it's like a jungle sometimes, it makes me wonder
why i keep on duckin' under the bed when i hear thunder
'cause i ain't crazy, i say shit that's crazy to crazy people
to make 'em believe i'm crazy, so they can relate to me
and maybe believe in shady, so they can be evil, baby, i like that!
i'm only as crazy as people made me
believe me, they'd be just as many mutherfuckin' murderers
and heroin users without marilyn's music
but i figure, i make my music, i don't care if you use it
to murder somebody, i just wanna be there when you do it!
now the parents are suin'
'cause little darren is screwin' karen and susan
'cause i told him to do it on clue's new shit
now it's all ruined, the whole world is fucked up
'cause of me, two 12-year old girls is knocked up
my attitude's 'fuck it!' like pac's was at one point
wanna come join? pick up a glock and just point
now everybody's killin' everybody and everybody's bloody
and i'm just laughin' like it's funny
'cause i don't really give a shit about no-motherfuckin'-body
i'm so motherfuckin' nutty, i don't give a fuck about nothin'!


it's just, mr. meth and dj clue
i ain't crazy, i just do what the beat say do
it's just, slim shady and dj clue
i ain't evil, i just do what the beat say do
uhh, uhh, royce 5'9" and dj clue
i ain't bad, i just do what the beat say do
