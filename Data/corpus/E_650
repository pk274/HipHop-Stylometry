all them gangsta motherfuckers that went platinum
i had 'em hold out their hands and i put a gat in ’em
looked 'em in the faces, then spat in 'em
i picked the meanest rott’ in this
look at when it got in his face, it started swattin' til' dark
his eyes have gotten monotonous
'cause all ya bitches swear ya made of cement
if you would've just had my fucking money
i'd be straight as a split
but all ya multi-millionaires have never paid us in rent
so outta housin' motherfuckers, never made us a cent, hook


what's your intent?
i’m analyzing every cut you’re in to judge your intent
i wanna know where you stand, i mean as far as who you are
how would you act if you woke up and tomorrow you're a star?


i made a little change
now they got me doing some shows with hoes in them
but i ain’t change
i still wear my clothes with holes in 'em
and wear my hair however i like
bic it to stick it up, slick it back
lick it, mat it, and then pat it down to spike it
i'm happy to be alive and well
but it's probably way too happy to be when you’re surviving hell
but in a way i think i'm kinda glad a tad
'cause i appreciate the good now that i've had it bad
now i'mma run it back

i come from a dysfunctional family
where there wasn't nothin' but flunkies and drug addicts and drugs in our family
the only one that ever was the closest to us died
my uncle couldn't take it no more and chose to suicide
my other uncle was sentenced and just made his entry
for a quarter of century in a state penitentiary
and i could do is tell him to stick it out
meanwhile i'mma kick it to hell and back
and try to spit, which probably my only ticket out

the rapper that's real's the one who stuck to his roots
because he got a hold of them so much they stuck to his boots
and the only way to tell if he's really real is
wait until he's made a mil' and then you ask him will he still
and if with us still he will
'cause soul intent'll trample groups and any stupid soloers
who poops all over sample loops and stoop to go so low as this
'cause if an act is what you teach, you reap what you sow
but if you practice what you preach, you keep what you know
