yeah, you got me
i’m up now, it’s your loss
must suck to be you


there must've been a gust of wind
‘cause you change your mind every time it blows
and you just changed it a-motherfuckin'-gain
you just said you just wanted some dick 'fore i stuck it in
i wouldn't have been such a prick to you, fuckin' men
you say you don't trust 'em
why do i hear the sound of toilets flushin'?
some shit is goin' down
you must've just not been truthful from the start
see for me it’d be nothin' to say you never had my heart
but i’d be lyin'
fuckin' see why they call this bullshit a relationship: ships sink
and you know it's love as soon as you fall in it ‘cause shit stinks
and it feels like every time i fuckin' do i get jinxed
cupid must have put a curse on me, six weeks
have went by and we only spoke twice
i’m sittin' in your driveway, callin' you from the car, suffice
i think it's safe to say you’re not at home
i’m callin' your cell phone
you answer but i can tell though that you're not alone
how was i to know?
it should've been time to go a long time ago
i kept holdin' on, it's comical
when i think back now why i couldn't get the hint
and feel the draft you were throwin', i wasn't catchin' your drift
but there's a cold breeze blowin' over me, i'm over you
success is the best revenge to pay you back
and that payment is overdue
i overcame odds to get even
the sober me is shittin' all over the un-sober you
and i hope they play this in every club that you're goin' to
i’m hauntin' you, bitch, everywhere you turn i'm followin' you
‘cause i loved you with every ounce of me, you know it's true
it's killin' you now, yeah, i hope the ho dies slow in you
it's ‘cause of you now i don’t trust ‘em at all, fuck 'em!
middle finger up, imma just keep grabbin' my balls, cup 'em
i’ll never fall again, i trip on stairs, i fall up 'em
so, buttercup, don't try to come back knockin' on my door all dolled up


‘cause i’m movin' on, don’t worry about me
‘cause i’m gon' be just fine without you, you’ll see
there ain't no one on this earth right now i’d much rather be
‘cause, goddamn it, i’m glad that i’m me


i said if you could be where i’m at (bye, bye)
you’d wanna be you too (i'ma be good without you)
if you felt the way i feel, i bet you’d be in as good a mood as i am
but you don’t ‘cause you just feel like you
i said if you could be where i’m at (bye, bye)
you’d wanna be you too (i'ma be good without you)
if you felt the way i feel, i bet you’d be in as good a mood as i am
but you don’t ‘cause you just feel like you


‘cause i’m movin' on, don’t worry about me
‘cause i’m gon' be aight without you, you’ll see
