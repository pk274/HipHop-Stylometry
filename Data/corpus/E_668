better hope an ambulance is en route
papers are hand grenades soon as i pull the pin out
i am the santa fe, mandalay and orlando and colorado and columbine
all combined into one, i don't walk a line, bitch, i run
'cause we don't got no time to waste, so come on denaun
here come me, 5-to-9 and thought, da-dun, da-dun
then like a shotgun i'm ready to cock it on 'em
leave these pussies stretched out like the octomom
never had no trouble keepin' up with the times
i just adapt to the climate, i treat it like my levi's
when they ain't buttoned up right, i adjust on the fly
middle fingers, put 'em high, that's why they call it a bird
'cause you put it up in the sky
and i'm like a spider crawlin' up your spinal column
i'm climbin' all up the sides of the asylum wall
and dive in a pile of tylenol, you're like a vagina problem
to a diabolical gynecologist tryna ball a fist, i will
fuck you, just buy me, double timing the rhyming
i leave you stymied, that's why they still vilify me like bill o'reilly
i'ma show you what i mean when they call me the harvey weinstein of 2019
i'm a conniving, when i'm on the mic, i'ma stand out
like a lime green wife beater with a knife out
i'm a sight to see, but you can see from the ring i'm wearing
me and this game, we got married already
had the prenup ready, fucked on her, should've seen her belly
she barely was three months pregnant
bitch had it, gave me a baby, we named it machine gun kelly
now here's to ll, big l and del
k-solo, treach, and g rap
dj polo, tony d, odb, moe dee, run-dmc
ed o.g., and epmd, d.o.c., ice-t, evil dee
king tee, utfo, and schoolly d, pe, and bdp
yz and chi-ali, rakim and eric b., they were like my therapy
from b.i.g. and paris, three times dope, and some we'll never see, and prt
n.w.a and eazy-e, and d-r-e was like my gps
without him, i don't know where i'd be
