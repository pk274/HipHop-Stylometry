never sold dope for no gold rope
wanted one though, they were so dope (yeah)
was a have-not (yeah) 'cause my pockets (uh)
didn't have knots, i was so broke
on my last rock, for my slingshot
better haul ass, don't be no slow poke (nope)
through the tall grass, run your ass off (yeah)
oh no, got your pants caught on the fence post
getting chased, by them jackboys, think it's 'bout to fuzz
like a lint roller they wait 'til it's late, they will tiptoe
through your living room window
take your nintendo and then skate
making you feel like you got bent over and raped
little boy, you're never gonna get no rope chain
get your shit stole, and your lip swole, i became bitter
as i got a little bit older, my hate
was making me get cold, and began to get a chipped shoulder
started to spit vulgar, my zip code had been skid row
but i ate every single beat that i spit over, the shithole i escaped
then i began to explode, detonate, now the eastside went schizo
thought my name was b-side 'cause they flipped over my tape
and i won't hesitate
to get 'em all bent so outta shape (fuck)
shit, bro, hold up, wait
i just tripped over my cape (superman)
and i'm not gonna let up, treat the paper like i'm chopping a letter
dre'll tell you how i shred
so when you refer to the guy next to the doc, you meant shredder
now the cops wanna set up roadblocks on my head, i
got several bounties from feds in every county
i'm with a gal at a checkers wiling
bumping "fuck da police" while i fed her rally's
this shit is like romper room
why do i feel responsible for these kids?
all of whom i'm a father to
i'm a god to you, y'all better worship the water i walk on
or y'all gonna meet your waterloo
i get to flippin' the mic' as a murder weapon
i'm poppin' an extra clip, then cock and shoot, then i'm popping
do not let me catch you slippin'
i will pop up and i'll take a spot from you
i'll get to doing what a leaky faucet do
but i ain't talkin' drip when i say that i'll get the drop on you
singin' fuck all of you in autotune
i am too volatile and too grizzly to bear
yeah, shit is gettin' to where i can barely even sit in a chair
i bust my ass for this shit and i swear
it ain't even worth dissing someone so offbeat
that they can't even figure out where their words
should hit the kick and the snare
