nobody don't care, no matter how hard i try
(my mama told me there'd be days like this, but i'm pissed)
look to the sky, and i ask god why
(rotten black cotton in god's eyes)
nobody don't care, seems like my dreams
(my mama told me there'd be days like this, but i'm pissed)
drowned in by screams, no answer to my questions
(rotten black cotton in god's eyes)
nobody don't care, feels like i'm pressed
(my mama told me there'd be days like this, but i'm pissed)
why do i stress? it's like i'm bein' tested
(rotten black cotton in god's eyes)
nobody don't care, seems like my prayers
vanished in thin air, please answer my questions (my man)
nobody don't care
