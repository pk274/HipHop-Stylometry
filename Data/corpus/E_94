obie, yo
i'm sick
damn, you straight, dog?


that's why i ain't got no time (i think i got chlamydia)
for these games and stupid tricks
or these bitches (bitch!) on my dick
that's how dudes be gettin' sick (that bitch!)
that's how dicks be gettin' drips
fallin' victims to this shit
from these bitches on our dicks
fuckin' chickens with no ribs
that's why i ain't got no time


that's why i ain't got no time
for these games and stupid tricks
or these bitches on my dick
that's how dudes be gettin' sick
that's how dicks be gettin' drips
fallin' victims to this shit
from these bitches on our dicks
fuckin' chickens with no ribs
that's why i ain't got no time


now i don't wanna hit no woman, but this chick's got it comin'
someone better get this bitch 'fore she gets kicked in the stomach
and she's pregnant, but she's eggin' me on, beggin' me to throw her
off the steps of this porch, my only weapon is force
and i don't wanna resort to violence of any sort
though what's she shovin' me for? (bitch!) doesn't she love me no more?
wasn't she huggin' me four minutes ago at the door?
man, i'm this close to goin' toe-to-toe with this whore
what would you do if she was tellin' you she wants a divorce?
she's havin' another baby in a month, and it's yours
and you found out it isn't, 'cause this bitch has been visitin' someone else
and suckin' his dick and kissin' you on the lips when you get back to michigan
now the plot is thickenin' worse
‘cause you feel like you've been stickin' your fuckin' dick in a hearse
so you're paranoid at every little cold that you get
ever since they sold you this shit, you've been holdin' your dick
so you go to the clinic, sweatin' every minute you in it
then the doctor comes out, lookin' like dennis the menace (ha-ha-ha-ha-ha)
and it's obvious to everyone in the lobby it's aids (sorry)
he ain't even gotta call you in his office to say it (sorry)
so you jet back home, 'cause you gon' get that ho
when you see her, you gon' bend her fuckin' neck back, yo
'cause you love her, you never would expect that blow
obie told you the scoop, how could she stoop that low?
jesus, i don't believe this bitch works at the cleaner's
bringin' me home diseases, swingin' from obie's penis
she's so deceivin', shit, this ho's a genius, she g'd us


that's why i ain't got no time
for these games and stupid tricks
or these bitches on my dick
that's how dudes be gettin' sick
that's how dicks be gettin' drips
fallin' victims to this shit
from these bitches on our dicks
fuckin' chickens with no ribs
that's why i ain't got no time
