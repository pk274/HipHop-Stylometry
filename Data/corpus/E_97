are we swaggered up?
swaggered up, yeah
let's do it, baby, radio 1, westwood, sample's about to go down
check my swag
eminem, kon, baby, alchemist, we're doin' it like this
yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
let's go, baby
a'ight, a'ight, look


i wasn't born mean, i was pushed to treachery
i walk the streets, lookin' for some puss to fetch me
i'm like a veggie, brain is turned to mush, i'm edgy
edgy enough to give reggie bush a wedgie
if he don't gimme kim, things could get messy
so pass that ass to me, let me squish the left cheek
and press against the right one 'til it's smushed against me
and leave a dead body in the woods, the emcee
with the christopher reeves beef, we started off on the wrong foot
or should i say fake leg made outta wood?
i shouldn't, yes, i should
ridin' through the hood, i'm chillin' with westwood
i'm quite mellow, a white fellow
my pee is bright yellow, i like jell-o
i'm like, "hello," to a cute little dyke on the mic
i'm kinda like iron mike 'cause i bite earlobes


yeah
well, i must must say (yeah?)
well, um, i'm just not gay
well, um, i must must say
um, well, look- (mr. porter, son)


yeah, aight
me and westwood, blastin' off, jackin' off
in a pair of acid-washed, bumpin' asher roth
cruisin' gratiot 'til i damn near crashed the car
i'm tryna smash 'em off in the dash, hit the overpass, went off (woo!)
over the bridge, into oncoming traffic, caused
a massive forty-two car pile-up, not a scratch at all (woo!)
hopped up holdin' an axe and saw
jason mask is off when my face is plastered in tabasco sauce
spittin' flames, kickin' fire out your ass, you little bastard
you can pass it on, i'm battery acid, dawg
you don't wanna get my ass ticked off
i'm harder than playin' basketball while i'm goin' through crack withdrawal (woo!)
dick so big it's like elastic
i tie it in a knot and it looks like mr. fantastic crossed
the path of plastic man with a drastic force
and went spastic, put my penis on classic sports (look)


i shoot straight off the hip, trey-eight off the rip
but see, i ain't fo' that shit
i got a fist print fo' yo' lip
lookin' shit is swole up like the stomach on a fat pregnant bitch
and it's evident that i get chips like the president
been a lotta rules, keep the tools for the haters left
niggas ain't fadin' 'em, seal a crack, do a trim
got a lot of dough, but you know i ain't trickin' on 'em
get some head spinnin' on 'em, keep the head spinnin' on 'em
see, i ain't diggin' on 'em, keep the head hidden from 'em
you know how it go, no dough trickin' on 'em
she just wanna blow, see what she can get from 'em
but she don't know my name, i'm 'bout the game, i'm pickin' on her
wrist so cold that my left hand's numb as summer
i rip a hole 'til she don't want you gettin' on her
she makes you wonder if the women even want ya
mr. porter, keep a ho in order
learned it from my daddy, i teach it to my daughter (yeah)
ya ought to know the quota of my whole workout
i float like noah and i don't want the boat to rover bounce


ahaha, yeah
yeah, ayy, let's change that beat, homie
yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
where's the swag juice, al?
come on, homie
swag drip
swag is dryin' up right now
where's the swag?

yeah, yeah, yeah
yeah, yeah, yeah
alright, alright
yeah, yeah
yo


once again, it's the sinister, cynical, minister shady
kryptonite to superman, he's a dentist to amy
administer of the pain, just finished huffin' the paint
and muffled the fumes like it was nothin', because it ain't
anything in his way, his enemies he just slays
his venom he spray reaches like beams of energy rays
menacin' stares, he glares, makin' the hairs
all on the back of yo' neck stand like dracula, yep
spectacular rep, he's a tarantula, gargantuan
yeah, angela, so i command you to start dancin'
part manson, part hannibal, part mechanical shark
throwin' animal parts at scarlett johansson
enter my gas chamber, you're gangsta my ass
he's got his fangs to your neck, he's set to strangle ya ass, hater
you're facin' a task greater, he's chasin' your ass
he's got his face in a mask, your bloodstains on his glass table


bitch!
yeah, yeah, yeah
aight


i'm checking the exposure of photos of me exposing
myself locked inside of a cozy hotel, posing
with or without clothing, next to the decomposing
bodies eroding while i'm dozing off, overdosing
windows opening, shutting, doors opening, closing
i think there's a ghost, too much hydrocodone and codeine
i was only s'posed to swallow a half, i took the whole thing
i'm not joking, i think i just snorted my nose ring
i need a drink, i'm standin' over the sink, posing
myself, self-loathing, 'cause i'm on a brink, mostly
i don't wanna think, "this will make everything rosy"
beverly sings, scream while i'm severing three toe-sies
totally frozen while i close in, i'm yodeling
"rosey, won't you come out to play?" ain’t no sense
wasting time, cutting and pasting headlines in the papers
making shrines of my crimes and capers
my words are whirlwinds, i murder my girlfriends
go to europe and put neurofens in my syrup and stir them
you never heard him like this, so don't encourage him
the neurosurgeon, coke mirrors, and lyrics worse than
the kinda person to get katie couric to cursin'
eighty spirits of ladies 'cause shady murdered the virgins
crazy turn of events, and then he emerged, took
over the world and reeled in all the children
lured 'em into the buildin' and killed 'em
buried 'em in the mulch and mildew and he will do what he feels, and
still can spin straw into gold like rumpelstiltskin
cotton to silk, motrin to tylenol— three pills, the real slim
shady's entered the buildin'
there's nothin' but crumbled leaves and tumbleweeds up in this bitch, mildrid
he's ill wit' it, he still shouldn't be healed
there's no one as sick as he, emcees'll get fricasseed on the grill then


fuck that! aha
right now
ahahahaha
building's on fire
fuck you, em!
you want to start with the hook first?
oh, okayi have no idea what i'm doing

everybody get up, sit up, christopher
they're miserable without you, superman is a-
-live and he's flowin' like the mystic river
girl, don't act like you've never been kissed before
one, two, three, four, five, six, this-a
rhyme is about to hit you right in the kisser
how did anybody ever find me? i disa-
-ppeared, i was hidin' in freeway's beard, just a
hop, skip and i jump from my skin gushin'
nails into my face that i've been pushin'
hellraiser, my face is my pin cushion
it's like when i'm on the mic, i can squish a
sucker like a vise grip, my pen put ya
in the slaughterhouse, 'cause your style's been butchered
i'll spin chainsaw, take off, like the blades on
my brain's on hyperdrive, someone put the brakes on

slim is in the house, simmer down there, sister
bound to get you dizzy, 'cause he gets as busy as a
bee- baby, you could throw a frisbee in a blizzard
he'll catch it in his teeth, what is he? he's a wizard
standin' in the disco with a disco biscuit
and i'm pretty sure it isn't bisquick, is it?

i want the kiss 'fore i blow this bitch to smithe-
-reens, get the guillotines, this is a situ-
-ation that's critical as dre spins his, uh
turntables and he cuts the record like a scissor
checka-chicky-checka-chicky-checka-checka-chicka
we'll wreck it in a second, tell me what the heck is sicker?

-clock in the mornin', 'less you want to get some dessert

just so everybody knows, that was a hook
that we made on the way to the radio station
and we were tryin' to get it right
so we may have fucked it up a couple times or whatever, but
this is what we were tryin' to, like, work out before we came here
especially for westwood, man! 'specially for you, homie!
damn, eminem! thanks for listening, baby
