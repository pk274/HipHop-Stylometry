aw, yeah (it's like this, like this)
it's eminem, baby
back up in that motherfuckin' ass
('til forever, 'til forever)
one time for your motherfuckin' mind (for mcs, mcs)
we represent the 313—you know what i’m sayin'?
yo, they don’t know shit about this, for the '96


ayo, my pen and paper cause a chain reaction
to get your brain relaxin', the zany actin' maniac in action
a brainiac, in fact, son, you mainly lack attraction
you look insanely wack when just a fraction of my tracks runs
my rhymin' skills got you climbin' hills
i travel through your mind and chill your spine like siren drills
i'm slimin' grills of roaches with spray that disinfects
and twistin' necks of rappers 'til their spinal column disconnects
put this in decks and check the monologue, turn your system up
twist 'em up and indulge in the marijuana smog
this is the season for noise pollution contamination
examination of more car-tunes than animation
my lamination of nar-er-ration, hits a snare and bass
on a track for duck rapper interrogation
when i declare invasion, there ain't no time to be starin' gazin'
i turn the stage into a barren wasteland
i'm infinite


you heard of hell, well, i was sent from it
i went to it, servin' a sentence for murderin' instruments
now i'm tryin' to repent from it, but when i hear the beat
i'm tempted to make another attempt at it
i'm infinite


bust it, i let the beat commence
so i can beat the sense in your elite defense
i got some meat to mince
some fruit to stomp, and then two feet to rinse
i greet the gents and ladies, i spoil loyal fans
i foil plans and leave fluids leakin' like oil pans
my coiled hands around this microphone are lethal
one thought in my cerebral is deeper than a jeep-full of people
mcs are feeble, i came to cause some pandemonium
battle a band of phony mcs and stand the lonely one
imitator intimidator, stimulator
simulator of data, eliminator
there's never been a greater since the burial of jesus
fuck around and catch all the venereal diseases
my thesis'll smash a stereo to pieces
my acappella releases classic masterpieces, through telekinesis
it eases you mentally, gently
sentimentally, instrumentally
with entity, dementedly meant to be infinite

man, i got evidence, i'm never dense
and i've been clever ever since
my residence was hesitant to do some shit that represents the mo
so i'm assumin' all responsibility
'cause there's a monster real in me that always wants to kill mcs
mic nestler, slammin' like a wrestler
here to make a mess of a lyric-smugglin' embezzler
no one is specialer, my skill is intergalactical
i get cynical, act a fool then i send a crew back to school
i never packed a tool or acted cool, it wasn't practical
i'd rather let a tactical, tactful track tickle your fancy
in fact, i can't see, or can't imagine
a man who ain't a lover of beats or a fan of scratchin'
so this is for my family, the kid who had a cameo
on my last jam plus the man who never had a plan b
be all you can be
‘cause once you make an instant hit, i'm tensed a bit
and tempted when i see the sins my friends commit
i'm infinite

jealous?
what he mean "jealous"? you know what i'm sayin'?
he just mad 'cause he all with them ugly hoes, know what i'm sayin'?
girls don't buy him no clothes, he bought that ho some clothes!
he don't buy me no clothes, and they ain't got no money
no vibe, no dick, i mean, what do i got to be jealous fo'?
he ain't gonna make it nowhere
he ain't got no type of time, he has no career move, i mean—


i come home every single day from workin' double shifts
and stop along the way to pick you up a couple gifts
i come inside and you pretend you miss me when you kiss me
then you diss me and we strenuously fight continuously
again you frisk me, for numbers, tryin' to bust me
it must be only just because you never learned to trust me
plus we only squabble over irrelevant issues
too many tissues for my feelings you misuse
i buy you jewelry, you make a fool of me
i bring you diamond rings, you say i'm bad at timin' things
so what's a man to do when all i hand to you is handed back to me?
you act to be this gangsta bitch, that ain't what first attracted me
i used to love your company, now you're always pumpin' me
for information, and you tell your friends you plan on dumpin' me
so i'ma wait for your evacuation
'cause every accusation makes me wanna smack your face in
see, i've never been so sure, and you're just insecure
so my solution to your jealousy presents a cure
i recommend you take your things and check 'em in
look at the nervous wreck i'm in, i need my second wind
say what?—


jealous! (oh, jealousy, jealousy!)
jealous! (oh, jealousy, jealousy!)
jealous! (oh, jealousy, jealousy!)
jealous! (oh, jealousy, jealousy!)
jealous! (oh, jealousy, jealousy!)
jealous! (oh, jealousy, jealousy!)
jealous! (oh, jealousy, jealousy!)
jealous! (oh, jealousy, jealousy!)


fuck you and what you goin' through!
fuck eminem! he's mad 'cause i left that nigga for another man
to me, eminem don't mean nothin' but minus money
immature, me? nigga, ain't got no dick
no swang in his thang, know what i'm sayin'?
he just mad 'cause i'm gettin' it all night, jealous of me
know what i'm sayin'? that's what i'm talkin' about
motherfucker just clock in this pussy, pfft


i used to be a puppet and a sucker for your silent treatments
i used to be intoxicated with your sweet scents
until the day i started followin' your feetprints
and tappin' in your phone conversations through the heat vents
it made complete sense: there's someone else you like
so i confronted you and asked you, "who was mike?" and you was like
"i need a new nigga! someone rich that i could follow
and you'll be over me by the time you see tomorrow!"
leavin' me in sorrow, brandy never felt so brokenhearted
i fell apart when you departed, then the jokin' started
i was an open target, you play comedian
and i became the laughingstock, but now, i'm on my feet again
and so, we meet again, you're actin' like an ex-wife
all in my sex life, i got a message from phife
it goes, "you didn't want me to see yo' hon, don't want me now
take the towel, wipe your brow!" quit tryin' to hunt me down!
you run me down and now you're tryin' to apologize
for all the lies and every time you made me bawl my eyes
because i got a bigger wallet size, you wanna swing it
jealousy is in the house, y'all— fellas, sing it!


jealous! (oh, jealousy, jealousy!)
jealous! (oh, jealousy, jealousy!)
jealous! (oh, jealousy, jealousy!)
jealous! (oh, jealousy, jealousy!)
jealous! (oh, jealousy, jealousy!)
jealous! (oh, jealousy, jealousy!)
jealous! (oh, jealousy, jealousy!)
jealous! (oh, jealousy, jealousy!)
jealous! (oh, jealousy, jealousy!)
jealous! (oh, jealousy, jealousy!)
jealous! (oh, jealousy, jealousy!)
jealous! (oh, jealousy, jealousy!)

'cause i'm tired of bein' broke


'cause all i do is yearn a life without a concern
and dream of havin' a turn to earn money to burn
mappin' out my strategies to get rich, huh
my desire's like a scratch that needs to get itched, huh
'cause, man, i live in the d, this shit ain't given for free
nothin's different to me, so what else is there to see?
i'll be the prisoner to flee from all of this misery
i'm not wishin' to be another fish in the sea
but just an mc, so listen to me for this and agree
you're missin' the key, you ain't even in the vicinity
unconditionally, my aspects to cash checks
my objects were never to swab decks
it's up to you, the decision is yours
if what you vision is tours or a mission-less course
when your shit is in the stores, 'cause you can be a star


no matter wherever you are

bummin' rides everywhere i go, yeah

ayo, i'm not about to chance it and dismiss handlin' business
i'm cancelin' christmas to gamble and risk this
financial interest is the matter at hand
i got an adequate plan for a stab at a grand
i grab what i can and do what i must
pursue what i lust, it's true that i just choose a few that i trust
them's the people that i still got
fuck with gangsta philpot, get your grill shot
the 5 ela for life: my man thyme
proof, kyu and denaun, we move through in the nine
my crew's true and divine, we never fronted
we just wanted to be funded, and live to be a hundred
instead of hunted or bein' wanted like fugitives
it's all about a man plannin' what his future is
what he can do for his, to be a star


no matter wherever you are
you're never too far from revenue, huh?
'cause you can be king

gettin' money any time i want, ownin' my own businesses and all that
you know what i'm sayin'? yeah, i'm tryna be a millionaire, baby
hahaha, it's all on you though
you only live once, '96, baby

i'm givin' mad love, i'm snugglin' hugs
strugglin' thugs, smugglin' drugs
jugglin' jobs, guzzlin' jugs
so here's a toast to federal checks
hetero sex, unaffordable medical debts, huh
we travel in packs, unravelin' facts
and gravel in cracks to find babblin' max, gafflin' tracks
i grapple an axe for them bafflin' acts
of mysterious stab-in-the-backs who dabble in wax
stealin' my art when i sculpt it
the culprit that stole shit'll end up with his skull split
then i bury the hatchet, i carry the fat shit
butter fingers is here when it's necessary to scratch it
baby, all i wanna do is swallow one or two
smoke a little bit and follow one of you
back home when the party ends
so tonight i'm droppin' naughty hints
to the finest women in the audience


'cause we came here to do this tonight
we don't wanna fight, we don't want no one feelin' uptight
'cause we came here to do this tonight
'till the morning light, hope that everyone's feelin' alright
'cause we came here to do this tonight
we don't wanna fight, we don't want no one feelin' uptight
'cause we came here to do this tonight
'till the morning light, hope that everyone's feelin' alright


ayo, biters are like tarantulas, vandalers
livin' as scandalous as a television evangelist
but i can handle this, i'm the rhyme biter, crime fighter
caped crusader, takin' care of undeservin' limelighters
i think we live an era meant for me
experimentally i found a way to spread the terror mentally
when i stumbled upon this resolution
by usin' a special fusion of chemical solution for this fresh illusion
you couldn't see me with binoculars
i'm armed like an octopus
step on stage and you'll get socked and pushed
talkin' that junk like you had black bart at your back
come to battle me and you get smacked hard as you act
when i rep-a-resent it and will have a referee in it
every minute, so when i win it you never resent it
i'm forever demented
come up with funk, i'll never be scented
you got the point when i cleverly sent it


'cause we came here to do this tonight
we don't wanna fight, we don't want no one feelin' uptight
'cause we came here to do this tonight
'till the morning light, hope that everyone's feelin' alright
'cause we came here to do this tonight
we don't wanna fight, we don't want no one feelin' uptight
'cause we came here to do this tonight
'till the morning light, hope that everyone's feelin' alright


eminem is headed skyward
for those who thought that i would
make you bored and treat you like a piece of plywood
i've got miracle lyrical capability all in me
with the agility to escape a killer bee colony
so get your cameras and capture how miraculous
i rap for all you draculas
and showed you all how wack you was
i meant it as a diss
'cause you don't posses the pizzazz of this
i'm hazardous enough already as it is
without you addin' fuel to the fire, i'm cruel to the liar
who fails to recognize my reign and hail rule to the sire
clinical studies show that i'm cynical
there's no one who's identical
to my fresh and authentic flow
i'm sure the party people can agree
when i'm enchantin' with a romantically
freakin' vocal so frantically
so throw your hands up in the atmosphere
and let them know the only party that was phat was here
just be like


'cause we came here to do this tonight
we don't wanna fight, we don't want no one feelin' uptight
'cause we came here to do this tonight
'till the morning light, hope that everyone's feelin' alright
'cause we came here to do this tonight
we don't wanna fight, we don't want no one feelin' uptight
'cause we came here to do this tonight
'till the morning light, hope that everyone's feelin' alright
