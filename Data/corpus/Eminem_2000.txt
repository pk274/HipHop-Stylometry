(he's) mentally ill from amityville

i get lifted and spin 'til i'm half-twisted
feet planted and stand with a grin full of chapped lipstick
pen full of ink, think sinful and rap sick shit
shrink, pencil me in for my last visit
drink gin 'til my chin's full of splashed whiskers
hash, whiskey, and ash 'til i slap bitches
ask bizzy, he's been here the past six years
mash with me again and imagine this

i fucked my cousin in his asshole, slit my mother's throat (aahh!)
guess who slim shady just signed to interscope
my little sister's birthday, she'll remember me
for a gift i had ten of my boys take her virginity
and bitches know me as a horny-ass freak
their mother wasn't raped, i ate her pussy while she was sleep
pissy-drunk, throwin' up in the urinal
(you fuckin' homo!) that's what i said at my dad's funeral

that's why the city is filled with a bunch of fuckin' idiots still (still!)
that's why the first motherfucker poppin' some shit, he gets killed (killed!)
that's why we don't call it detroit, we call it amityville (ville!)
you can get capped after just havin' a cavity filled (aha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!)
that's why we're crowned the murder capital still (still!)
this ain't detroit, this is motherfuckin' hamburger hill (hill!)
we don't do drive-bys, we park in front of houses and shoot (shoot!)
and when the police come we fuckin' shoot it out with 'em too (too!)
that's the mentality here (here!), that's the reality here (here!)
did i just hear somebody say they wanna challenge me here? (huh?!)
while i'm holdin' a pistol with this many calibers here? (here!)
plus a registration that just made this shit valid this year? (year!)
'cause once i snap, i can't be held accountable for my actions

a lot of people ask me stupid fuckin' questions
a lot of people think that what i say on a record
or what i talk about on a record
that i actually do in real life or that i believe in it
or if i say that i wanna kill somebody
that i'm actually gonna do it or that i believe in it
well, shit, if you believe that, then i'll kill you
you know why? 'cause i'm a criminal!
criminal! you're goddamn right
i'm a criminal! yeah, i'm a criminal!

my words are like a dagger with a jagged edge
that'll stab you in the head, whether you're a fag or lez
or a homosex, hermaph or a trans-a-vest
pants or dress, hate fags? the answer's yes
homophobic? nah, you're just heterophobic
starin' at my jeans, watchin' my genitals bulgin' (ooh!)
that's my motherfuckin' balls, you'd better let go of 'em
they belong in my scrotum, you'll never get hold of 'em!
"hey, it's me, versace! whoops, somebody shot me!
and i was just checkin' the mail, get it? checkin' the male?"
how many records you expectin' to sell
after your second lp sends you directly to jail?
come on, relax, guy! i like gay men
right, ken? give me an amen! (a-men!)
"please lord, this boy needs jesus
heal this child, help us destroy these demons
oh, and please send me a brand new car
and a prostitute while my wife's sick in the hospital"
preacher, preacher! fifth grade teacher!
you can't reach me, my mom can't neither
you can't teach me a goddamn thing 'cause
i watch tv and comcast cable
and you ain't able to stop these thoughts
you can't stop me from toppin' these charts
and you can't stop me from droppin' each march
with a brand new cd for these fuckin' retards (duh)
and to think, it's just little ol' me
mr. don't-give-a-fuck still won't leave


i'm a criminal!
'cause every time i write a rhyme these people think it's a crime
to tell 'em what's on my mind, i guess i'm a criminal!
i don't gotta say a word, i just flip 'em the bird
and keep goin', i don't take shit from no one
i'm a criminal!
'cause every time i write a rhyme these people think it's a crime
to tell 'em what's on my mind, i guess i'm a criminal!
i don't gotta say a word, i just flip 'em the bird

the mother did drugs, hard liquor, cigarettes and speed
the baby came out, disfigured ligaments, indeed
it was a seed who would grow up just as crazy as she
don't dare make fun of that baby, 'cause that baby was me
i'm a criminal, an animal caged who turned crazed
but how the fuck you supposed to grow up when you weren't raised?
so as i got older and i got a lot taller
my dick shrunk smaller, but my balls got larger
i drank more liquor to fuck you up quicker
than you'd wanna fuck me up for sayin' the word—
my morals went *thhbbpp* when the president got oral
sex in his oval office on top of his desk off of his own employee
now, don't ignore me, you won't avoid me
you can't miss me: i'm white, blonde-haired, and my nose is pointy
i'm the bad guy who makes fun of people that die
in plane crashes and laughs as long as it ain't happenin' to him
slim shady, i'm as crazy as em-
-inem and kim combined (the maniac's in)
in place of the doctor 'cause dre couldn't make it today
he's a little under the weather, so i'm takin' his place (mm-mm-mmm!)
oh, that's dre with an ak to his face
don't make me kill him too and spray his brains all over the place
i told you, dre, you should've kept that thang put away
i guess that'll teach you not to let me play with it, eh?
i'm a criminal!


windows tinted on my ride when i drive in it (go, go, go!)
so when i rob a bank, run out and just dive in it
so i'll be disguised in it and if anybody identifies
the guy in it, i hide for five minutes
come back, shoot the eyewitness
fire at the private eye hired to pry in my business
die bitches, bastards, brats, pets
this puppy's lucky i didn't blast his ass yet
if i ever gave a fuck, i'd shave my nuts
tuck my dick in between my legs and cluck
you motherfuckin' chickens ain't brave enough
to say the stuff i say, so just tape it shut
shit, half the shit i say, i just make it up
to make you mad, so kiss my white naked ass
and if it's not a rapper that i make it as
i'ma be a fuckin' rapist in a jason mask


i'm a criminal!

oh, oh, ooh, ooh
i'll come in a minute
ayo, this is my love song, it goes like this
hey, yeah

back when mark wahlberg was marky mark (fuckin' faggot)
this is how we used to make the party start
we used to mix hen with bacardi dark
and when it kicks in you can hardly talk
and by the sixth gin you're gon' probably crawl
and you'll be sick then and you'll probably barf
and my prediction is you're gon' probably fall
either somewhere in the lobby or the hallway wall
and everything's spinnin', you're beginnin' to think women
are swimmin' in pink linen again in the sink, then in
a couple of minutes that bottle of guinness is finished
you are now allowed to officially slap bitches
you have the right to remain violent and start wilin'
start a fight with the same guy that was smart-eyein' you
get in your car, start it, and start drivin'
over the island and cause a 42-car pile-up
earth calling, pilot to co-pilot
looking for life on this planet, sir, no sign of it
all i can see is a bunch of smoke flyin'
and i'm so high that i might die if i go by it
let me outta this place, i'm outta place
i'm in outer space, i've just vanished without a trace
i'm going to a pretty place now where the flowers grow
i'll be back in an hour or so


‘cause every time i go to try to leave (whoa)
something keeps pullin' on my sleeve (whoa)
i don't wanna, but i gotta stay (whoa)
these drugs really got a hold of me (whoa)
‘cause every time i try to tell 'em "no" (no)
they won't let me ever let 'em go (go)
i'm a sucker all i gotta say (whoa)
these drugs really got a hold of me (whoa)

in third grade, all i used to do
was sniff glue through a tube and play rubik's cube
seventeen years later i'm as rude as jude
schemin' on the first chick with the hugest boobs
i've got no game, and every face looks the same
they've got no name, so i don't need game to play
i just say whatever i want to whoever i want
whenever i want, wherever i want, however i want
however, i do show some respect to few
this ecstasy's got me standin' next to you
gettin' sentimental as fuck, spillin' guts to you
we just met, but i think i'm in love with you
but you're on it too, so you tell me you love me too
wake up in the morning like, "yo, what the fuck we'd do?"
i gotta go, bitch, you know i got stuff to do
‘cause if i get caught cheatin', then i'm stuck with you
but in the long run, these drugs are probably
gonna catch up sooner or later, but fuck it, i'm on one
so let's enjoy, let the x destroy your spinal cord
so it's not a straight line no more
'til we walk around lookin' like some wind-up dolls
shit's stickin' out of our backs like a dinosaur
shit, six hits won't even get me high no more
so bye for now, i'm gonna try to find some more


‘cause every time i go to try to leave (whoa)
something keeps pullin' on my sleeve (whoa)
i don't wanna, but i gotta stay (whoa)
these drugs really got a hold of me (whoa)
‘cause every time i try to tell 'em "no" (no)
they won't let me ever let 'em go (go)
i'm a sucker all i gotta say (whoa)
these drugs really got a hold of me (whoa)

that's the sound of a bottle when it's hollow
when you swallow it all wallow and drown in your sorrow
and tomorrow you're probably gonna wanna do it again
what's a little spinal fluid between you and a friend?
screw it! and what's a little bit of alcohol poisonin'?
and what's a little fight? tomorrow, you'll be boys again
it's your life, live it however you wanna
mari-ju-ana is everywhere, where was you brought up?
it don't matter as long as you get where you're goin'
‘cause none of this shit's gonna mean shit where we're goin'
they tell you to stop, but you just sit there ignorin'
even though you wake up feelin' like shit every mornin'
but you're young, you've got a lot of drugs to do
girls to screw, parties to crash, sucks to be you
if i could take it all back now, i wouldn't
i would have did more shit that people said that i shouldn't
but i'm all grown up now and upgraded
and graduated to better drugs and updated
but i still got a lotta growing up to do
i still got a whole lotta throwing up to spew
but when it's all said and done, i'll be forty
before i know it with a 40 on the porch tellin' stories
with a bottle of jack, two grandkids in my lap
babysittin' for hailie while hailie's out gettin' smashed


‘cause every time i go to try to leave (whoa)
something keeps pullin' on my sleeve (whoa)
i don't wanna, but i gotta stay (whoa)
these drugs really got a hold of me (whoa)
‘cause every time i try to tell 'em "no" (no)
they won't let me ever let 'em go (go)
i'm a sucker all i gotta say (whoa)
these drugs really got a hold of me (whoa)

‘cause every time i go to try to leave (whoa)

drugs really got a hold of me
really got a hold of me
these drugs really got a hold of me
they really got a hold of me

that's why they call me slim shady (i'm back)
i'm back (i'm back), i'm back (slim shady!)
that's why they call me slim shady (i'm back)

i murder a rhyme, one word at a time
you never heard of a mind as perverted as mine
you better get rid of that .9, it ain't gonna help
what good's it gonna do against a man that strangles himself?
i'm waitin' for hell, like hell, shit, i'm anxious as hell
manson, you're safe in that cell, be thankful it's jail
i used to be my mommy's little angel at twelve
thirteen, i was puttin' shells in a gauge on a shelf
i used to get punked and bullied on my block
'til i cut a kitten's head off and stuck it in this kid's mailbox
(hey ma', ma'!)
i used to give a fuck, now i could give a fuck less
what do i think of success? it sucks, too much press
i'm stressed, too much cess, depressed, too upset
it's just too much mess, i guess i must just blew up quick (yes)
grew up quick (no), was raised right
whatever you say is wrong, whatever i say's right
you think of my name now whenever you say, "hi"
became a commodity 'cause i'm w-h-i-
t-e, 'cause mtv was so friendly to me
can't wait 'til kim sees me
now, is it worth it? look at my life, how is it perfect?
read my lips, bitch! what, my mouth isn't workin'?
you hear this finger? oh, it's upside down
here, let me turn this motherfucker up right now


that's why they call me slim shady (i'm back)
i'm back (i'm back), i'm back (slim shady!)
that's why they call me slim shady (i'm back)
i'm back (i'm back), i'm back (slim shady!)
that's why they call me slim shady (i'm back)

i take each individual degenerate's head and reach into it
just to see if he's influenced by me, if he listens to music
and if he feeds into this shit, he's an innocent victim
and becomes a puppet on the string of my tennis shoe
(*scratches*) my name is slim shady
i been crazy way before radio didn't play me
the sensational (*scratch*), "back is the incredible!"
with ken kaniff, who just finds the men edible
it's ken kaniff on the internet
tryin' to lure your kids with him into bed (uh)
it's a sick world we live in these days
"slim, for pete's sakes, put down christopher reeve's legs!" ("oh, oh, oh, oh!")
geez, you guys are so sensitive
"slim, it's a touchy subject, try and just don't mention it"
mind with no sense in it, fried schizophrenic whose eyes get so squinted
i'm blind from smoke in 'em with my windows tinted
with nine limos rented, doin' lines of coke in 'em
with a bunch of guys hoppin' out, all high and indo-scented
and that's where i get my name from
that's why they call me—


they call me slim shady (i'm back)
i'm back (i'm back), i'm back (slim shady!)
that's why they call me slim shady (i'm back)
i'm back (i'm back), i'm back (slim shady!)

i'm back (i'm back), i'm back (slim shady!)
that's why they call me slim shady (i'm back)
i'm back (i'm back), i'm back (back) (slim shady!)


i take seven {kids} from {columbine}, stand 'em all in line
add an ak-47, a revolver, a .9
a mac-11 and it oughta solve the problem of mine
and that's a whole school of bullies shot up all at one time (ahh-! ahh-ahh-!)
'cause i'm shady, they call me as crazy
as the world was over this whole y2k thing
and by the way, nsync, why do they sing?
am i the only one who realizes they stink?
should i dye my hair pink and care what y'all think
lip sync and buy a bigger size of earrings?
it's why i tend to block out when i hear things
'cause all these fans screamin' is makin' my ears ring (ahh!)
so i just throw up a middle finger and let it linger
longer than the rumor that i was stickin' it to christina
'cause if i ever stuck it to any singer in showbiz
it'd be jennifer lopez and puffy, you know this
i'm sorry, puff, but i don't give a fuck
if this chick was my own mother, i'd still fuck her with no rubber
and cum inside her and have a son and a new brother
at the same time and just say that it ain't mine—what's my name?


i'm slim shady (*scratch*- slim, i'm back)
i'm back (i'm back), i'm back
that's why they call me slim shady (i'm back)
i'm back (*scratch*- i'm back), i'm back (i'm- *scratch*- i'm back)  (slim shady!)
that's why they call me slim shady (*scratches* slim, i'm back)
i'm back (i'm back), i'm back
they call me slim shady (i'm back)
i'm back (*scratch* i'm back), i'm back


guess who's b-back, back

i'm blew out from this blunt (*sighs*) fuck

your mother... you fuckin' faggot
ayo, this next song is dedicated to the memory of erik schrody
rest in peace, we ain't forget about you, you fuckin' homo, we still remember


there once was a man who liked to jump around
(yeah)
but he got too old to jump up and down (so then what happened)
so he put the mic down and picked the guitar up (and then he what?)
started singin' the blues like there was no tomorrow
he left his boys in the house of pain
it was the wisest decision he ever made
but the dumbest thing that he could ever do
(is what?)
was try to buck a .380 on those that act shady
tell me now what you gonna do
(haha)


cause i remember all those years, how it was when you were here (c'mon)
i remember how it was,(what) how it was when you were young
yesterday was so long ago, kid rock and limp bizkit came along now
don't nobody wanna hear your old ass sing no more


i remember back when you had the knack
and i remember when you had your first heart attack
i was right there laughin' when i heard the news
i just wish the cardiac woulda murdered you (damn)
maybe ice-t's right, you are a bitch (maybe he's right)
you come around when you're broke and you leave when you're rich
but the dumbest thing that you could ever do
(is what?)
was try to buck a 380 on those that act shady
tell me now what you gonna do


cause i remember all those years, how it was when you were here
i remember how it was, (what) how it was when you were young
yesterday was so long ago, kid rock and limp bizkit came along now
don't nobody wanna hear your old ass sing no more


remember back in '94, like right before ms. everlast was whitey ford
before his heart attack had him on life support
when house of pain was outta fame like someone doused the flame
and they became destined to never jump around again
or even further back, when i first had heard "the knack"
and you were down with syndicate, i went to get your shit, man i was into it
but then you went and took your style and switched the shit
now you sound ridiculous, you dickless piece of shit
how could you diss me, bitch?
i liked you, thought you was alright for a white dude
remember sway and tech when i came up and sat beside you
started rhymin, then you left the room and didn't say goodbye or nothin'?
like you mad that someone else was white and tried to rhyme or somethin
i'm sorry man, i wasn't tryin to steal your light or nothin
but you're a homosexual, white rappin irish (muslim)
man i wish i was irish, i could be a *muslim* too
then i'd be confused as you, and i wouldn't know what to do
what's up with you? i never fucked with you, why would you fuck with me?
knowin' i could rap circles around you, what, are you as nuts as me?
plus i can sing better than you and i don't fuckin' sing
and probably play guitar better, and i ain't never touched a string
but i ain't mad at you, i'd hate me too if i was you
i'm what you used to be, shit you was me in '92
so everytime i write a lyric, i'mma think of you
and maybe that will help me know what it's like to sing the blues


cause i remember all those years, how it was when you were here
i remember how it was, how it was when you were young
yesterday was so long ago, kid rock and limp bizkit came along now
don't nobody wanna hear your old ass sing no more
cause i remember all those years, how it was when you were here
i remember how it was, how it was when you were young
yesterday was so long ago, kid rock and limp bizkit came along now
don't nobody wanna hear your old ass sing no more


fuckin' punk pussy

when i was just a little baby boy my momma used to
tell me these crazy things
she used to tell me my daddy was an evil man
she used to tell me he hated me
but then i got a little bit older and i realized
she was the crazy one
but there was nothin' i could do or say to try to change it
'cause that's just the way she was


they said i can't rap about bein' broke no more
they ain't say i can't rap about coke no more (ahh)
slut, you think i won't choke no whore
'til the vocal cords won't work in her throat no more? (ahh)
these motherfuckers are thinkin' i'm playin'
thinkin' i'm sayin' this shit 'cause i'm thinkin' it just to be sayin' it (ahh)
put your hands down, bitch—i ain't gon' shoot you
i'ma pull you to this bullet and put it through you (ahh)
shut up, slut! you're causin' too much chaos
just bend over and take it like a slut—okay, ma?
"oh, now he's rapin' his own mother
abusin' a whore, snortin' coke and we gave him the rolling stone cover?"
you goddamn right, bitch, and now it's too late
i'm triple platinum and tragedies happened in two states
i invented violence, you vile venomous volatile vicious
vain vicodin, *vrin vrin vrin!*
texas chainsaw, left his brains all
danglin' from his neck while his head barely hangs on
blood, guts, guns, cuts
knives, lives, wives, nuns, sluts


bitch, i'ma kill you! you don't wanna fuck with me
girls neither, you ain't nothin' but a slut to me
bitch, i'ma kill you! you ain't got the balls to beef
we ain't gon' never stop beefin', i don't squash the beef
you better kill me, i'ma be another rapper dead
for poppin' off at the mouth with shit i shouldn't have said
but when they kill me, i'm bringin' the world with me
bitches too, you ain't nuttin' but a girl to me (i said)


you don't wanna fuck with
shady ('cause why?)
'cause shady will fuckin'
kill you (ah, haha)
i said you don't wanna fuck with
shady (why?)
'cause shady will fuckin'
kill you (bitch, i'ma kill you!)


like a murder weapon, i'ma conceal you
in a closet with mildew, sheets, pillows, and film you
fuck with me, i been through hell, shut the hell up
i'm tryna develop these pictures of the devil to sell 'em
i ain't "acid rap," but i rap on acid
got a new blow-up doll and just had a strap-on added
whoops! is that a subliminal hint? no!
just criminal intent to sodomize women again
eminem offend? no, eminem'll insult
and if you ever give in to him, you give him an impulse
to do it again, then if he does it again
you'll probably end up jumpin' out of somethin' up on the tenth (ahh)
bitch, i'ma kill you! i ain't done, this ain't the chorus
i ain't even drug you in the woods yet to paint the forest
a bloodstain is orange after you wash it

she don't need to see what i'm 'bout to do!
quit crying, bitch! why do you always make me shout at you?!
how could you just leave me and love him out the blue?!
oh, what's the matter, kim? am i too loud for you?
too bad, bitch! you're gonna finally hear me out this time!
at first i'm like, "aight, you wanna throw me out? that's fine!"
but not for him to take my place, are you out your mind?!
this couch, this tv, this whole house is mine!
how could you let him sleep in our bed?! look it, kim!
look at your husband now! (no!) i said look at him!
he ain't so hot now, is he?
little punk!
(why are you doing this?!) shut the fuck up! (you're drunk!)
(you're never gonna get away with this!) you think i give a fuck?!
come on! we're going for a ride, bitch! (no!) sit up front!
(we can't just leave hailie alone, what if she wakes up?)
we'll be right back, well, i will, you'll be in the trunk


so long, bitch, you did me so wrong
i don't wanna go on
living in this world without you
so long, bitch, you did me so wrong
i don't wanna go on
living in this world without you


you really fucked me, kim, you really did a number on me!
never knew me cheating on you would come back to haunt me
but we was kids then, kim, i was only eighteen
that was years ago, i thought we wiped the slate clean

and you were, like, so drunk that you threw up all over archie?
that was funny, wasn't it? (yes)
that was funny, wasn't it?! (yes!)
see, it all makes sense, doesn't it?
you and your husband have a fight, one of you tries to grab a knife
and during the struggle he accidentally gets his adam's apple sliced (no!)
and while this is going on, his son just woke up
and he walks in, she panics, and he gets his throat cut
(oh my god!)  so now they both dead
and you slash your own throat
so now it's double homicide and suicide with no note
i shoulda known better when you started to act weird

you're only making this harder on yourself!
ha-ha, gotcha! go ahead, yell!
here, i'll scream with you, "ah! somebody help!"

take shots at me (take shots at me)


yo
you might see me joggin', you might see me walkin'
you might see me walkin' a dead rottweiler dog
with its head chopped off in the park with a spiked collar
hollerin' at him 'cause the son of a bitch won't quit barkin' (ruff ruff)
or leanin' out a window with a cocked shotgun
drivin' up the block in the car that they shot pac in
lookin' for big's killers, dressin' ridiculous
blue and red, like i don't see what the big deal is
double barrel 12-gauge bigger than chris wallace
pissed off 'cause biggie and pac just missed all this
watchin' all these cheap imitations get rich off 'em
and get dollars that shoulda been theirs like they switched wallets
and amidst all this crist' poppin' and wristwatches
i just sit back and just watch and just get nauseous
and walk around with an empty bottle of rémy martin
startin' shit like some twenty-six-year-old skinny cartman (goddamn it!)
an anti-backstreet and ricky martin
whose instinct's to kill *nsync, don't get me started
these fuckin' brats can't sing and britney's garbage
what's this bitch, retarded? give me back my sixteen dollars!
all i see is sissies in magazines smilin'
whatever happened to wilin' out and bein' violent?
whatever happened to catchin' a good old-fashioned passionate ass-whoopin'
and gettin' your shoes, coat and your hat tooken?


new kids on the block suck a lot of dick
boy, girl groups make me sick
and i can't wait 'til i catch all you faggots in public
i'ma love it (hahaha)


vanilla ice don't like me (uh-uh), he said some shit in vibe to spite me (yo)
then went and dyed his hair just like me (haha)
a bunch of little kids wanna swear just like me
and run around screamin' "i don't care, just bite me!" (na-na)
i think i was put here to annoy the world
and destroy your little four-year-old boy or girl
plus i was put here to put fear in faggots who spray faygo root beer
and call themselves clowns 'cause they look queer (hehe)
faggy 2 dope and silent gay
claimin' detroit, when y'all live twenty miles away (fuckin' punks)
and i don't wrestle, i'll knock you fuckin' faggots the fuck out
aks 'em about the club they was at when they snuck out
after they ducked out the back when they saw us and bugged out (ah!)
ducked down and got paintballs shot at they truck — blaow!
look at y'all runnin' your mouth again
when you ain't seen a fuckin' mile road south of 10
and i don't need help from d12 to beat up two females
in make-up who may try to scratch me with lee nails
"slim anus"? you damn right, slim anus
i don't get fucked in mine like you two little flamin' faggots


'cause i'm just marshall
mathers (marshall mathers)
i'm not a wrestler guy, i'll knock you out
if you talk about me (talk about me)
come and see me on the streets alone if you assholes
doubt me (assholes doubt me)
and if you wanna run your mouth then come take your best shot
at me (best shot at me)


is it because you love me that y'all expect so much of me?
you little groupie bitch, get off me, go fuck puffy
now because of this blonde mop that's on top
of this fucked up head that i've got, i've gone pop?
the underground just spunned around and did a three-sixty
now these kids diss me and act like some big sissies
"oh, he just did some shit with missy
so now he thinks he's too big to do some shit with mc get-bizzy"
my fuckin' bitch mom's suin' for ten-million
she must want a dollar for every pill i've been stealin'
shit, where the fuck you think i picked up the habit?
all i had to do was go in her room and lift up her mattress
which is it, bitch: mrs. briggs or ms. mathers?
it doesn't matter, **** ******** **** ******'* * faggot
talkin' about i fabricated my past
he's just aggravated i won't ejaculate in his ass (ugh!)
so tell me, what the hell is a fella to do?
for every million i make, another relative sues
family fightin' and fussin' over who wants to invite me to supper
all of a sudden, i got ninety-some cousins (hey, it's me!)
a half-brother and sister who never seen me
or even bothered to call me until they saw me on tv
now everybody's so happy and proud
i'm finally allowed to step foot in my girlfriend's house (hey!)
and then to top it off i walked to the newsstand
to buy this cheap-ass little magazine with a food stamp
skipped to the last page, flipped right fast
and what do i see? a picture of my big white ass
okay, let me give you motherfuckers some help, uh, here
"xxl! xxl!"
now your magazine shouldn't have so much trouble to sell
aw, fuck it, i'll even buy a couple myself

bust in the air and hit a airplane pilot
we clowned you, rap surround sounds around you
from ten-speed and brown shoe
doc and eminem, cock the m&m
blood flows with 2pacalypse and them


it's like, funk doctor meets the punk rocker
got the drugs stocked inside the lunch box (uhh)
pop junk like i just got jumped
popped the trunk and pulled out the shotgun pump
knock wood, it's all good; thank god for vodka
'cause with my luck, i'll probably get shot by a stalker (ckkk!)
probably got a fanatic waitin' upstairs in the attic
with a automatic callin' me up there (watch up!)
my man, stan, with a gat in his hand
stakin' my house out in a tan, tinted sedan
pull your mouth out till you can't finish a damn (yeah)

i'm even liked better by your niece and nephew! (c'mon!)
and now you hate fred! because lethal left you! (aw)
peckerwood mad, 'cause his record went wood
no respect in the hood, fled to his neck of the woods
got in touch with his roots, found the redneck in his blood
and said, "heck, country-western rap records are good"
so he picks the guitar up and he strums a few notes
he can't rap, or sing, but he wants to do both (haha)
puts an album out and rules for part of the year
then kid rock and limp bizkit come from out of nowhere
it's the start of an era, rock rap's harder this year
no one's tryin' to hear some fuckin' old fart in a chair
sittin' on stage, strummin' acoustic guitar in your ear
so you start to get scared, sit back and spark an idea
figure you can diss me to jump start your career?
i punch you in your fuckin' chest, 'til your heart kicks in gear!(bitch)
and fuck your underground buddies' nameless crew
like i'ma say they names, so they can be famous too

back in '94, limp opened the show for you!
rocked the crowd better and stole the whole show from you
took your motherfuckin' dj and stole him too!
so you fall in a slump and get all emotional
so now you sing and mix slang with blues and pluck strings
confused as fuck! 'cause now your music sucks dick!
mr.-mr. ass kisser to get accepted in rap quicker
but never last, and everlast is a


quitter and you bitter, 'cause i came along
and the days of house of pain are gone

i'm sorry, i'm sorry, i promise
i just believe in kickin' a man while he's down
goddamn! i quit!
mention my daughter's name in a song again, you fuckin' punk ayo!

dear slim, i wrote you, but you still ain't callin'
i left my cell, my pager and my home phone at the bottom
i sent two letters back in autumn, you must not've got 'em
there probably was a problem at the post office or somethin'
sometimes i scribble addresses too sloppy when i jot 'em
but anyways, fuck it, what's been up, man? how's your daughter?
my girlfriend's pregnant too, i'm 'bout to be a father
if i have a daughter, guess what i'ma call her? i'ma name her bonnie
i read about your uncle ronnie too, i'm sorry
i had a friend kill himself over some bitch who didn't want him
i know you probably hear this every day, but i'm your biggest fan
i even got the underground shit that you did with skam
i got a room full of your posters and your pictures, man
i like the shit you did with rawkus too, that shit was phat
anyways, i hope you get this, man, hit me back
just to chat, truly yours, your biggest fan, this is stan


dear slim, you still ain't called or wrote, i hope you have a chance
i ain't mad, i just think it's fucked up you don't answer fans
if you didn't want to talk to me outside your concert, you didn't have to
but you coulda signed an autograph for matthew
that's my little brother, man, he's only six years old
we waited in the blisterin' cold for you, for four hours, and you just said, "no"
that's pretty shitty, man, you're like his fuckin' idol
he wants to be just like you, man, he likes you more than i do
i ain't that mad, though i just don't like bein' lied to
remember when we met in denver? you said if i'd write you, you would write back
see, i'm just like you in a way: i never knew my father neither
he used to always cheat on my mom and beat her
i can relate to what you're sayin' in your songs
so when i have a shitty day, i drift away and put 'em on
'cause i don't really got shit else, so that shit helps when i'm depressed
i even got a tattoo with your name across the chest
sometimes i even cut myself to see how much it bleeds
it's like adrenaline, the pain is such a sudden rush for me
see, everything you say is real, and i respect you 'cause you tell it
my girlfriend's jealous 'cause i talk about you 24/7
but she don't know you like i know you, slim, no one does
she don't know what it was like for people like us growin' up
you gotta call me, man, i'll be the biggest fan you'll ever lose
sincerely yours, stan—p.s. we should be together too


dear mr. i'm-too-good-to-call-or-write-my-fans
this'll be the last package i ever send your ass
it's been six months, and still no word—i don't deserve it?
i know you got my last two letters, i wrote the addresses on 'em perfect
so this is my cassette i'm sendin' you, i hope you hear it
i'm in the car right now, i'm doin' ninety on the freeway
hey, slim, i drank a fifth of vodka, you dare me to drive?
you know the song by phil collins, "in the air of the night"
about that guy who coulda saved that other guy from drownin'
but didn't, then phil saw it all, then at a show he found him?
that's kinda how this is: you coulda rescued me from drownin'
now it's too late, i'm on a thousand downers now—i'm drowsy
and all i wanted was a lousy letter or a call
i hope you know i ripped all of your pictures off the wall
i loved you, slim, we coulda been together—think about it!
you ruined it now, i hope you can't sleep and you dream about it
and when you dream, i hope you can't sleep and you scream about it
i hope your conscience eats at you and you can't breathe without me
see, slim—shut up, bitch! i'm tryin' to talk
hey, slim, that's my girlfriend screamin' in the trunk
but i didn't slit her throat, i just tied her up—see? i ain't like you
'cause if she suffocates she'll suffer more and then she'll die too
well, gotta go, i'm almost at the bridge now
oh, shit, i forgot—how am i supposed to send this shit out?!


dear stan, i meant to write you sooner, but i just been busy
you said your girlfriend's pregnant now, how far along is she?
look, i'm really flattered you would call your daughter that
and here's an autograph for your brother; i wrote it on a starter cap
i'm sorry i didn't see you at the show, i must've missed you
don't think i did that shit intentionally just to diss you
but what's this shit you said about you like to cut your wrists too?
i say that shit just clownin', dawg, come on, how fucked up is you?
you got some issues, stan, i think you need some counselin'
to help your ass from bouncin' off the walls when you get down some
and what's this shit about us meant to be together?
that type of shit'll make me not want us to meet each other
i really think you and your girlfriend need each other
or maybe you just need to treat her better
i hope you get to read this letter, i just hope it reaches you in time
before you hurt yourself, i think that you'll be doin' just fine
if you relax a little, i'm glad i inspire you, but stan
why are you so mad? try to understand that i do want you as a fan
i just don't want you to do some crazy shit
i seen this one shit on the news a couple weeks ago that made me sick
some dude was drunk and drove his car over a bridge
and had his girlfriend in the trunk, and she was pregnant with his kid
and in the car they found a tape, but they didn't say who it was to
come to think about it, his name was—it was you
damn...

dear slim, i wrote you, but you still ain't callin'
i left my cell, my pager and my home phone at the bottom
i sent two letters back in autumn, you must not've got 'em
there probably was a problem at the post office or somethin'
sometimes i scribble addresses too sloppy when i jot 'em
but anyways, ... ..., what's been up, man? how's your daughter?
my girlfriend's pregnant too, i'm 'bout to be a father
if i have a daughter, guess what i'ma call her?
i'ma name her bonnie
i read about your uncle ronnie too, i'm sorry
i had a friend ... ...  over some ...  who didn't want him
i know you probably hear this every day, but i'm your biggest fan
i even got the underground ... that you did with skam
i got a room full of your posters and your pictures, man
i like the ...  you did with rawkus too, that ... was phat
anyways, i hope you get this, man, hit me back
just to chat, truly yours, your biggest fan, this is stan


dear slim, you still ain't called or wrote, i hope you have a chance
i ain't mad, i just think it's ... ... you don't answer fans
if you didn't want to talk to me outside your concert, you didn't have to
but you coulda signed an autograph for matthew
that's my little brother, man, he's only six years old
we waited in the blisterin' cold
for you, for four hours, and you just said no
that's pretty ..., man, you're like his ... idol
he wants to be just like you, man, he likes you more than i do
i ain't that mad, though i just don't like bein' lied to
remember when we met in denver?
you said if i'd write you, you would write back
see, i'm just like you in a way: i never knew my father neither
he used to always cheat on my mom ... ... ...
i can relate to what you're sayin' in your songs
so when i have a ... day, i drift away and put 'em on
‘cause i don't really got ... else
so that ... helps when i'm depressed
i even got a tattoo with your name across the chest
...
it's like adrenaline, the pain is such a sudden rush for me
see, everything you say is real, and i respect you ‘cause you tell it
my girlfriend's jealous 'cause i talk about you 24/7
but she don't know you like i know you, slim, no one does
she don't know what it was like for people like us growin' up
you gotta call me, man, i'll be the biggest fan you'll ever lose
sincerely yours, stan—p.s. we should be together too


dear mr. i'm-too-good-to-call-or-write-my-fans
this'll be the last package i ever send your ...
it's been six months, and still no word—i don't deserve it?
i know you got my last two letters, i wrote the addresses on 'em perfect
so this is my cassette i'm sendin' you, i hope you hear it
i'm in the car right now, i'm doin' 90 on the freeway
hey, slim..., you dare me to drive?
you know the song by phil collins, "in the air of the night"
about that guy who coulda saved that other guy from ...
but didn't, then phil saw it all, then at a show he found him?
that's kinda how this is: you coulda rescued me from ...
now it's too late, i'm on a thousand downers now—i'm drowsy
and all i wanted was a lousy letter or a call
i hope you know i ripped all of your pictures off the wall
i loved you, slim, we coulda been together—think about it!
you ruined it now, ...sleep and you dream about it
and when you dream ...sleep and you scream about it
...
see, slim—shut up, ... i'm tryin' to talk
hey, slim...
but... —see? i ain't like you
...
well, gotta go, i'm almost at the bridge now
oh, ..., i forgot—how am i supposed to send this ... out?!

****…

and everyone should get along
okay, children, quiet down, quiet down
children, i'd like to introduce our new substitute teacher for the day
his name is mr. shady
children, quiet down please
brian, don't throw that (shut up!)
mr. shady will be your new substitute while mr. kaniff is out with pneumonia (he's got aids!)
good luck, mr. shady!


hi there, little boys and girls! (fuck you!)
today we're gonna learn how to poison squirrels
but first, i'd like you to meet my friend bob (huh?)
say hi, bob ("hi, bob!")
bob's thirty and still lives with his mom
and he don't got a job 'cause bob sits at home and smokes pot
but his twelve-year-old brother looks up to him an awful lot
and bob likes to hang out at the local waffle spot
and wait in the parking lot for waitresses off the clock
when it's late and the lot gets dark and fake like he walks his dog
drag 'em in the woods and go straight to the chopping block (ahh!)
and even if they escaped and they got the cops
the ladies would all be so afraid, they would drop the charge
'til one night mrs. stacey went off the job
when she felt someone grab her whole face and said not to talk
but stacey knew it was bob and said, "knock it off!"
but bob wouldn't knock it off, 'cause he's crazy and off his rocker
crazier than slim shady is off the vodka
you couldn't even take him to dre's to get bob a doctor
he grabbed stace by the legs as he chopped it off her
and dropped her off in the lake for the cops to find her
but ever since the day stacey went off to wander
they never found her, and bob still hangs at the waffle diner
and that's the story of bob and his marijuana
and what it might do to you
so see if the squirrels want it—it's bad for you


see, children, drugs are bad (come on)
and if you don't believe me, ask your dad (you can ask)
and if you don't believe him, ask your mom (that's right)
she'll tell you how she does 'em all the time (she will)
so kids, say no to drugs (that's right)
so you don't act like everyone else does (uh-huh)
and there's really nothin' else to say (sing along)
drugs are just bad, mmkay?


my penis is the size of a peanut, have you seen it?
fuck no, you ain't seen it! it's the size of a peanut! (huh?)
speakin' of peanuts, you know what else is bad for squirrels?
ecstasy is the worst drug in the world
if someone ever offers it to you, don't do it
kids, two hits'll probably drain all your spinal fluid
and spinal fluid is final, you won't get it back
so don't get attached, it'll attack every bone in your back
meet zach: twenty-one years old
after hangin' out with some friends at a frat party, he gets bold
and decides to try five when he's bribed by five guys
and peer pressure will win every time you try to fight it
suddenly, he starts to convulse
and his pulse goes into hyperdrive
and his eyes roll back in his skull (blblblblblb)
his back starts to look like the mcdonald's arches
he's on donald's carpet, layin' horizontal, barfin' (bleh)
and everyone in the apartment starts laughin' at him
"hey adam, zach is a jackass, look at him!"
'cause they took it too, so they think it's funny
so they're laughing at basically nothing
except maybe wasting their money
meanwhile, zach's in a coma, the action is over
and his back and his shoulders hunched up like he's practicin' yoga
and that's the story of zach, the ecstasy maniac
so don't even feed that to squirrels, class, 'cause it's bad for you


see, children, drugs are bad (that's right)
and if you don't believe me, ask your dad (that's right)
and if you don't believe him, ask your mom (you can)
she'll tell you how she does 'em all the time (she will)
so kids, say no to drugs (smoke crack)
so you don't act like everyone else does (that's right)
and there's really nothin' else to say (right on)
drugs are just bad, mmkay?


and last but not least, one of the most humongous
problems among young people today is fungus
it grows from cow manure; they pick it out, wipe it off, bag it up
and you put it right in your mouth and chew it
yum-yum! then you start to see some dumb stuff
and everything slows down when you eat some of 'em
and sometimes, you see things that aren't there (like what?)
like fat women in g-strings with orange hair
(mr. shady, what's a g-string?) it's yarn, claire
women stick 'em up their behinds, go out and wear 'em (huh?)
and if you swallow too much of the magic mushrooms
whoops, did i say 'magic mushrooms?' i meant fungus
your tongue gets all swole up like a cow's tongue
(how come?) 'cause it comes from a cow's dung (gross!)
see, drugs are bad, it's a common fact
but your mom and dad know that's all that i'm good at (eh?)
but don't be me, 'cause if you grow up and you go and od
they're gonna come for me, and i'ma have to grow a goatee
and get a disguise and hide, 'cause it'll be my fault
so don't do drugs, and do exactly as i don't, 'cause i'm bad for you


see, children, drugs are bad (uh-huh)
and if you don't believe me, ask your dad (put that down!)
and if you don't believe him, ask your mom (you can ask)
she'll tell you how she does 'em all the time (and she will)
so kids, say no to drugs (say no)
so you don't act like everyone else does (like i do)
and there's really nothin' else to say (that's right)
drugs are just bad, mmkay?


come on, children, clap along! (shut up!)
sing along, children! (suck my motherfuckin' dick!)
come on, clap along
drugs are just bad, drugs are just bad (south park is gonna sue me!)
so don't do drugs! (kiss my motherfuckin' ass!)
so there'll be more for me (hippie! goddamn it!)
(mushrooms killed kenny!)
(uh, the fart button's on) (*fart*) (ew, ahh!)
la la la (so fucked up right now)

may i have your attention, please?
may i have your attention, please?
will the real slim shady please stand up?
i repeat
will the real slim shady please stand up?
we're gonna have a problem here


y'all act like you never seen a white person before
jaws all on the floor like pam, like tommy just burst in the door
and started whoopin' her ass worse than before
they first were divorced, throwin' her over furniture (agh!)
it's the return of the "oh, wait, no way, you're kidding
he didn't just say what i think he did, did he?"
and dr. dre said
nothing, you idiots, dr. dre's dead, he's locked in my basement (ha-ha!)
feminist women love eminem
"chicka-chicka-chicka, slim shady, i'm sick of him
look at him, walkin' around, grabbin' his you-know-what
flippin' the you-know-who", "yeah, but he's so cute though"
yeah, i probably got a couple of screws up in my head loose
but no worse than what's goin' on in your parents' bedrooms
sometimes i wanna get on tv and just let loose
but can't, but it's cool for tom green to hump a dead moose
"my bum is on your lips, my bum is on your lips"
and if i'm lucky, you might just give it a little kiss
and that's the message that we deliver to little kids
and expect them not to know what a woman's clitoris is
of course, they're gonna know what intercourse is
by the time they hit fourth grade they've got the discovery channel, don't they?
we ain't nothin' but mammals
well, some of us cannibals who cut other people open like cantaloupes
but if we can hump dead animals and antelopes
then there's no reason that a man and another man can't elope
but if you feel like i feel, i got the antidote
women, wave your pantyhose, sing the chorus, and it goes


i'm slim shady, yes, i'm the real shady
all you other slim shadys are just imitating
so won't the real slim shady please stand up
please stand up, please stand up?
'cause i'm slim shady, yes, i'm the real shady
all you other slim shadys are just imitating
so won't the real slim shady please stand up
please stand up, please stand up?


will smith don't gotta cuss in his raps to sell records (nope)
well, i do, so fuck him, and fuck you too
you think i give a damn about a grammy?
half of you critics can't even stomach me, let alone stand me
"but slim, what if you win? wouldn't it be weird?"
why? so you guys could just lie to get me here?
so you can sit me here next to britney spears?
yo, shit, christina aguilera better switch me chairs
so i can sit next to carson daly and fred durst
and hear 'em argue over who she gave head to first
little bitch put me on blast on mtv
"yeah, he's cute, but i think he's married to kim, hee-hee"
i should download her audio on mp3
and show the whole world how you gave eminem vd (agh!)
i'm sick of you little girl and boy groups, all you do is annoy me
so i have been sent here to destroy you
and there's a million of us just like me
who cuss like me, who just don't give a fuck like me
who dress like me, walk, talk and act like me
and just might be the next best thing, but not quite me


'cause i'm slim shady, yes, i'm the real shady
all you other slim shadys are just imitating
so won't the real slim shady please stand up

all you other slim shadys are just imitating
so won't the real slim shady please stand up
please stand up, please stand up?


i'm like a head trip to listen to 'cause i'm only givin' you
things you joke about with your friends inside your livin' room
the only difference is i got the balls to say it in front of y'all
and i don't gotta be false or sugarcoat it at all
i just get on the mic and spit it
and whether you like to admit it (err), i just shit it
better than ninety percent of you rappers out can
then you wonder: "how can kids eat up these albums like valiums?"
it's funny, 'cause at the rate i'm goin', when i'm thirty
i'll be the only person in the nursin' home flirting
pinchin' nurse's asses when i'm jacking off with jergens
and i'm jerking, but this whole bag of viagra isn't working
and every single person is a slim shady lurkin'
he could be working at burger king, spittin' on your onion rings (ch, puh)
or in the parkin' lot, circling, screaming, "i don't give a fuck!"
with his windows down and his system up
so will the real shady please stand up
and put one of those fingers on each hand up?
and be proud to be outta your mind and outta control
and one more time, loud as you can, how does it go?


i'm slim shady, yes, i'm the real shady

ha ha, i guess there’s a slim shady in all of us
---- it, let’s all stand up



may i have your attention please?
may i have your attention please?
will the real slim shady please stand up?
i repeat, will the real slim shady please stand up?
we're gonna have a problem here


y'all act like you've never seen a while person before
jaws all on the floor like pam and tommy just burst in the door
started whooping her --- worse than before
they first werе divorced, throwing her over furniturе (ah!)
it's the return of the "aw, wait, no way, you're kidding. he didn't just say what i think he did, did he?"
and dr. dre said...nothing you idiots, dr. dre's dead, he's locked in my
basement (ha-ha)
feminist women love eminem, "chicka-chikca-chikca, slim shady, i'm sick of him. look at him! walking around grabbing his you know what
flipping the you know who." "yeah, but he's so cute though!"
yeah, i probably got a couple of screws up in my head loose
but no worse than what's going on in your parents bedrooms
sometimes i wanna get on tv and just let loose
but can't, but it's cool for tom green to --- a dead moose
my --- is on your lips, my --- is on your lips, and if i'm lucky you might just give it a little kiss
and that's the message that we deliver to little kids and expect them not to know what a womans --- is
of course they're gonna know what --- is by the time they hit 4th grade
they got the discovery channel, don't they?
we ain't nothing but mammals, well some of us cannibals who cut other people open like cantaloups
but if we can --- dead animals and antelopes, then there's no reason that a man and another man can't elope (ewwhh)
but if you feel like i feel, i got the antidote
women, wave your pantyhose sing the chorus, and it goes


i'm slim shady, yes, i'm the real shady
all you other slim shady's are just imitating
so, won't the real slim shady please stand up?
please stand up?
please stand up?
cause, i'm slim shady, yes, i'm the real shady
all you other slim shady's are just imitating
so, won't the real slim shady please stand up?
please stand up?
please stand up?


will smith don't gotta cuss in his raps to sell records
well, i do, so --- him and --- you too
you think i give a --- about a grammy?
half of you critics and even stomach me, let alone stand me
"but slim, what if you win? wouldn't it be weird?"
why, so you guys could just lie to get me here?
so you could sit me here next to britney spears?
christina aguilera better switch me chairs
so i can sit next to carson daly and fred durst
and hear them argue over who she gave --- to first
lil --- put me on blast on mtv
"yeah, he's cute, but i think he's married to kim. hee-hee!"
i should download an audio on mp3 and show the whole world how you gave eminem --
i'm sick of you little girl and boy groups all you do is annoy me
so i have been sent here to destroy you
and there's a million of us just like me
who cuss like me
who just don't give a --- like me
who dress like me
walk, talk, and act like me
it just might be the next best thing, but not quite me


cause, i'm slim shady, yes, i'm the real shady
all you other slim shady's are just imitating
so, won't the real slim shady please stand up?
please stand up?
please stand up?
cause, i'm slim shady, yes, i'm the real shady
all you other slim shady's are just imitating
so, won't the real slim shady please stand up?
please stand up?
please stand up?


i'm like a head trip to listen to, cause i'm only giving you things you joke about with your friends inside your living room
the only difference is i got the --- to say it in front of y'all and i don't gotta be false and sugarcoat it  at all
i just get on the mic and spit it
and whether you like to admit it (errr)
i just --- it better than 90% of you rappers out can
then you wonder, how can kids eat up these albums like ---?
it's funny, cause at the rate i'm going, when i'm 30 thirty
i'll be the only person in the nursing home flirting
punching nurses --- when i'm --- off with jergens
and i'm --- but this whole bag of --- isn't working
and every single person is a slim shady lerking
he could be working at burger king spitting on your onion rings
or in a parking lot, circling, screaming "i don't give a ---!" with his windows down and his system up
so will the real shady please stand up?
and put one of those fingers on each hand up?
and to be proud to be out of your mind and out of control
one more time, loud as you can, how does it go?


i'm slim shady, yes, i'm the real shady
all you other slim shady's are just imitating
so, won't the real slim shady please stand up?
please stand up?
please stand up?
cause, i'm slim shady, yes, i'm the real shady

haha, guess there's a slim shady in all of us
--- it, let's all stand up



dre, just let it run
ayo, turn the beat up a little bit
ayo
this song is for anyone
fuck it, just shut up and listen
ayo

i sit back with this pack of zig-zag's and this bag
of this weed, it gives me the shit needed to be
the most meanest mc on this, on this earth
and since birth i've been cursed with this curse to just curse
and just blurt this berserk and bizarre shit that works
and it sells and it helps in itself to relieve
all this tension, dispensin' these sentences
gettin' this stress that's been eatin' me recently off
of this chest and i rest again peacefully
but at least have the decency in you
to leave me alone, when you freaks see me out
in the streets when i'm eatin' or feedin' my daughter
to not come and speak to me
i don't know you, and no, i don't owe you a motherfuckin' thing
i'm not mr. *nsync, i'm not what your friends think
i'm not mr. friendly, i can be a prick
if you tempt me, my tank is on empty
no patience is in me and if you offend me
i'm liftin' you ten feet in the air
i don't care who was there and who saw me just jaw you
go call you a lawyer, file you a lawsuit
i'll smile in the courtroom and buy you a wardrobe
i'm tired of all you, i don't mean to be mean
but that's all i can be, it's just me


and i am whatever you say i am
if i wasn't, then why would i say i am?
in the paper, the news, every day i am
ha, radio won't even play my jam
'cause i am whatever you say i am
if i wasn't, then why would i say i am?
in the paper, the news, every day i am
ha, i don't know, that's just the way i am


sometimes i just feel like my father, i hate to be bothered
with all of this nonsense, it's constant
and, "oh, it's his lyrical content
the song 'guilty conscience' has gotten such rotten responses"
and all of this controversy circles me
and it seems like the media immediately
points a finger at me
so i point one back at 'em, but not the index or pinkie
or the ring or the thumb, it's the one you put up
when you don't give a fuck, when you won't just put up
with the bullshit they pull, 'cause they full of shit too
when a dude's gettin' bullied and shoots up his school
and they blame it on marilyn and the heroin
where were the parents at? and look where it's at!
middle america, now it's a tragedy
now it's so sad to see, an upper-class city
havin' this happenin', then attack
eminem 'cause i rap this way, but i'm glad
'cause they feed me the fuel that i need for the fire to burn
and it's burnin', and i have returned


and i am whatever you say i am
if i wasn't, then why would i say i am?
in the paper, the news, every day i am
radio won't even play my jam
'cause i am whatever you say i am
if i wasn't, then why would i say i am?
in the paper, the news, every day i am
ha, i don't know, that's just the way i am


i'm so sick and tired of bein' admired
that i wish that i would just die or get fired
and dropped from my label, let's stop with the fables
i'm not gonna be able to top a "my name is"
and pigeon-holed into some poppy sensation
to cop me rotation at rock 'n' roll stations
and i just do not got the patience
to deal with these cocky caucasians who think
i'm some wigger who just tries to be black 'cause i talk
with an accent and grab on my balls so they always
keep askin' the same fuckin' questions
what school did i go to, what hood i grew up in
the why, the who, what, when, the where, and the how
'til i'm grabbin' my hair and i'm tearin' it out (argh!)
'cause they drivin' me crazy, i can't take it
i'm racin', i'm pacin', i stand and i sit
and i'm thankful for every fan that i get
but i can't take a shit in the bathroom without
someone standin' by it! no, i won't sign your autograph
you can call me an asshole, i'm glad


'cause i am whatever you say i am
if i wasn't, then why would i say i am?
in the paper, the news, every day i am
radio won't even play my jam
'cause i am whatever you say i am
if i wasn't, then why would i say i am?
in the paper, the news, every day i am
ha, i don't know, that's just the way i am


(i never knew i, knew i, knew i)
(i never knew i, knew i, knew i) mic check, one-two
(i never knew i, knew i, knew i) who woulda knew?
(i never knew i, knew i, knew i) who woulda known?
(i never knew i, knew i, knew i) fuck would of thought?
(i never knew i, knew i, knew i) motherfucker comes out
(i never knew i, knew i, knew i) sells a couple of million records
(i never knew i, knew i, knew i) and these motherfuckers hit the ceiling
(i never knew i)

i don't do black music, i don't do white music (nope)
i make fight music for high school kids
i put lives at risk when i drive like this
i put wives at risk with a knife like this (ah!) (shit)
you probably think i'm in your tape deck now
i'm in the backseat of your truck with duct tape stretched out
ducked the fuck way down, waitin' to straight jump out
put it over your mouth, and grab you by the face — what now?
oh, you want me to watch my mouth? how?
take my fuckin' eyeballs out and turn 'em around? (look)
i'll burn your fuckin' house down, circle around
and hit the hydrant, so you can't put your burnin' furniture out (oh my god! oh my god!)
i'm sorry, there must be a mix-up
you want me to fix up lyrics while our president gets his dick sucked?
fuck that! take drugs, rape sluts
make fun of gay clubs, men who wear make-up
get aware, wake up, get a sense of humor
quit tryin' to censor music, this is for your kid's amusement (the kids!)
but don't blame me when little eric jumps off of the terrace
you shoulda been watchin' him, apparently you ain't parents


‘cause i never knew i, knew i would get this big
i never knew i, knew i'd affect this kid
i never knew i'd get him to slit his wrist
i never knew i'd get him to hit this bitch
i never knew i, knew i would get this big
i never knew i, knew i'd affect this kid
i never knew i'd get him to slit his wrist
i never knew i'd get him to hit this bitch

so who's bringin' the guns in this country? (hm?)
i couldn't sneak a plastic pellet gun through customs over in london
and last week i seen this schwarzenegger movie
where he's shootin' all sorts of these motherfuckers with a uzi
i see these three little kids up in the front row
screaming, "go!" with their seventeen-year-old uncle
i'm like, guidance?! ain't they got the same moms
and dads who got mad when i asked if they liked violence?
and told me that my tape taught 'em to swear?
what about the make-up you allow your twelve-year-old daughter to wear? (hm?)
so tell me that your son doesn't know any cuss words
when his bus driver's screamin' at him, fuckin' him up worse (go sit the fuck down, you little fucking prick!)
and "fuck" was the first word i ever learned
up in the third grade, flippin' the gym teacher the bird (look!)
so read up 'bout how i used to get beat up
peed on, be on free lunch and changed school every three months
my life's like kind of what my wife's like (what?)
fucked up after i beat her fuckin' ass every night: ike
so how much easier would life be if nineteen
million motherfuckers grew to be just like me?


‘cause i never knew i, knew i would get this big
i never knew i, knew i'd affect this kid
i never knew i'd get him to slit his wrist
i never knew i'd get him to hit this bitch
i never knew i, knew i would get this big
i never knew i, knew i'd affect this kid
i never knew i'd get him to slit his wrist
i never knew i'd get him to hit this bitch


i never knew i, knew i'd have a new house or a new car
a couple years ago, i was more poorer than you are
i don't got that bad of a mouth, do i?
fuck! shit! ass! bitch! cunt! shooby-de-doo-wop! (oops)
skibbedy-be-bop, a christopher reeves
sonny bono, skis, horses and hittin' some trees (hey)
how many retards'll listen to me
and run-up in the school shootin' when they're pissed at a tea-
-cher? her? him? is it you? is it them?
"wasn't me, slim shady said to do it again!"
damn, how much damage can you do with a pen?
man, i'm just as fucked up as you woulda been
if you woulda been in my shoes, who woulda thought
slim shady would be somethin' that you woulda bought?
that woulda made you get a gun and shoot at a cop
i just said it, i ain't know if you'd do it or not


‘cause i never knew i, knew i would get this big
i never knew i, knew i'd affect this kid
i never knew i'd get him to slit his wrist
i never knew i'd get him to hit this bitch
i never knew i, knew i would get this big
i never knew i, knew i'd affect this kid
i never knew i'd get him to slit his wrist
i never knew i'd get him to hit this bitch


how the fuck was i supposed to know?
