it's alright, it's okay
i'm gonna make it anyway
gonna make it, can't give up now
i'ma make it somehow


sometimes i just feel like quittin', i still might
why do i put up this fight? why do i still write?
sometimes it's hard enough just dealin' with real life
sometimes i wanna jump on stage and just kill mics
and show these people what my level of skill's like
but i'm still white, sometimes i just hate life
somethin' ain't right, hit the brake lights
case of the stage fright, drawin' a blank like
da-duh-duh-da-da, it ain't my fault
great big eyeballs, my insides crawl
and i clam up, i just slam shut
i just can't do it, my whole manhood's
just been stripped, i have just been 'vict'd
so i must then get off the bus then split
man, fuck this shit, yo, i'm goin' the fuck home
world on my shoulders as i run back to this 8 mile road


i'm a man, i'ma make a new plan
(it's alright, it's okay)
time for me to just stand up and travel new land
(i'm gonna make it anyway)
time for me to just take matters into my own hands
(gonna make it, can't give up now)
once i'm over these tracks, man, i'ma never look back
(i'ma make it somehow)
(8 mile road) and i'm gone, i know right where i'm goin'
(it's alright, it's okay)
sorry, momma, i'm grown, i must travel alone
(i'm gonna make it anyway)
ain't gon' follow no footsteps, i'm makin' my own
(gonna make it, can't give up now)
only way that i know how to escape from this 8 mile road
(i'ma make it somehow)


i'm walkin' these train tracks, tryna regain back
the spirit i had 'fore i go back to the same crap
to the same plant, in the same pants
tryna chase rap, gotta move asap
and get a new plan, momma's got a new man
poor little baby sister, she don't understand
sits in front of the tv, buries her nose in the pad
and just colors until the crayon gets dull in her hand
while she colors her big brother and mother and dad
ain't no tellin' what really goes on in her little head
wish i could be the daddy that neither one of us had
but i keep runnin' from somethin' i never wanted so bad
sometimes i get upset, ‘cause i ain't blew up yet
it's like i grew up, but i ain't grow me two nuts yet
don't gotta rep my step, don't got enough pep
the pressure's too much, man, i'm just tryna do what's best
and i try, sit alone and i cry
yo, i won't tell no lie, not a moment goes by
that i don't pray to the sky, please, i'm beggin' you, god
please don't let me be pigeonholed in no regular job
yo, i hope you can hear me, homie, wherever you are
yo, i'm tellin' you, dawg, i'm bailin' this trailer tomorrow
tell my mother i love her, kiss baby sister goodbye
say whenever you need me, baby, i'm never too far
but, yo, i gotta get out there, the only way i know
and i'ma be back for you the second that i blow
on everything i own, i'll make it on my own
off to work i go back to this 8 mile road


i'm a man, gotta make a new plan
(it's alright, it's okay)
time for me to just stand up and travel new land
(i'm gonna make it anyway)
time for me to just take matters into my own hands
(gonna make it, can't give up now)
once i'm over these tracks, man, i'ma never look back
(i'ma make it somehow)
(8 mile road) and i'm gone, i know right where i'm goin'
(it's alright, it's okay)
sorry, momma, i'm grown, i must travel alone
(i'm gonna make it anyway)
ain't gon' follow no footsteps, i'm makin' my own
(gonna make it, can't give up now)
only way that i know how to escape from this 8 mile road
(i'ma make it somehow)


you gotta live it to feel it; you didn't, you wouldn't get it
or see what the big deal is, why it was and it still is
to be walkin' this borderline of detroit city limits
it's different, it's a certain significance, a certificate
of authenticity, you'd never even see
but it's everything to me, it's my credibility
you never seen, heard, smelled or met a real mc
who's incredible or on the same pedestal as me
but yet i'm still unsigned, havin' a rough time
sit on the porch with all my friends and kick dumb rhymes
go to work and serve mcs in the lunchline
but when it comes crunch time, where do my punchlines go?
who must i show to bust my flow?
where must i go? who must i know?
or am i just another crab in the bucket?
‘cause i ain't havin' no luck with this little rabbit's foot, fuck it
maybe i need a new outlet, i'm startin' to doubt shit
i'm feelin' a little skeptical who i hang out with
i look like a bum, yo, my clothes ain't about shit
at the salvation army, tryna salvage an outfit
and it's cold, tryna travel this road
plus i feel like i'm always stuck in this battlin' mode
my defenses are so up, but one thing i don't want
is pity from no one, this city is no fun
there is no sun, and it's so dark
sometimes i feel like i'm just bein' pulled apart
from each one of my limbs, by each one of my friends
it's enough to just make me wanna jump out of my skin
sometimes i feel like a robot, sometimes i just know not
what i'm doin', i just blow, my head is a stove top
i just explode, the kettle gets so hot
sometimes my mouth just overloads the ass that i don't got
but i've learned, it's time for me to u-turn
yo, it only takes one time for me to get burned
ain't no fallin', no, next time i meet a new girl
i can no longer play stupid or be immature
i got every ingredient, all i need is the courage
like i already got the beat, all i need is the words
got the urge, suddenly it's a surge
suddenly a new burst of energy has occurred
time to show these free world leaders the three and a third
i am no longer scared now, i'm free as a bird
then i turn and cross over the median curb
hit the 'burbs and all you see is a blur from 8 mile road


i'm a man, gotta make a new plan
(it's alright, it's okay)
time for me to just stand up and travel new land
(i'm gonna make it anyway)
time for me to just take matters into my own hands
(gonna make it, can't give up now)
once i'm over these tracks, man, i'ma never look back
(i'ma make it somehow)
(8 mile road) and i'm gone, i know right where i'm goin'
(it's alright, it's okay)
sorry, momma, i'm grown, i must travel alone
(i'm gonna make it anyway)
ain't gon' follow no footsteps, i'm makin' my own
(gonna make it, can't give up now)
only way that i know how to escape from this 8 mile road
(i'ma make it somehow)

you wouldn't wanna be anywhere else in the world right now
so without further ado, i bring to you (marshall!)


you 'bout to witness hip-hop in its most purest
most rawest form, flow almost flawless
most hardest, most honest known artist
chip off the old block, but old doc is (back)
looks like batman brought his own robin
oh god, saddam's got his own laden
with his own private plane, his own pilot
set to blow college dorm room doors off the hinges
oranges, peach, pears, plums, syringes
vrinn, vrinn! yeah, here i come, i'm inches
away from you, dear, fear none
hip-hop is in a state of 9-1-1, so


let's get down to business
i don't got no time to play around, what is this?
must be a circus in town, let's shut the shit down
on these clowns; can i get a witness? (hell yeah!)

quick, gotta move fast, gotta perform miracles
gee willikers, dre, holy bat syllables!
look at all the bullshit that goes on in gotham
when i'm gone, time to get rid of these rap criminals
so skip to your lou while i do what i do best
you ain't even impressed no more, you're used to it
flow's too wet, nobody close to it
nobody says it but still everybody knows the shit
the most hated on out of all those who say they get hated on
in eighty songs and exaggerate it all so much
they make it all up, there's no such thing
like a female with good looks who cooks and cleans
it just means so much more to so much more
people, when you're rappin' and you know what for
the show must go on; so i'd like to welcome y'all
to marshall and andre's carnival, c'mon!


now let's get down to business
i don't got no time to play around, what is this?
must be a circus in town, let's shut the shit down

let's get down to business
i don't got no time to play around, what is this?
must be a circus in town, let's shut the shit down
on these clowns; can i get a witness? (hell yeah!)


it's just like old times, the dynamic duo
two old friends, why panic? you already know
who's fully capable, the two caped heroes
dial straight down the center, eight-zero-zero
you can even call collect, the most feared duet
since me and elton played career russian roulette
and never even see me blink or get to bustin' a sweat
people steppin' over people just to rush to the set
just to get to see an mc who breathes so freely
ease over these beats and be so breezy
jesus, how can shit be so easy?
how can one chandra be so levy?
turn on these beats, mcs don't see me
believe me, bet and mtv
are gonna grieve when we leave, dog, fo' sheezy
can't leave rap alone, the game needs me
'til we grow beards, get weird and disappear
into the mountains, nothin' but clowns down here
but we ain't fuckin' around 'round here
yo, dre (what up?) can i get a "hell..."? (hell yeah!)


now let's get down to business
i don't got no time to play around, what is this?
must be a circus in town, let's shut the shit down
on these clowns; can i get a witness? (hell yeah!)

so there you have it, folks
(marshall!) has come to save the day
back with his friend andre
and to remind you that bullshit does not pay
because (marshall!) and andre are here to stay
and never go away
until our dying day
until we're old and grey (marshall!)
so until next time, friends
same blonde hair, same rap channel
good night, everyone!
thank you for coming! your host for the evening (marshall!)
oh! heh

obie, yo
i'm sick
damn, you straight, dog?


that's why i ain't got no time (i think i got chlamydia)
for these games and stupid tricks
or these bitches (bitch!) on my dick
that's how dudes be gettin' sick (that bitch!)
that's how dicks be gettin' drips
fallin' victims to this shit
from these bitches on our dicks
fuckin' chickens with no ribs
that's why i ain't got no time


that's why i ain't got no time
for these games and stupid tricks
or these bitches on my dick
that's how dudes be gettin' sick
that's how dicks be gettin' drips
fallin' victims to this shit
from these bitches on our dicks
fuckin' chickens with no ribs
that's why i ain't got no time


now i don't wanna hit no woman, but this chick's got it comin'
someone better get this bitch 'fore she gets kicked in the stomach
and she's pregnant, but she's eggin' me on, beggin' me to throw her
off the steps of this porch, my only weapon is force
and i don't wanna resort to violence of any sort
though what's she shovin' me for? (bitch!) doesn't she love me no more?
wasn't she huggin' me four minutes ago at the door?
man, i'm this close to goin' toe-to-toe with this whore
what would you do if she was tellin' you she wants a divorce?
she's havin' another baby in a month, and it's yours
and you found out it isn't, 'cause this bitch has been visitin' someone else
and suckin' his dick and kissin' you on the lips when you get back to michigan
now the plot is thickenin' worse
‘cause you feel like you've been stickin' your fuckin' dick in a hearse
so you're paranoid at every little cold that you get
ever since they sold you this shit, you've been holdin' your dick
so you go to the clinic, sweatin' every minute you in it
then the doctor comes out, lookin' like dennis the menace (ha-ha-ha-ha-ha)
and it's obvious to everyone in the lobby it's aids (sorry)
he ain't even gotta call you in his office to say it (sorry)
so you jet back home, 'cause you gon' get that ho
when you see her, you gon' bend her fuckin' neck back, yo
'cause you love her, you never would expect that blow
obie told you the scoop, how could she stoop that low?
jesus, i don't believe this bitch works at the cleaner's
bringin' me home diseases, swingin' from obie's penis
she's so deceivin', shit, this ho's a genius, she g'd us


that's why i ain't got no time
for these games and stupid tricks
or these bitches on my dick
that's how dudes be gettin' sick
that's how dicks be gettin' drips
fallin' victims to this shit
from these bitches on our dicks
fuckin' chickens with no ribs
that's why i ain't got no time


i'm busy, yeah, fuck these bitches!
fuck 'em all!
get money, shady records
ha, whoa!
obie trice! eminem, motherfucker!
new millennium shit, yeah
turn this shit off, man
turn this shit the fuck—

da-da, da-da
yo, i can't sing, but
i feel like singing
i wanna fuckin' sing
'cause i'm happy
yeah, i'm happy
i got my baby back
yo, check it out


some days i sit starin' out the window
watchin' this world pass me by
sometimes i think there's nothin' to live for
i almost break down and cry
sometimes i think i'm crazy
i'm crazy, oh, so crazy
why am i here? am i just wastin' my time?
but then i see my baby
suddenly i'm not crazy
it all makes sense when i look into her eyes, oh, no


'cause sometimes it feels like the world's on my shoulders
(fuck, i was scared)
everyone's leanin' on me
‘cause sometimes it feels like the world's almost over
but then she comes back to me


my baby girl keeps gettin' older
i watch her grow up with pride
people make jokes ‘cause they don't understand me
they just don't see my real side
i act like shit don't faze me
inside it drives me crazy
my insecurities could eat me alive
but then i see my baby
suddenly i'm not crazy
it all makes sense when i look into her eyes, oh, no


‘cause sometimes it feels like the world's on my shoulders
everyone's leanin' on me
‘cause sometimes it feels like the world's almost over
but then she comes back to me


man, if i could sing, i'd keep singin' this song to my daughter
if i could hit the notes, i'd blow somethin' as long as my father
to show her how i feel about her, how proud i am that i got her
god, i'm a daddy, i'm so glad that her mom didn't *reh tnaw*
now, you probably get this picture from my public persona
that i'm a pistol-packin' drug addict who bags on his momma
but i wanna just take this time out to be perfectly honest
‘cause there's a lot of shit i keep bottled that hurts deep inside of
my soul and just know that i grow colder the older i grow
this boulder on my shoulder gets heavy and harder to hold
and this load is like the weight of the world
and i think my neck is breakin'
should i just give up or try to live up to these expectations?
now look, i love my daughter more than life in itself
but i got a wife that's determined to make my life livin' hell
but i handle it well, given the circumstances i'm dealt
so many chances, man, it's too bad, coulda had someone else
but the years that i've wasted is nothin' to the tears that i've tasted
so here's what i'm facin': three felonies, six years of probation
i've went to jail for this woman
i've been to bat for this woman
i've taken bats to people's backs
bent over backwards for this woman
man, i shoulda seen it comin', what'd i stick my penis up in?
wouldn't have ripped the prenup up if i'da seen what she was fuckin'
but fuck it, it's over, there's no more reason to cry no more
i got my baby, maybe, the only lady that i adore
hailie! so sayonara, try tomorrow, nice to know ya
our baby's traveled back to the arms of her rightful owner
and suddenly it seems like my shoulder blades have just shifted
it's like the greatest gift you can get, the weight has been lifted
and—


now it don't feel like the world's on my shoulders
everyone's leanin' on me
'cause my baby knows that her daddy's a soldier
nothin' can take her from me


wooo! told you i can't sing
oh, well—i tried
hailie, 'member when i said
if you ever need anything, daddy would be right there?
guess what—daddy's here
and i ain't goin' nowhere, baby
i love you (​​*smooch*)​​

the invasion! (invasion!)
yeah! yeah!
green lantern! (green lantern!)
the infiltration
we coming! yeah!


i got 50 cent, i got g-unit (uh-huh)
d-twizzy in this bitch (haha), with obie trice (woo!)
so watch what you say (uh-huh), 'fore you call our name (yep)
'cause you say one more thing and it won't be nice!


whoa, here we go, i should've known
i was bound to get pulled into some bullshit
sooner or later, you little haters
are too jealous of us, still love us, you hate it, g-unit made it
and obie's coming, d-twizzy's coming
you're sick to your stomach ("ugh!")
fifty percent of it's 50 cent
the other 50 percent of it's whose color of skin it is
but if you even considering taking our label down
you better find our building and fly a fucking plane into it,
but i ain't trying to get too intricate into it
i'm just tryna give you a little hint for your own benefit
'cause then it's gonna get to the point where it escalates
into some other shit, then i'ma flip
then i'ma get to "stomping in my air force ones"
but you won't be able to tell if it's two pairs or it's one
it's just gonna feel like so many feet kicking you
you'll think nike just made these into cleats in the shoe
i don't know what it is or what it could be
but i get a woody when these pussies try to push me
thinking they gonna put me in a position to pickle me (woo!)
y'all tickle me pink, i think i'd just rather have p!nk tickle me (hehe)
hickory-dickory-dock, tickety-tock-tickety
a little bit of the diggedy-doc-diggedy
mixed with a little bit of the jigga-j-jigga
with a small pinch of biggie
look at me, i'm just the bomb-diggedy


we the realest label
don't try to act like you don't feel our label
'cause we gon' fuck around and kill your label
obie, d-twizzy, g-unit, 50, shady records, we the label fa' sho!
we the realest label
don’t try to act like you don’t feel our label
'cause we gon' fuck around and steal your paper
obie, d-twizzy, g-unit, 50, we gon' kill your fucking label fa' sho!
yeah!

shady in the place to be see
and i got what it takes to rock the mic right!
still watch what you say to me, punk
'cause i'm off probation in less than six months! {*gun cocks*}


haha! (woo!)
shady records
still aftermath
and don't think we don't hear you motherfuckers talking!
'cause we do
we see y'all
but we just gon' sit back for a minute and watch what the fuck y'all do!

look, if you had one shot or one opportunity
to seize everything you ever wanted in one moment
would you capture it or just let it slip?
yo


his palms are sweaty, knees weak, arms are heavy
there's vomit on his sweater already, mom's spaghetti
he's nervous, but on the surface, he looks calm and ready
to drop bombs, but he keeps on forgetting
what he wrote down, the whole crowd goes so loud
he opens his mouth, but the words won't come out
he's chokin', how? everybody's jokin' now
the clock's run out, time's up, over, blaow
snap back to reality, ope, there goes gravity
ope, there goes rabbit, he choked, he's so mad
but he won't give up that easy, no, he won't have it
he knows his whole back's to these ropes, it don't matter
he's dope, he knows that, but he's broke, he's so stagnant
he knows when he goes back to this mobile home, that's when it's
back to the lab again, yo, this old rhapsody
better go capture this moment and hope it don't pass him


you better lose yourself in the music
the moment, you own it, you better never let it go (go)
you only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
this opportunity comes once in a lifetime, yo
you better lose yourself in the music
the moment, you own it, you better never let it go (go)
you only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
this opportunity comes once in a lifetime, yo
you better


his soul's escaping through this hole that is gaping
this world is mine for the taking, make me king
as we move toward a new world order
a normal life is boring, but superstardom's
close to post-mortem, it only grows harder
homie grows hotter, he blows, it's all over
these hoes is all on him, coast-to-coast shows
he's known as the globetrotter, lonely roads
god only knows he's grown farther from home, he's no father
he goes home and barely knows his own daughter
but hold your nose 'cause here goes the cold water
these hoes don't want him no mo', he's cold product
they moved on to the next schmoe who flows
he nose-dove and sold nada, and so the soap opera
is told, it unfolds, i suppose it's old, partner
but the beat goes on, da-da-dom, da-dom, dah-dah-dah-dah


you better lose yourself in the music
the moment, you own it, you better never let it go (go)
you only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
this opportunity comes once in a lifetime, yo
you better lose yourself in the music
the moment, you own it, you better never let it go (go)
you only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
this opportunity comes once in a lifetime, yo
you better


no more games, i'ma change what you call rage
tear this motherfuckin' roof off like two dogs caged
i was playin' in the beginning, the mood all changed
i've been chewed up and spit out and booed off stage
but i kept rhymin' and stepped right in the next cypher
best believe somebody's payin' the pied piper
all the pain inside amplified by the
fact that i can't get by with my nine-to-
five and i can't provide the right type of life for my family
'cause, man, these goddamn food stamps don't buy diapers
and there's no movie, there's no mekhi phifer, this is my life
and these times are so hard, and it's gettin' even harder
tryna feed and water my seed, plus teeter-totter
caught up between bein' a father and a prima donna
baby-mama drama, screamin' on her, too much for me to wanna
stay in one spot, another day of monotony's gotten me
to the point i'm like a snail, i've got
to formulate a plot or end up in jail or shot
success is my only motherfuckin' option, failure's not
mom, i love you, but this trailer's got
to go, i cannot grow old in salem's lot
so here i go, it's my shot; feet, fail me not
this may be the only opportunity that i got


you better lose yourself in the music
the moment, you own it, you better never let it go (go)
you only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
this opportunity comes once in a lifetime, yo
you better lose yourself in the music
the moment, you own it, you better never let it go (go)
you only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
this opportunity comes once in a lifetime, yo
you better


you can do anything you set your mind to, man

ha-ha!
okay then! everybody, listen up!
i'm goin' to hell! who's comin' with me?
somebody, please help him!
i think my dad's gone crazy!


there's no mountain i can't climb
there's no tower too high, no plane that i can't learn how to fly
what do i gotta do to get through to you
to show you there ain't nothin' i can't take this chainsaw to?
(rahhnnn!) fuckin' brains, brawn and brass balls
i cut 'em off and got 'em pickled and bronzed in a glass jar
inside of a hall, with my framed autographed sunglasses
with elton john's name on my drag wall
i'm out the closet, i've been lyin' my ass off
all this time, me and dre been fuckin' with hats off
(suck it, marshall!) so tell laura and her husband to back off
'fore i push this motherfuckin' button and blast off
and launch one of these russians, and that's all
blow every fuckin' thing except afghanistan on the map off
when will it stop? when will i knock the crap off?
(*knocking*) hailie, tell 'em, baby! (my dad's lost it!)


there's really nothin' else to say, i, i can't explain it
i think my dad's gone crazy!
a little help from hailie jade, won't you tell 'em, maybe?
i think my dad's gone crazy!
there's nothin' you could do or say that could ever change me
i think my dad's gone crazy!
there's no one on earth that can save me, not even hailie
i think my dad's gone crazy! (crazy)


it's like my mother always told me:
"rana rana rana rana rana rana rana rana rana and codeine and
goddamn it, you little motherfucker
if you ain't got nothin' nice to say, then don't say nothin'!"
uh… fuck that shit, bitch!
eat a motherfuckin' dick, chew on a prick
and lick a million motherfuckin' cocks per second
i'd rather put out a motherfuckin' gospel record
i'd rather be a pussy-whipped bitch
eat pussy and have pussy lips glued to my face
with a clit ring in my nose, than quit bringin' my flows
quit givin' me my ammo; can't you see why i'm so mean?
if y'all leave me alone this wouldn't be my m.o.
i wouldn't have to go eenee-meenee-meini-mo
catch a homo by his toe, man, i don't know no more
am i the only fuckin' one who's normal anymore? (dad!)


there's really nothin' else to say, i, i can't explain it
i think my dad's gone crazy!
a little help from hailie jade, won't you tell 'em, maybe?
i think my dad's gone crazy!
there's nothin' you could do or say that could ever change me
i think my dad's gone crazy!
there's no one on earth that can save me, not even hailie
i think my dad's gone crazy! (crazy)


my songs can make you cry, take you by surprise
at the same time, can make you dry your eyes
with the same rhyme, see, what you're seein'
is a genius at work, which to me isn't work
so it's easy to misinterpret it at first, ‘cause when i speak
it's tongue-in-cheek, i'd yank my fuckin' teeth
before i'd ever bite my tongue, i'd slice my gums
get struck by fuckin' lightning twice at once
and die and come back as vanilla ice's son
and walk around the rest of my life spit on
and kicked and hit with shit every time i sung
like r. kelly as soon as "bump and grind" comes on
more pain inside of my brain, than the eyes of a little girl
inside of a plane aimed at the world trade
standin' on ronnie's grave, screamin' at the sky
'til clouds gather; it's clyde mathers and bonnie jade
and that's pretty much the gist of it
parents are pissed, but the kids love it
9 millimeter heaters stashed in two-seaters with meat cleavers
i don't blame you, i wouldn't let hailie listen to me neither


there's really nothin' else to say, i, i can't explain it
i think my dad's gone crazy!
a little help from hailie jade, won't you tell 'em, maybe?
i think my dad's gone crazy!
there's nothin' you could do or say that could ever change me
i think my dad's gone crazy!
there's no one on earth that can save me, not even hailie
i think my dad's gone crazy! (crazy)


crazy
ha-ha-ha-ha ha-ha-ha-ha
you're funny, daddy!

this motherfucker, man!
just won't shut up, will you?
talkin' 'bout i owe him
bitch, you owe me!
i'm promotin' you right now
yo, let's put the nail in this coffin!


i don't wanna be like this
i don't really wanna hurt no feelings
but i'm only being real when i say
nobody wants to hear their grandfather rap (nope)
and old men have heart attacks
and i don't wanna be responsible for that
so, put the mic down and walk away
you can still have a little bit of dignity


i would never claim to be no
ray benzino
an eighty-three-year-old fake pacino
so how can he hold me over some balcony without throwin' his lower back out as soon as he goes to lift me? (ugh!)
please don't, you'll probably fall with me and our asses'll both be history (aah!)
but then again, you'd finally get your wish
‘cause you'd be all over the street like 50 cent (hahahaha)
you fuckin' punk, pussy, fuck you, chump
give me a one-on-one, see if i don't fuck you up,
tryna jump the ruff ryders and they cut you up
and you put jada on a track, that's how much you suck
dick in the industry, swear that you in the streets hustlin'
you sit behind a fuckin' desk at the source butt-kissin'
and beggin' motherfuckers for guest appearances
and you can't even get the clearances
'cause real lyricists don't even respect you or take you serious
it's not that we don't like you—we hate you, period
talk about a mid-life crisis, damn
last week you was shakin' obie trice's hand
now he's a buster? what the fuck's with that?
get on a track dissin' us, kissin' 50's ass
and askin' me what i know about indictments, bite me
bitch, i got two cases and probation—fight me
what do i know about standin' in front of a judge like a man
ready to take whatever sentence he hands?
what you know about your wife slicin' her wrists, right in
front of the only thing that you have in this world, a little girl?
and i put that on her, when this is all over
i would never try to make her a star and eat off her
i don't know shit about no choppin' rocks
but what you know about hip hop shops rockin' spots
where you're the only white boy up in that bitch, just rippin'?
pressin' up your own fliers and your stickers, stickin'
them bitches up after spendin' six hours at kinko's
makin' copies of your covers of cassette singles
to sell them out of the trunk of your tracer
spendin' your whole paychecks at disc makers
what you know about bein' bullied over half your life?
oh, that's right, you should know what that's like, you're half white (haha)
vanilla ice, spill the beans and rice
i'm eatin' you alive inside, jesus christ!
if you're that much of a gangsta, put the mic down
you should be out killin' motherfuckers right now
kill a motherfucker dead, kill him dead, bitch!
shoot 'em in the fuckin' head—go ahead, bitch!
slap my mom! slap the fuck out of her!
she can't sue you, she wouldn't get a buck out of ya
‘cause you're broke as fuck, you suck, you're a fuckin' joke!
if you was really sellin' coke, well, then what the fuck
you stop for, dummy? if you slew some crack
you'd make a lot more money than you do from rap (haha)
you'll never have no security, you'll never be famous
you'll never know what it's like to be rich, life's a bitch, ain't it?
raymond? here, let me break this shit down in layman's terms for you
just to make sure that you can understand us
and canibus ain't usin' too many complicated fuckin' words for you
here, and let me slow it down for you
so that you can understand if i say it slower
let it go, dog, it's over


i don't wanna be like this
i don't really wanna hurt no feelings
but i'm only being real when i say
nobody wants to hear they grandfather rap (uh-uh)
and old men have heart attacks
and i don't wanna be responsible for that
so, put the mic down and walk away
you can still have a little bit of dignity


haha… talkin' 'bout... i have motherfuckers... callin' your crib
bitch, you ain't even got a fuckin' crib!
you ain't even got a fuckin' phone… fuckin' bum
threatenin' to... shut me down at your lil' fuckin' source magazine if i come back on you and attack you
bitch, you attacked me first, take it like a man, and shut the fuck up
and fuck your little magazine too
i don't need your little fuckin' magazine
i got xxl's number anyways
and y'all can't stand it ‘cause they gettin' bigger than y'all
oh... and by the way... how'd i look on the vma's?
when you was watchin' me from...
whatever fuckin' tv he was watchin' me from
in boston… the mean streets of boston
fuckin' sissy... and you got us scared up in here, motherfucker
suck our motherfuckin' dicks
oh... and for those that don't know
don't get it twisted, y'all... the source has a white owner!

look, if you had one shot or one opportunity
to seize everything you ever wanted in one moment
would you capture it, or just let it slip? yo


his palms are sweaty, knees weak, arms are heavy
there's vomit on his sweater already, mom's spaghetti
he's nervous, but on the surface he looks calm and ready
to drop bombs, but he keeps on forgetting
what he wrote down, the whole crowd goes so loud
he opens his mouth, but the words won't come out
he's choking, how? evеrybody's joking now
the clock's run out, time's up, over—blaow!
snap back to rеality, ope there goes gravity, ope
there goes rabbit, he choked, he's so mad but he won't
give up that easy, no, he won't have it, he knows
his whole back's to these ropes, it don't matter, he's dope
he knows that but he's broke, he's so stagnant, he knows
when he goes back to this mobile home, that's when it's
back to the lab again yo, this old rap shit, he
better go capture this moment and hope it don't pass him, and


you better lose yourself in the music
the moment, you own it, you better never let it go (go!)
you only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
this opportunity comes once in a lifetime, yo
you better lose yourself in the music
the moment, you own it, you better never let it go (go!)
you only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
this opportunity comes once in a lifetime, yo
you better…


his soul's escaping through this hole that is gaping
this world is mine for the taking, make me king
as we move toward a new world order
a normal life is boring; but superstardom's
close to post-mortem, it only grows harder
homie grows hotter, he blows, it's all over
these hoes is all on him, coast-to-coast shows
he's known as the globetrotter, lonely roads
god only knows, he's grown farther from home, he's no father
he goes home and barely knows his own daughter
but hold your nose, 'cause here goes the cold water
these hoes don't want him no mo', he's cold product
they moved on to the next schmoe who flows
he nose-dove and sold nada, and so the soap opera
is told, it unfolds, i suppose it's old, partner
but the beat goes on: da-da-dom, da-dom, dah-dah, dah-dah


you better lose yourself in the music
the moment, you own it, you better never let it go (go!)
you only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
this opportunity comes once in a lifetime, yo
you better lose yourself in the music
the moment, you own it, you better never let it go (go!)

you better…


no more games, i'ma change what you call rage
tear this motherfuckin' roof off like two dogs caged
i was playin' in the beginning, the mood all changed
i've been chewed up and spit out and booed off stage
but i kept rhymin' and stepped right in the next cypher
best believe somebody's payin' the pied piper
all the pain inside amplified by the
fact that i can't get by with my nine-to-
five and i can't provide the right type of life for my family
'cause man, these goddamn food stamps don't buy diapers
and there's no movie, there's no mekhi phifer, this is my life
and these times are so hard, and it's gettin' even harder
tryna feed and water my seed, plus teeter-totter
caught up between bein' a father and a prima donna
baby mama drama, screamin' on her, too much for me to wanna
stay in one spot, another day of monotony's
gotten me to the point i'm like a snail, i've got
to formulate a plot or end up in jail or shot
success is my only motherfuckin' option—failure's not
mom, i love you, but this trailer's got
to go; i cannot grow old in salem's lot
so here i go, it's my shot: feet, fail me not
this may be the only opportunity that i got


you better lose yourself in the music
the moment, you own it, you better never let it go (go!)
you only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow

you can do anything you set your mind to, man

some days i just wanna up and call it quits
i feel, like i'm surrounded by a wall of bricks
every time i go to get up, i just fall in pits
my life's like one great big ball of shit
if i could just put it all into all, i spit
'stead of always tryna swallow it, instead of starin'
at this wall and shit while i sit, writer's block
sick of all this shit, can't call it, shit
all i know is i'm about to hit the wall
if i have to see another one of mom's alcoholic fits
this is it, last straw, that's all, that's it
i ain't dealin' with another fuckin' politic
i'm like a skillet bubblin' until it filters up
i'm about to kill it, i can feel it buildin' up
blow this buildin' up, i've concealed enough
my cup runneth over, i done filled it up
the pen explodes and busts, ink spills my guts
you think, all i do is stand here and feel my nuts
well, i'ma show you what, you gon' feel my rush
you don't feel it, then it must be too real to touch
peel the dutch, i'm about to tear shit up
goosebumps, yeah, i'ma make your hair sit up
yeah, sit up, i'ma tell you, who i be
i'ma make you hate me 'cause you ain't me
you wait, it ain't too late to finally see
what you, closed-minded fucks, were too blind to see
whoever finds me's gonna get a finder's fee
out this world, ain't no one out their mind as me
you need peace of mind? here's a piece of mine
all i need's a line
but sometimes i don't always find the words to rhyme
to express, how i'm really feelin' at that time
yeah, sometimes, sometimes, sometimes
it's just  “sometimes”, it's always me
how dark can these hallways be?
the clock strikes midnight, one, two, then half-past three
this half-assed rhyme with this half-assed piece of paper
i'm desperate at my desk
if i could just get the rest of the shit off my chest again
stuck in a slump, can't think of nothin'
fuck, i'm stumped, but wait, here comes somethin', nope
it's not good enough, scribble it out
new pad, crinkle it up, and throw the shit out
i'm fizzlin' now, thought i figured it out
ball's in my court, but i'm scared to dribble it out
i'm afraid, but why am i afraid?
why am i a slave to this trade?
cyanide i spit to the grave
real enough to rile you up
want me to flip it? i can rip it any style you want
i'm a switch hitter, bitch, jimmy smith ain't a quitter
i'ma sit, until i get enough in me to finally hit a
fuckin' boilin' point, put some oil in your joints
flip the coin, bitch, come get destroyed
an mcs worst dream, i make 'em tense
they hate me, see me, and shake like a chain-link fence
by the looks of 'em, you would swear that jaws was comin'
by the screams of 'em, you would swear, i'm sawin' someone
by the way, they're runnin', you would swear, the law was comin'
it's now or never, and tonight is all or nothin'
“momma, jimmy keeps leavin' on us
he said, he'd be back, he pinky promised, i don't think he's honest”
i'll be back, baby, i just gotta beat this clock
fuck this clock! i'ma make 'em eat this watch
don't believe me? watch, i'ma win this race
and i'ma come back, and rub my shit in your face, bitch!
i found my niche, you gon' hear my voice
'til you're sick of it, you ain't gonna have a choice
if i gotta scream, 'til i have half a lung
if i have half a chance, i'll grab it—rabbit, run!

i thought i had it all figured out, i did
i thought i was tough enough to stick it out with kim
but i wasn't tough enough to juggle two things at once
i found myself layin' on my knees in cuffs
which should've been a reason enough for me to get my stuff
and just leave, how come i couldn't see this shit myself?
it's just me, nobody couldn't see the shit i felt
knowin' damn well she wasn't gonna be there when i fell
to catch me; the minute shit was heated, she just bailed
i'm standin' here swingin' on like thirty people by myself
i couldn't even see the millimeter when it fell
turned around, saw gary stashin' the heater in his belt
saw the bouncers rush him and beat him to the ground
i just sold two million records, i don't need to go to jail
i'm not about to lose my freedom over no female
i need to slow down, try to get my feet on solid ground
so for now—


sayin', "goodbye", sayin', "goodbye" to hollywood
(so, how do you like my life now?)
sayin', "goodbye", sayin', "goodbye" to hollywood
sayin', "goodbye", sayin', "goodbye" to hollywood
sayin', "goodbye", sayin', "goodbye" to hollywood

bury my face in comic books 'cause i don't wanna look
at nothing, this world's too much, i've swallowed all i could
if i could swallow a bottle of tylenol, i would
and end it for good, just say, “goodbye” to hollywood
i probably should, these problems are pilin' all at once
‘cause everything that bothers me, i got it bottled up
i think i'm bottomin' out, but i'm not about to give up
i gotta get up, thank god, i got a little girl
and i'm a responsible father, so not a lot of good
i'd be to my daughter layin' in the bottom of the mud
must be in my blood ‘cause i don't know how i do it
all i know is i don't wanna follow in the footsteps
of my dad, ‘cause i hate him so bad
the worst fear that i had
was growin' up to be like his fuckin' ass
man, if you could understand why i am the way that i am
what do i say to my fans when i tell 'em i'm


sayin', "goodbye", sayin', "goodbye" to hollywood
sayin', "goodbye", sayin', "goodbye" to hollywood
sayin', "goodbye", sayin', "goodbye" to hollywood
sayin', "goodbye", sayin', "goodbye" to hollywood

sayin', "goodbye", sayin', "goodbye" to hollywood
sayin', "goodbye", sayin', "goodbye" to hollywood
sayin', "goodbye", sayin', "goodbye" to hollywood
sayin', "goodbye", sayin', "goodbye" to hollywood


i don't wanna quit, but shit, i feel like this is it
for me to have this much appeal like this is sick
this is not a game, this fame in real life, this is sick
"publicity stunt" my ass, "conceal" my fuckin' dick
fuck the guns, i'm done, i'll never look at gats
if i scrap, i'll scrap like i ain't never whipped some ass
i love my fans, but no one ever puts a grasp
on the fact, i've sacrificed everything i have
i never dreamt, i'd get to the level that i'm at
this is wack, this is more than i ever coulda asked
everywhere i go, a hat, a sweater hood or mask
what about math, how come i wasn't ever good at that?
it's like the boy in the bubble who never could adapt
i'm trapped, if i could go back, i never would've rapped
i sold my soul to the devil, i'll never get it back
i just wanna leave this game with level head intact
imagine goin' from bein' a no-one to seein'
everything blow up, and all you did was just grow up emceein'
it's fuckin' crazy, ‘cause all i wanted was to give hailie
the life i never had, instead i forced us to live alienated, so i'm sayin'


sayin', "goodbye", sayin', "goodbye" to hollywood
sayin', "goodbye", sayin', "goodbye" to hollywood
sayin', "goodbye", sayin', "goodbye" to hollywood

sayin', "goodbye", sayin', "goodbye" to hollywood


goodbye, goodbye, hollywood (goodbye)
please don't cry for me (it's been real)
when i'm gone for good (this shit is not for me)
so goodbye, goodbye, hollywood (i'm not a fuckin' star)
please don't cry for me (no way)
when i'm gone for good (i'm goin' back home)

heh, so i'm out the game, huh? (huh, huh)
yo, dre, we ridin'?
whatever (ha-ha)
well, i'm wit' ya, homie
okay, let's handle the small shit


i was born to brew up storms, stir up shit
kick up dust, cuss 'til i slur up spit
grew up too quick, went through too much, knew too much shit
corrupt, and i'ma pour it on like syrup, bitch
thick and rich, sick and twisted, mr. buttersworth
dre told me to milk this shit for what it's worth
'til the cow just tilts and tips and stumbles to earth
and if i fumble a verse, keep goin'
first take i make mistakes, just keep it
no punches pull, no punches, that's weak shit
fake shit, if i ever take shit, i'll eat shit
wasn't for him, wouldn't be shit
creep with me as we take a little trip down memory lane
been here longer than anyone in the game
and i ain't got to lie about my age
but what about jermaine? fuck jermaine!
he don't belong speakin' mine or timbaland's name
and don't think i don't read your little interviews and see what you're sayin'
i'm a giant, and i ain't gotta move 'til i'm provoked
when i see you, i'ma step on you and not even know it
you midget, mini-me with a bunch of little mini-yous
runnin' around your backyard swimming pools
over eighty million records sold
and i ain't have to do it with ten- or eleven-year-olds


‘cause what you say is what you say
say what you say how you say it whenever you sayin' it
just remember how you said it when you was sprayin' it
so who you playin' with, huh? (huh, huh, huh)
‘cause what you say is what you say
say what you say how you say it whenever you sayin' it
just remember how you said it when you was sprayin' it
so who you playin' with, huh? (huh, huh, huh)


second verse, it gets worse, it gets no better than this
amateurs drink veteran piss
from a dixie cup, if you ever mix me up
or confuse me with a canibus or dre with a dupri
we'll rub it in, every club you're in, we'll have you blackballed
and make sure you never rap a-fuckin'-gain
dre ain't havin' it, long as i'm here to play devil's advocate
if there was some magic shit i could wave
over the industry that could save it when i'm gone
and buried to make sure the tradition carries on, i would
if i could only use this power for good, i wouldn't, not even if i could
from the hood, and i'm a hornet
and i'ma only sting when i'm cornered
and i'ma only sucker punch and swing without warning
and swing to knock somebody's fuckin' head off
‘cause i know if they get up, i won't get a chance to let off
another punch, i'm punk rock, no one's punk
don't give a fuck, white pac, so much spunk
when i was little i knew i would blow up and sell a mil'
or grow up to be attila, go nuts and be a killer
and i'm something of a phenom, one puff of the chron'
i'm unstoppable, i'm alive and on top again
there's no obstacle that i can't conquer
so come along with us (come on)


‘cause what you say is what you say
say what you say how you say it whenever you sayin' it
just remember how you said it when you was sprayin' it
so who you playin' with, huh? (huh, huh, huh)
‘cause what you say is what you say
say what you say how you say it whenever you sayin' it
just remember how you said it when you was sprayin' it
so who you playin' with, huh? (huh, huh, huh)


now anybody who knows dre knows i'm about
fast cars and alizé, partyin' all day
but i handled my business, ‘cause it's work before play
don't look for trouble, but i'll serve you gourmet
however you want it, you can have it your way
you fuck my night up, i'ma fuck up your day
bullet with your name, sendin' it your way
that goes for anyone who walks through that doorway
‘cause this is my space, you invade it
live to regret it, and you'll die tryna violate it
fuck around, get annihilated
eyes dilated, huh, like my old lady?
‘cause what you say is what you say, sometimes what you mean
is two different things, depending on your mood if it swings
think too many things, little hit of dre's weed, i can do anything
catch a contact and i'm gone, and i'm back
i speed write and my loose leaf's my launchpad
and i can pull any string, don't have to prove anything
catch a contract on your head, you headed west?
talk shit about dre, you better get a vest and invest in something to protect your head and neck
and it's back and forth all day, like red and meth
i joke when i say i'm the best in the booth, but a lot of truth is said in jest
and if i ever do live to be a legend, i'ma die a sudden death
five mics in the source? ain't holdin' my fuckin' breath
but i'll suffocate for the respect 'fore i breathe to collect a fuckin' check


‘cause what you say is what you say
say what you say how you say it whenever you sayin' it
just remember how you said it when you was sprayin' it
so who you playin' with, huh? (huh, huh, huh)
‘cause what you say is what you say
say what you say how you say it whenever you sayin' it
just remember how you said it when you was sprayin' it
so who you playin' with, huh? (huh, huh, huh)



these ideas are nightmares to white parents
whose worst fear is a child with dyed hair and who likes earrings
like whatever they say has no bearing
it's so scary in a house that allows no swearing
to see him walkin' around with his headphones blarin'
alone in his own zone, cold and he don't care, he's
a problem child, and what bothers him all comes out
when he talks about his fuckin' dad walkin' out (bitch!)
'cause he hates him so bad that he blocks him out
if he ever saw him again he'd probably knock him out
his thoughts are wacked, he's mad so he's talkin' back
talkin' black, brainwashed from rock and rap
he sags his pants, do-rags and a stockin' cap
his stepfather hit him so he socked him back
and broke his nose, his house is a broken home
there's no control, he just lets his emotions go

(come on!) sing with me (sing!), sing for the year (sing it!)
sing for the laughter and sing for the tear (come on!)
sing it with me, it's just for today
maybe tomorrow the good lord will take you away


entertainment is changin', intertwinin' with gangsters
in the land of the killers, a sinner's mind is a sanctum
holy or unholy, only have one homie
only this gun, lonely ‘cause don't anyone know me
yet everybody just feels like they can relate (huh-uh)
i guess words are a motherfucker, they can be great
or they can degrade, or even worse, they can teach hate
it's like these kids hang on every single statement we make
like they worship us, plus all the stores ship us platinum
now how the fuck did this metamorphosis happen?
from standin' on corners and porches just rappin'
to havin' a fortune, no more kissin' ass
but then these critics crucify you (yep), journalists try to burn you
fans turn on you, attorneys all want a turn at you
to get they hands on every dime you have
they want you to lose your mind every time you mad
so they can try to make you out to look like a loose cannon
any dispute won't hesitate to produce handguns
that's why these prosecutors wanna convict me
strictly just to get me off of these streets quickly
but all they kids be listenin' to me religiously
so i'm signin' cds while police fingerprint me
they're for the judge's daughter, but his grudge is against me
if i'm such a fuckin' menace, this shit doesn't make sense, b
it's all political, if my music is literal
and i'm a criminal, how the fuck can i raise a little girl?
i couldn't, i wouldn't be fit to
you're full of shit too, guerrera, that was a fist that hit you! (bitch!)


(come on!) sing with me (sing!), sing for the year (sing it!)
sing for the laughter and sing for the tear (sing that shit!)
sing it with me, it's just for today
maybe tomorrow the good lord will take you away


they say music can alter moods and talk to you
well, can it load a gun up for you and cock it too?
well, if it can, then the next time you assault a dude
just tell the judge it was my fault and i'll get sued
see, what these kids do is hear about us totin' pistols
and they wanna get one ‘cause they think the shit's cool
not knowin' we really just protectin' ourselves
we entertainers, of course the shit's affectin' our sales
you ignoramus, but music is reflection of self
we just explain it, and then we get our checks in the mail
it's fucked up, ain't it? how we can come from practically nothin'
to bein' able to have any fuckin' thing that we wanted
that's why we sing for these kids who don't have a thing
except for a dream and a fuckin' rap magazine (ha-ha!)
who post pin-up pictures on they walls all day long
idolize they favorite rappers and know all they songs
or for anyone who's ever been through shit in they lives
so they sit and they cry at night, wishin' they'd die
'til they throw on a rap record and they sit and they vibe
we're nothin' to you, but we're the fuckin' shit in they eyes
that's why we seize the moment, try to freeze it and own it
squeeze it and hold it ‘cause we consider these minutes golden
and maybe they'll admit it when we're gone
just let our spirits live on
through our lyrics that you hear in our songs, so we can—


sing with me (sing!), sing for the year (sing it!)
sing for the laughter and sing for the tear (come on!)
sing it with me, it's just for today
maybe tomorrow the good lord will take you away
sing with me (sing!), sing for the year (sing it!)
sing for the laughter and sing for the tear (come on!)
sing it with me, it's just for today
maybe tomorrow the good lord will take you away

i'm a soldier
i'm a soldier (la-de-dah-dah, dah-dah, dah-dah)
i'm a soldier
i'm a soldier
yo


never was a thug, just infatuated with guns
never was a gangsta 'til i graduated to one
and got the rep of a villain, for weapon concealin'
took the image of a thug, kept shit appealin'
willin' to stick out my neck for respect
if it meant life or death, never live to regret what i said
when you're me, people just wanna see if it's true
if it's you—what you say in your raps, what you do
so they feel it's part of your obligation to fulfill
when they see you on the streets, face to face, are you for real?
in confrontation, ain't no conversation, if you feel
you're in violation, any hesitation'll get you killed
if you feel it, kill it; if you conceal it, reveal it
being reasonable'll leave you full of bullets, pull it
squeeze it 'til it's empty; tempt me, push me, pussies
i need a good reason to give this trigger a good squeeze


(i'm a soldier)
these shoulders hold up so much
they won't budge, i'll never fall or fold up
(i'm a soldier)
even if my collarbones crush or crumble
i will never slip or stumble
(i'm a soldier)
these shoulders hold up so much
they won't budge, i'll never fall or fold up
(i'm a soldier)
even if my collarbones crush or crumble
i will never stumble


i love pissin' you off, gets me off
like my lawyers when the fuckin' judge lets me off
all you motherfuckers gotta do is set me off
i'll violate and all the motherfuckin' bets be off
i'm a lit fuse, anything i do, bitch, it's news
pistol-whippin' motherfucking bouncers 6'2"
who needs bullets? as soon as i pull it, you sweat bullets
an excellent method to get rid of the next bully
it's actually better 'cause instead of you murderin'
you can hurt 'em and come back again and kick dirt at 'em
it's like pourin' salt in the wounds, assault and get sued
you can smell the lawsuits soon as i waltz in the room
everybody halts and stops, calls the cops
all you see is bitches comin' out their halter tops
runnin' and duckin' out the hot rocks parking lot
you'll all get shot, whether it's your fault or not, 'cause i'm a—

they won't budge, i'll never fall or fold up
(i'm a soldier)
even if my collarbones crush or crumble
i will never stumble


i spit it slow so these kids know that i'm talkin' to 'em
give it back to these damn critics and sock it to 'em
i'm like a thug with a little bit of pac influence
i spew it, and look how i got you bitches rockin' to it
you motherfuckers could never do it like i could do it
don't even try it, you'll look stupid, do not pursue it
don't ever in your life try to knock the truest
i spit the illest shit ever been dropped in two-inch
so ticky-tock, listen as the sound ticks on the clock
listen to the sound of kim as she licks on a cock
listen to the sound of me spillin' my heart through this pen
motherfuckers know that i'll never be marshall again
full of controversy until i retire my jersey
'til the fire inside dies and expires at thirty
and lord, have mercy on any more of these rappers that verse me
and put a curse on authorities, in the face of adversity, i'm a—

all these people i had to leave in limbo
i'm back now, i've come to release this info
i'll be brief, and let me just keep shit simple
canibitch don't want no beef with slim, no!
not even on my radar
so won't you please jump off my dick, lay off and stay off?

mush the senate's face and push this generation
of kids to stand and fight for the right to say somethin'
you might not like, this white hot light

do-si-do, oh, yo, ho, hello there!
oh yeah, don't think i won't go there

yeah, you laugh 'til your mothafuckin' ass gets drafted
while you're at band-camp thinkin' that crap can't happen
'til you fuck around, get an anthrax napkin
inside a package, wrapped in saran wrap wrappin'
open the plastic and then you stand back, gaspin'
fuckin' assassins hijackin' amtraks, crashin'
all this terror, america demands action
next thing you know, you've got uncle sam's ass askin'
to join the army or what you'll do for their navy
you just a baby gettin' recruited at 18
you're on a plane now, eatin' they food and their baked beans
i'm 28, they gon' take you 'fore they take me
crazy insane or insane crazy?
when i say, "hussein," you say, "shady"

nothin' moves me more than a groove that soothes me
nothin' soothes me more than a groove that boosts me
nothin' boosts me more or suits me beautifully
there's nothin' you can do to me, stab me, shoot at me! (woo-hoo!)
psychotic, hypnotic product, i got a the antibiotic
ain't nobody hotter and so on and yada-yada
god, i talk a lot of hem-de-lay-la-la-la
oochie-walla-walla, um-da-dah-da-dah-da, but you gotta-gotta

keep makin' new shit, produce hits to break

dr. dre wants to square dance with me

canadabis don't want no parts of me
dirty dozen wants to square dance with you
yeehaw! wee!

psst, hey, listen... haha (da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da)
i love my job (woo!)
makes me feel like ... superman! haha (da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da)
can you fly? i can, wanna see? psh

i'm only entertainin' you, my
goal is to stimulate, makin' you high
and take you and i
to a place that you can't see but i believe you can fly
i don't mean nobody harm, i'm just partyin'
i'm not your dad, not your mom, not your guardian
just the man who's on the mic
so let me entertain you (yeah)


my lyrical content is constantly under fire
no wonder why i constantly bomb back
to combat attacks with constant concepts
when lyrics are constantly took outta context
failure to communicate with congress has
been a problem for the longest, i guess, but
maybe one day we can make some progress
food for thought, see how long it takes to digest
feelin' good when i should be ashamed
shit, i really shoulda fell, but i stood, see, i came
like a flame in the night, like a ghost in the dark
there's a ray, there's a light, there's a hope, there's a spark
but when planets collide they'll never see eye to eye
until they decide to set their differences aside
and this is why only one of us will survive
so children, follow my lead and feel the vibe, because


i'm only entertainin' you, my
goal is to stimulate, makin' you high
and take you and i
to a place that you can't see but i believe you can fly
i don't mean nobody harm, i'm just partyin'
i'm not your dad, not your mom, not your guardian
just the man who's on the mic
so let me entertain you (yeah)


my music can be slightly amusin'
you shouldn't take lyrics so serious, it might be confusin'
tryin' to separate the truth from entertainment
it's stupid, ain't it? i get sick of tryin' to explain it
see, i could sit and argue with you, but it goes beyond
just being a snot, pointy-nosed bleach-blond
'cause i came here to uplift, let your woes be gone
tell 'em to get fucked and just mosey on
constantly movin', constantly usin'
the constitution as a form of restitution
bless the children, nothin' less than brilliant
let me entertain you like robbie williams
i'll be here when y'all are gone, rebuildin'
world revolvin', still evolvin', still slim
how many kids’ll copy? prob'ly millions
but i'ma do this as a fuckin' hobby 'til then, 'cause


i'm only entertainin' you, my
goal is to stimulate, makin' you high
and take you and i
to a place that you can't see but i believe you can fly
i don't mean nobody harm, i'm just partyin'
i'm not your dad, not your mom, not your guardian
just the man who's on the mic
so let me entertain you (yeah)


my lyrical content contains subject matter
that sucks up all these fucked-up young kids
at a alarming rate, common denominate
add it up, and you'll see just why i dominate
i try to stimulate, but kids emulate
and mimic every move you make, "slim, you great!"
but wait, can't you see i'm only here to entertain?
i gotta be the one to go against the grain
'cause, man, i see it, feel it, live it, but it's inhumane
for me to see you be influenced and pretend you ain't
but they don't understand that i've been through pain
if you get to know me i could be a friend you gain
but you can't just stand there and try to judge
it hurts but your jealousy probably tears you up inside as much
and it's such a pleasure, every button that i touch
i treasure every glutton that i punish in my lust, but


i'm only entertainin' you, my
goal is to stimulate, makin' you high
and take you and i
to a place that you can't see but i believe you can fly
i don't mean nobody harm, i'm just partyin'
i'm not your dad, not your mom, not your guardian
just the man who's on the mic
so let me entertain you (yeah)

we'll be friends, i'll call you again
i'll chase you around every bar you attend
never know what kinda car i'll be in
we'll see how much you'll be partyin' then
you don't want that, neither do i
i don't wanna flip when i see you with guys
too much pride, between you and i
not a jealous man, but females lie
but i guess that's just what sluts do
how could it ever be just us two?
i'd never love you enough to trust you
we just met and i just fucked you

i can't be your superman, can't be your superman
can't be your superman, your superman, your superman


first thing you say: i'm not fazed
i hang around big stars all day
i don't see what the big deal is anyway
you're just plain old marshall to me
ooh yeah, girl, run that game
hailie jade, i love that name
love that tattoo, what's that say?
"rot in pieces," uh, that's great
first off, you don't know marshall
at all, so don't grow partial
that's ammo for my arsenal
i'll slap you off that bar stool
there goes another lawsuit
leave handprints all across you
good lordy, whoadie
you must be gone off that water bottle
you want what you can't have
ooh girl, that's too damn bad
don't touch what you can't grab
end up with two backhands
put anthrax on a tampax
and slap you 'til you can't stand
girl, you just blew your chance
don't mean to ruin your plans


but i do know one thing though
bitches, they come, they go
saturday through sunday, monday
monday through sunday, yo
maybe i'll love you one day
maybe we'll someday grow
'til then just sit your drunk ass on that fuckin' runway, ho


‘cause i can't be your superman, can't be your superman
can't be your superman, can't be your superman
i can't be your superman, can't be your superman
can't be your superman, your superman, your superman
‘cause i can't be your superman, can't be your superman

it's all bad now, man
it's all bad
but y'all done fucked up now!
yeah!
haha!
new shit!
ayo
i just want
the whole world to know
that i did not start this
but i will finish it


comin' up, it never mattered what color you was
if you could spit, then you could spit
that's it, that's what it was
back when motherfuckers was straight backpackin'
cipherin', fightin' for life in this rap
for the mic to get passed, and you psyched and you gassed
then you hype, ‘cause you last
and you might whoop some ass; if you lost, then you lost
shake hands like a man and you swallowed it
when the unsigned hype column in
the source was like our only source of light
when the mics used to mean somethin', a four was like
you were the shit, now it's like the least you get
three and a half now just means you're a piece of shit
four and a half or five means you're biggie, jigga, nas
or benzino—shit, i don't even think you realize
you're playin' with motherfuckers' lives
i done watched dre get fucked on the chronic
probably ‘cause i was on it
now you fucked me out of my mics twice, i let it slide
i said i wouldn't hold my fuckin' breath to get a five
shit, i was right, i'da fuckin' died already tryin'
i swear to god, i never lie, i bet it's why
you let that bitch give me that bullshit review
i sat and took it, i ain't look at the shit, we knew
you'd probably try and fuck us with obie and 50 too
(*spit*) fuck a relationship! we through!
no more source to street cred, them days is dead
ray's got ak's to dave mays's head
every issue there's an eight-page made men spread
will somebody please tell whoever braids his head
that i am not afraid, you're just a fuckin' waste of lead
on my pencil, for me to write some shit this simple
so listen closely, as i break it down and proceed
this o.g's 'bout to get smoked like rolled weed
you don't know me or my motherfuckin' mother
you motherfuckin' punk!
put me on your fuckin' cover just to sell your little sell-out mag
i ain't mad, i feel bad, here's an ad
here's a poster of ray-ray and his dad
you wanna talk about some shit
that you don't know about, yeah?
let's talk about how you're puttin' your own son out there
to try to eat off him because you missed your boat
you're never gonna blow, bitch, you're just too old
no wonder you're sore now, lordy, you're bored now
i'm pushin' 30, you're kickin' 40's door down
bitch, this is war now, and you'll never beat me
all you do is cheat me out of quotables
but you know that you'll always see me on your tv
‘cause you've got to stay up 'til three in the mornin'
to see your video played once on bet
so, hee-hee, hee, who has the last laugh? aftermath, yeah
so, on behalf of our whole staff, kiss our asshole cracks
we'll never fold or hold back
just know that benzino's wack; no matter how many times i say his name, he'll never blow, jack
you're better off tryin' to bring rso back
look at your track record, that's how far it goes back
it's extortion, and ray owns a portion
so, half of the staff up there is fresh out of jail from boston
bullyin' and bossin' dave like a slave
they completely brainwashed him, and forced him to stay
locked in his own office
afraid of the softest, fakest, wannabe gangsta in new york
and it's pitiful, ‘cause i would have never said shit if you'd
have kept your mouth shut, bitch, now what?
hit it, clue! spit it, slay! new shit, exclusive
yo, lantern, yo, whoo kid
you know what to do with this
use it, i'm through, this is stupid
i can't believe i stooped to this bullshit to do this
and who you callin' a bitch, bitch?!,
you owe me!

america! ha ha ha! we love you
how many people are proud to be citizens
of this beautiful country of ours, the stripes and the stars
for the rights that men have died for to protect?
the women and men who have broke their necks
for the freedom of speech the united states government has sworn to uphold… or so we're told
(yo, i want everybody to listen to the words of this song)


i never would've dreamed in a million years i'd see
so many motherfuckin' people who feel like me
who share the same views and the same exact beliefs
it's like a fuckin' army marchin' in back of me
so many lives i touched, so much anger aimed
in no particular direction, just sprays and sprays
and straight through your radio waves, it plays and plays
'til it stays stuck in your head for days and days
who would've thought standin' in this mirror, bleachin' my hair
with some peroxide, reachin' for a t-shirt to wear
that i would catapult to the forefront of rap like this?
how could i predict my words would have an impact like this?
i must've struck a chord with somebody up in the office
'cause congress keep tellin' me i ain't causin' nothin' but problems
and now they're sayin' i'm in trouble with the government
i'm lovin' it, i shoveled shit all my life, and now i'm dumpin' it on


white america, i could be one of your kids
white america, little eric looks just like this
white america, erica loves my shit
i go to trl, look how many hugs i get (yo)
white america, i could be one of your kids
white america, little eric looks just like this
white america, erica loves my shit
i go to trl, look how many hugs i get


look at these eyes, baby blue, baby just like yourself
if they were brown, shady'd lose, shady sits on the shelf
but shady's cute, shady knew shady's dimples would help
make ladies swoon, baby, ooh, baby! look at my sales
let's do the math: if i was black, i would've sold half
i ain't have to graduate from lincoln high school to know that
but i could rap, so fuck school, i'm too cool to go back
give me the mic, show me where the fuckin' studio's at
when i was underground, no one gave a fuck i was white
no labels wanted to sign me, almost gave up, i was like
"fuck it," until i met dre, the only one to look past
gave me a chance and i lit a fire up under his ass
helped him get back to the top, every fan black that i got
was probably his in exchange for every white fan that he's got
like damn, we just swapped, sittin' back lookin' at shit, wow
i'm like my skin is it startin' to work to my benefit now? it's—


white america, i could be one of your kids
white america, little eric looks just like this
white america, erica loves my shit
i go to trl, look how many hugs i get (yo)
white america, i could be one of your kids
white america, little eric looks just like this
white america, erica loves my shit
i go to trl, look how many hugs i get


see, the problem is, i speak to suburban kids
who otherwise would've never knew these words exist
whose moms probably would've never gave two squirts of piss
'til i created so much motherfuckin' turbulence
straight out the tube, right into your livin' rooms i came
and kids flipped when they knew i was produced by dre
that's all it took, and they were instantly hooked right in
and they connected with me too because i looked like them
that's why they put my lyrics up under this microscope
searchin' with a fine tooth comb, it's like this rope
waitin' to choke, tightenin' around my throat
watchin' me while i write this, like, "i don't like this note!"
all i hear is: lyrics, lyrics, constant controversy
sponsors workin' 'round the clock to try to stop my concerts early
surely hip-hop was never a problem in harlem, only in boston
after it bothered the fathers of daughters startin' to blossom
so now i'm catchin' the flak from these activists when they raggin'
actin' like i'm the first rapper to smack a bitch or say "faggot," shit
just look at me like i'm your closest pal
the poster child, the motherfuckin' spokesman now, for—


white america, i could be one of your kids
white america, little eric looks just like this
white america, erica loves my shit
i go to trl, look how many hugs i get! (yo)
white america, i could be one of your kids
white america, little eric looks just like this
white america, erica loves my shit
i go to trl, look how many hugs i get


so to the parents of america, i am the derringer
aimed at little erica to attack her character
the ringleader of this circus of worthless pawns
sent to lead the march right up to the steps of congress
and piss on the lawns of the white house
to burn the *galf*​​ and replace it with a parental advisory sticker
to spit liquor in the faces of this democracy of hypocrisy
fuck you, ms. cheney! fuck you, tipper gore!
fuck you with the freest of speech this divided states of embarrassment will allow me to have! fuck you!
ha ha ha, i'm just playin', america
you know i love you

i've created a monster
'cause nobody wants to see marshall no more, they want shady, i'm chopped liver
well, if you want shady, this is what i'll give ya
a little bit of weed mixed with some hard liquor
some vodka that'll jump-start my heart quicker
than a shock when i get shocked at the hospital
by the doctor when i'm not cooperating
when i'm rockin' the table while he's operating (hey!)
you waited this long, now stop debating
'cause i'm back, i'm on the rag and ovulating
i know that you got a job, ms. cheney
but your husband's heart problem's complicating
so the fcc won't let me be
or let me be me, so let me see
they tried to shut me down on mtv
but it feels so empty without me
so come on and dip, bum on your lips
fuck that, cum on your lips and some on your tits
and get ready, 'cause this shit's about to get heavy
i just settled all my lawsuits (fuck you, debbie!)


now, this looks like a job for me
so everybody, just follow me
'cause we need a little controversy
'cause it feels so empty without me
i said this looks like a job for me
so everybody, just follow me
'cause we need a little controversy
'cause it feels so empty without me


little hellions, kids feeling rebellious
embarrassed, their parents still listen to elvis
they start feelin' like prisoners, helpless
'til someone comes along on a mission and yells, "bitch!"
a visionary, vision is scary
could start a revolution, pollutin' the airwaves
a rebel, so just let me revel and bask
in the fact that i got everyone kissin' my ass
and it's a disaster, such a catastrophe
for you to see so damn much of my ass, you asked for me?
well, i'm back, da-na-na-na, na-na-na-na-na-na
fix your bent antenna, tune it in, and then i'm gonna
enter in and up under your skin like a splinter
the center of attention, back for the winter
i'm interesting, the best thing since wrestling
infesting in your kid's ears and nesting
testing, "attention, please"
feel the tension soon as someone mentions me
here's my ten cents, my two cents is free
a nuisance, who sent? you sent for me?


now, this looks like a job for me
so everybody, just follow me
'cause we need a little controversy
'cause it feels so empty without me
i said this looks like a job for me
so everybody, just follow me
'cause we need a little controversy
'cause it feels so empty without me


a tisket, a tasket, i'll go tit-for-tat wit'
anybody who's talkin', "this shit, that shit"
chris kirkpatrick, you can get your ass kicked
worse than them little limp bizkit bastards
and moby? you can get stomped by obie
you thirty-six-year-old bald-headed fag, blow me
you don't know me, you're too old, let go
it's over, nobody listens to techno
now, let's go, just give me the signal
i'll be there with a whole list full of new insults
i've been dope, suspenseful with a pencil
ever since prince turned himself into a symbol
but, sometimes, the shit just seems
everybody only wants to discuss me
so this must mean i'm disgusting
but it's just me, i'm just obscene (yeah)
though i'm not the first king of controversy
i am the worst thing since elvis presley
to do black music so selfishly
and use it to get myself wealthy (hey!)
there's a concept that works
twenty million other white rappers emerge
but no matter how many fish in the sea
it'd be so empty without me


now, this looks like a job for me
so everybody, just follow me
'cause we need a little controversy
'cause it feels so empty without me
i said this looks like a job for me
so everybody, just follow me
'cause we need a little controversy
'cause it feels so empty without me
