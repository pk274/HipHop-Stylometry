yo, check it out
it's fucked up
'cause i don't see either one of us budging


"i'm withholdi-in' my anger, though i'd like to be the strangler
of this punk ass little pussy's puny neck
it's my right to insist, that he acknowledge my existence
but he just displays complete lack of respect"
that's what he says to himself, as he uses his magazines to trash me
as he sits with both his feet up at his desk
smokes a bag of his weed and starts imaginin' things
and he just can't see that he's maniacally depressed
and in his jealousy and envy it just whirls him in a frenzy
as he turns on mtv and sees my face
he don't exist in this world, so he just twists and he twirls
spirals and spins, 'til he hurls himself into a rage
and it's destroyin' him slowly, 'cause he does not even know me
even though he sees me everywhere he goes
so he just tortures himself, he has no fortune and wealth
so he extorts someone else to get his dough
and now he's actin' like a bully, so he tries to push and pull me
but he knows that he can't fool me so he's mad
and he has no choice but to scream and raise his voice up at me
'cause it annoys him to see that i ain't scared


you ain't no motherfuckin' bully
and i ain't bowin' to no motherfuckin' bully
i won't allow it, ain't gon' cower to no bully
i'll be damned if i don't stand up to a bully
fight like a man and throw my hands up to a bully
and i know it must be fuckin' wit' you emotionally


now i'm not tryin' to make no more enemies, no more unfortunately
there's so many other motherfuckers there just are
they just keep houndin' at me now that i'm down with 50
suddenly now i got beef with this faggot ja (ha-ha-ha-ha)
but his ass is such a puppet, irv could shove his whole hand up it
and just make him say what he wants him to say
but suge has irv on a string, and irv's so nervous that he
says anything to this man to keep him at bay
so now ja thinks that he's so tough and murder inc.'s the big bad wolf
and they go huff, and puff, and blow our label down
but our building's made out of bricks, so you ain't takin' out shit,
and, dawg, you just did a song with bobby brown,
so now you try to pull the race card, and it backfires in your face hard
'cause you know we don't play that black and white shit
plus the stylist you fucked, when you was ecstasied up
was just a man who's dressed up as a white bitch,


you ain't no motherfuckin' bully
and i ain't bowin' to no motherfuckin' bully
i won't allow it, ain't gon' cower to no bully
i'll be damned if i don't stand up to a bully
fight like a man and throw my hands up to a bully
you must be takin' too much e

now what bothers me the most about hip-hop is we're so close
to pickin' up where we left off with big and pac
we just lost jam master j, big l got blasted away
plus we lost bugz, slang ton, and freaky tah
it's like a never-ending cycle that just seems to come full circle
everybody's gotta be so fuckin' hard
and i'm not excludin' myself, 'cause i been stupid as well
i been known to lose it, when someone says something smart
but as we grow as men, we learn to let shit go, but then again
there's only so much bullshit we can really stand
we all got reps to uphold, when someone steps on our toes
it's no exception, it goes for every man
but if irv really gave a fuck about ja, like he claims he does
he'd wake him up and make his boy get off them drugs
but he just keeps feedin' him pills, so if that e doesn't kill him
someone from g-unit will, and i ain't buzzed
dawg, i'm talkin' to you straight: if the situation escalates
any worse, we're gonna lose another soldier to this game
and if i get killed for this rap, i got a million in cash
that says i will get you back in hailie's name


you ain't no motherfuckin' bully
and i ain't bowin' to no motherfuckin' bully
i won't allow it, ain't gon' cower to no bully
i'll be damned if i don't stand up to a bully
fight like a man and throw my hands up to a bully
irvine, get your boy off of that e


get at me, dawg
holla

nigga, hahaha (oh!)
(yeah) yeah
(here we go again)
shady, haha (shady records mixtape)
50 cent (the invasion)
g-g-g-g-g-unit (part two) haha
here we go again (conspiracy theory
international version) yeah, (
everybody's in a rush to try to get the throne
i just get on the track and try to set the tone (come on)
i ain't tryin' to use nobody as a steppin' stone
but don't compare me, i'm better off just left alone (exclusive)
and i ain't even tryin' to go there with record sales
i'm just tryin' to keep it humble and respect myself (yeah)
say, "what up?", keep steppin', and just rep d12
keep my nose clean, stay away from weapons, jail
and livin' reckless, but if you go check my belt
you may see something else i use to protect myself (yeah)
a vest, to stop a ruger and deflect the shells (green lantern)
and send 'em back at you faster than they left the barrels
and i don't even carry guns no more, i don't got to
got undercover cops that'll legally pop you
and i done seen a lot of people cross the line (uh-huh)
but this motherfucker ja must have lost his mind (woo)
that x got him thinkin' he was dmx
then he switched to 'pac, now he's tryna be him next
so which one are you? x, luther, pac or michael?
just keep singin' that same song, recycled
we'd all much rather get along than fight you
me and hailie dance to your songs, we like you
and you don't really wanna step inside no mic booth (uh-huh)
come on now, you know the white boy'll bite you
i hurt your pride dawg and you know i don't like to
but i will if i have to, with syllable after
syllable i just slap ya, killin' you faster
than you poppin' pill after little pill of them tabs
of that shit you on, but if you want it, you got it
you'd bump this shit too, if we ain't diss you on it
but if we lock horns we can charge harder than busta (green lantern!)
we bump heads with any motherfucker that wants to (yeah)
so what's the deal, where was all the tough talk?
when i walked up to you like, "ja, what up dawg?"
how come you didn't say you had a problem then?
when you was standin' there with all your men, we coulda solved it then
i'm a grown man, dawg, come holla
all you did was slap hands, smile and swallow
another one of them little x pills in front of me
and tell me 50 cent was everything you wanna be
come on


i know you don't want it with me
you know you don't want it with me
you can talk but soon we gon' see
you don't wanna bump heads with me
i know you don't want it with me
you know you don't want it with me
you can talk but soon we gon' see
you don't wanna bump heads with me (tony!)


i know you don't want it with me
you know you don't want it with me
you can talk but soon we gon' see
you don't wanna bump heads with me
i know you don't want it with me
you know you don't want it with me
you can talk but soon we gon' see
you don't wanna bump heads with me (lloyd banks!)



(i, i wanna grow up too)
"uncle marshall, will you tell us a bedtime story?"
here we go!

now, once upon a time not long ago
there was a little rapper about to blow
but his album came, and it was not good
i think it went lead or double copper-wood
so these silly little fans, they were misled
by a nerdy internet computer hip-hop head
"me and you, clef, we're gonna make some cash."
"grab this silver paint and just paint my ass."
hey, mister, would you care to bear witness to
the ass-whippin' i'm about to administer
to this ass-kissin' little vaginal blister?
stanibus, little marshall mathers' sister
and in this corner, we have the "mr
not-havin'-it," it's the mad, sinister
dr. evil, with his bag of tricks for
this little antagonistic faggot
dick-sucking ex-ll cool j fan from windsor
i'm 'bout to murder little kenny-fag-kaniff-sta
you bastard, i ain't wanna have to diss ya
canibus, where the fuck you at? i miss ya!


canibitch, oh, canibitch
wherefore art thou, canibitch?
please tell me what happened with
that style that you were rappin' with
canibitch, oh, canibitch
are you from los angeles
new york, or just a janitor
from canada? oh, canibitch


now, at first, i ain't really understand this shit
picture me, for a second, and imagine it
chillin' in the bat mansion relaxin' when
all of a sudden some bullshit comes across the scanners, it's
canibitch, on some 'stan lives' shit
it creeped me out at first; man, this is sick
but me, bein' just as sick, this conflict
gets my dick harder than arithmetic
and i know how you jealous ones envy
i shoulda knew better from the first few letters you sent me
the first two letters, you were tellin' me shit like
you respect me, like any other regular mc
the third letter, you asked how come i ain't return
none of the messages at shady records you left me
the fourth letter: "slim, you're really startin' to upset me."
the fifth letter told me you were comin' to get me
the sixth letter, there's a bomb threat on our building
this crazy motherfucker's really tryna kill me
so i went back and read the first few letters that said
some shit about a message you left
oh shit! that's not a e, that's an a!
this dude wants to leave me a 'massage,' he's gay!
right away, i'm on the phone with dr. dre
"we got a bogey," "marshall, i'm on the way."


canibitch, oh, canibitch
wherefore art thou, canibitch?
please tell me what happened with
that style that you were rappin' with
canibitch, oh, canibitch
are you from los angeles
new york, or just a janitor
from canada? oh, canibitch


so, in two seconds flat, dre's at my crib
only thing is, we both know where this kid lives
and neither one of us have canadian citizenship
"shit. oh, dre, wait a minute, that's it!
all we gotta do is use a bit of turbo-boost
we can fly over the border!" "let's go!" 
canibitch, oh, canibitch
wherefore art thou, canibitch?
please tell me what happened with
that style that you were rappin' with
canibitch, oh, canibitch
are you from los angeles
new york, or just a janitor
from canada? oh, canibitch

so we gonna beef, and keep on beefin' unless
you're gonna agree to meet with me in the flesh
and settle this face-to-face, and you're gonna see

it doesn't take much for me to raise such a stank up
when motherfuckers hate your guts
you ain't even gotta say much
for me to put a pen to a blank sheet of paper
is like smearin' bloodstains with a paintbrush
i can’t explain what it is my brain does
but however it works, it's insane, it's plain nuts
and it ain't just my brain that’s dangerous
it’s a whole combination of things, it takes nuts
and i’m not afraid to raise the stakes up
i got a million bucks in the bank and eight trucks
for anybody who gets on a track and spanks us
i'm patiently waitin' for the day, i’m anxious
to see the look on your fake mugs when you thugs go bankrupt
you're drunk, you ain't tough
whatever you drank must of just turned you into some gangstas
this is me talkin', motherfucker, this ain’t drugs
you wanna pop shit, wake up then make up?
fuck that! it’s too late chump, now face up
i pray for the day that someone who spits
with the caliber that nas and jay does
opens up his jaws to say somethin' or rattle my name off
or rattle the first thing from the top of his brain off
so, i can blow the fuckin' dust off of this chainsaw
and give him the surgery that he came for
'til i peel the paint off, i never been shot
but i think me and 50 must've been cut from the same cloth
'cause i've always came off like ja's chain
when they tried to rush him and lost and came back
and gave him a watch in exchange for it
i don’t stop, only thing that i wait for
is the day that i ain't gotta report to probate court
'cause i'ma give you all a reason to hate more
'cause i been holdin' my tongue 'til i got a sprained jaw
a lot of rappers on my list, it just ain’t ja
and i'ma read that motherfucker off come april
you pussies think i went soft 'cause 8 mile
when i come back, i’ll be shootin' more than just paintballs
trust me


monkey see, monkey do
don't ever make the first move, just let 'em come to you
'cause they gon' always see and do what the other one do
so let 'em come to you, the rest'll just follow suit
monkey see, monkey do
tweedle-dee, tweedle-dum
if they really want it bad enough, well, then they gon' come
now here they come like we expected, now we just set 'em up
