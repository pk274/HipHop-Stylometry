you're walkin' down a horror corridor
it's almost four in the mornin' and you're in a
nightmare, it's horrible, right there's the coroner
waiting for ya to turn the corner so he can corner ya
you're a goner, he's onto ya
out the corner of his cornea, he just saw ya run
all you want is to rest 'cause you can't run anymore, you're done
all he wants is to kill you in front of an audience
while everybody is watching in the party, applauding it
here i sit, while i'm caught up in deep thought again
contemplating my next plot again
swallowin' a klonopin while i'm noddin' in and out on the ottoman
at the ramada inn, holding onto the pill bottle, then
lick my finger and swirl it 'round the bottom
and make sure i got all of it
wake up naked at mcdonald's with
blood all over me, dead bodies behind the counter, shit
guess i must've just blacked out again—not again!


it's 3 a.m. in the mornin'
put my key in the door and
bodies layin' all over the floor and
i don't remember how they got there
but i guess i must've killed 'em, killed 'em
i said, it's 3 a.m. in the mornin'
put my key in the door and
bodies layin' all over the floor and
i don't remember how they got there
but i guess i must've killed 'em, killed 'em


sitting nude in my living room, it's almost noon
i wonder what's on the tube, maybe they'll show some boobs
surfing every channel until i find hannah montana then
i reach for the aloe and lanolin, bust all over the wall panellin'
dismantlin' every candle on top of the fireplace mantel and
grab my flannel and my bandana, then
kiss the naked mannequin man again
you can see him standin' in my front window if you look in
i'm just a hooligan who's used to using hallucinogens
causin' illusions again, brain contusions again
cutting and bruising the skin, razors, scissors, and pins
jesus, when does it end? phases that i go through
dazed and i'm so confused
days that i don't know who gave these molecules to
me, what am i gon' do?
hey, the prodigal son, the diabolical one
very methodical when i slaughter them


it's 3 a.m. in the mornin'
put my key in the door and
bodies layin' all over the floor and
i don't remember how they got there
but i guess i must've killed 'em, killed 'em
i said, it's 3 a.m. in the mornin'
put my key in the door and
bodies layin' all over the floor and
i don't remember how they got there
but i guess i must've killed 'em, killed 'em


she puts the lotion in the bucket
it puts the lotion on the skin
or else it gets the hose again
she puts the lotion in the bucket
it puts the lotion on the skin
or else it gets the hose again


i cut and i slash, slice and gash, last night was a blast
i can't quite remember when i had that
much fun off a half-pint of the jack, my last vic and-a-half
a flashlight up kim kardashian's ass
i remember the first time i dismembered a family member
december, i think it was, i was having drinks with my cousin
i wrapped him in christmas lights
pushed him into the stinkin' tub, cut him up into pieces
and just when i went to drink his blood
i thought, "i oughta drink his bathwater, that oughta be fun"
that's when my days of serial murder manslaughter begun
the sight of blood excites me, that might be an artery, son
your blood-curdling screams just don't seem to bother me none
it's 3 a.m. and here i come, so you should probably run
a secret passageway around here, man, there's got to be one
oh no, there's probably none
he can scream all that he wants, top of his lungs
but ain't no stopping me from chopping him up-up, 'cause…


it's 3 a.m. in the mornin'
put my key in the door and
bodies layin' all over the floor and
i don't remember how they got there
but i guess i must've killed 'em, killed 'em
i said, it's 3 a.m. in the mornin'
put my key in the door and
bodies layin' all over the floor and
i don't remember how they got there
but i guess i must've killed 'em, killed 'em


yo, yo, ayo (evil… rise)

oh, it's music to my ears, oh, man
how can i describe the way i feel?
fucking great, man
okay, let me see
how could i begin?


locked in mariah's wine cellar, all i had for lunch
was bread, wine, more bread, wine and captain crunch
red wine for breakfast and for brunch
and to soak it up, an in-between snack, crackers to munch
mariah, what's ever happened to us?
why did we have to break up?
all i asked for was a glass of punch
you see, i never really asked for much
i can't imagine what's going through your mind after such
a nasty break-up with that latin hunk
luis miguel, nick cannon, better back the fuck up
i'm not playin', i want her back, you punk
this is hello kitty bedspread, satin funk
mixed with egyptian, with a little rap and punk
zapp and eric clapton, shaft, frank zappa, crunk
and, yeah, baby, i want another crack at ya
you can beat me with any spatula that you want
i mean, i really want you bad, you cunt
nick, you had your fun, i've come to kick you in your sack of junk
man, i could use a fresh batch of blood
so prepare your vernacular for dracula acupuncture


bagpipes from baghdad
when will it ever cease?
for pete's sakes, he's crazy to say the least
bagpipes from baghdad
what's going through my mind
half the time, when i rhyme, or blowing up like
bagpipes from baghdad
somebody turn the vacancy sign on
'cause i'm gone, blowing on my
bagpipes from baghdad
i run the streets and act like a madman holding a glad—


you can be a permanent fixture in my lyrical mixture
i'm the miracle whip trickster
my signature sound, when a tube of lipstick's around
i'm bound to put it on in an instant, wow
man, what an ensemble!
what an assortment of pharma–ceuticals
this beautiful pill dust in my palm, my
cuticles get residue just from touchin' the bottle
never knew i could remind me so much of my momma
i'll cut ya like dahmer, pull a butcher knife on ya
the size of a sword, boy, i'm like the fuckin' red sonja
get it stuck in your cornea, nice knowing ya, norman
you're so fuckin' annoyin', drop the shovel, boy
you don't know what the fuck you're doin'
i ain't playin' no fuckin' more
nick cannon, you prick, i wish you luck with the fuckin' whore
every minute there's a sucker born, snuck up on malachai
made the motherfucker suck on a shuck of corn
shuck o', shuck o' corn, chaka khan
hit jason in the face with a hockey puck, and
told him it's fuckin' on, man, what the fuck are ya doin'?
you're runnin' over the snowblower with the lawnmower
blowin' your bagpipes from baghdad

in the bed with two brain-dead lesbian vegetables
i bet you they become heterosexual
nothing will stop me from molestin' you
titty-fuckin' you 'til your breast nipple flesh tickles my testicles
is what i said to the two conjoined twins
how's it going, girlfriends? you needs a boyfriend?
you need some ointment? just set up an appointment
who's gonna see the doctor first? we'll do a coin flip
i just got my one-year sobriety coin chip
when the bad get going, how bad does the going get?
baby, you shouldn't have any trouble rubbing groins with
each other, especially when you're joined at the hip
i'm going to get the needle and thread from the sewing kit
and attempt to separate 'em and stitch 'em back at the loin, shit
lure the little boy with the chocolate 'chips ahoy!' chip
cookie, lookie, even took me a polaroid pic

i'm just so fucking depressed
i just can't seem to get out this slump
if i could just get over this hump
but i need something to pull me out this dump
i took my bruises, took my lumps
fell down then i got right back up
but i need that spark to get psyched back up
in order for me to pick the mic back up
i don't know how or why or when
i ended up in this position i'm in
i'm starting to feel distant again
so i decided just to pick this pen
up and try to make an attempt
to vent, but i just can't admit
or come to grips with the fact that
i may be done with rap, i need a new outlet
and i know some shit's so hard to swallow
but i just can't sit back and wallow
in my own sorrow, but i know one fact:
i'll be one tough act to follow
one tough act to follow
i'll be one tough act to follow
here today, gone tomorrow
but you'd have to walk a thousand miles—


in my shoes, just to see
what it's like to be me
i'll be you, let's trade shoes
just to see what it'd be like to
feel your pain, you feel mine
go inside each other's minds
just to see what we find
look at shit through each other's eyes


but don't let 'em say you ain't beautiful, oh
they can all get fucked, just stay true to you, so
don't let 'em say you ain't beautiful, oh
they can all get fucked, just stay true to you, so


i think i'm startin' to lose my sense of humor
everything's so tense and gloom
i almost feel like i gotta check the temperature
of the room, just as soon as
i walk in, it's like all eyes on me
so i try to avoid any eye contact
'cause if i do that, then it opens a door
for conversation like i want that
i'm not lookin' for extra attention
i just wanna be just like you
blend in with the rest of the room
maybe just point me to the closest restroom
i don't need no fuckin' man servant
tryna follow me around and wipe my ass
laugh at every single joke i crack
and half of 'em ain't even funny, like, "ha!
marshall, you're so funny, man
you should be a comedian, goddamn!"
unfortunately i am
i just hide behind the tears of a clown
so why don't you all sit down?
listen to the tale i'm about to tell
hell, we don't gotta trade our shoes
and you ain't gotta walk no thousand miles—


in my shoes, just to see
what it's like to be me
i'll be you, let's trade shoes
just to see what it'd be like to
feel your pain, you feel mine
go inside each other's minds
just to see what we find
look at shit through each other's eyes


but don't let 'em say you ain't beautiful, oh
they can all get fucked, just stay true to you, so
don't let 'em say you ain't beautiful, oh
they can all get fucked, just stay true to you, so

nobody asked for life to deal us
with these bullshit hands we're dealt
we gotta take these cards ourselves
and flip 'em, don't expect no help
now, i could've either just sat
on my ass and pissed and moaned
or take this situation in which i'm placed in
and get up and get my own
i was never the type of kid
to wait by the door and pack his bags
and sat on the porch and hoped and prayed
for a dad to show up who never did
i just wanted to fit in
in every single place, every school i went
i dreamed of being that cool kid
even if it meant actin' stupid
aunt edna always told me:
"keep making that face, it'll get stuck like that."
meanwhile, i'm just standin' there
holdin' my tongue, tryin' to talk like this
'til i stuck my tongue on that frozen
stop sign pole at eight-years-old
i learned my lesson then, 'cause i wasn't
tryin' to impress my friends no mo'
but i already told you my whole life story
not just based on my description
'cause where you see it from where you're sittin'
it's probably a 110% different
i guess we would have to walk a
mile in each other's shoes at least
what size you wear? i wear 10's
let's see if you can fit your feet—


in my shoes, just to see
what it's like to be me
i'll be you, let's trade shoes
just to see what it'd be like to
feel your pain, you feel mine
go inside each other's minds
just to see what we find
look at shit through each other's eyes


but don't let 'em say you ain't beautiful, oh
they can all get fucked, just stay true to you, so
don't let 'em say you ain't beautiful, oh
they can all get fucked, just stay true to you, so


lately i've been hard to reach
i've been too long on my own (oh)
everybody has a private world
where they can be alone (so)
are you calling me?
are you tryin' to get through? (oh)
are you reaching out for me?
i'm reaching out for you (so)


yeah
to my babies:
stay strong
your dad'll be home soon
and to the rest of the world:
god gave you shoes
to fit you
so put 'em on and wear 'em
be yourself, man
be proud of who you are
even if it sounds corny
don't never let no one tell you
you ain't beautiful (so-oh-oh-oh-oh)

better watch out, sucker, now i got you where i want ya
onslaught coming, and i'm packing in my lunch a
bunch of missile launchers and a bunch of contra–
–band, van full of ganja; now, come on, jump
man, stop moshin' marshall; oh my god, ya
doing the cha-cha and the cucaracha with a quadra–
–plegic, boogying down to frank sinatra
lindsay to the lohan, lick it while you let me watch ya
who'da knew the buddha'd do to me what it's done?
such cynicism when there’s izm in my system
blunt hypnotism, lift the spliff up to my lips, son
so much on my hands, i got to give my kids a fist bump
christo-pher reeves swimmin' in my swim trunks
"mister – help me", is what he said to me, and then sunk
women, skinning them and cutting them up in chunks
in comes the woman with cocoa butter skin, once


once again, they call me buffalo bill
buffalo bill, buffa-buffalo bill
skin 'em up, hem 'em, sew 'em up in those kilts
up in those kilts, uppa-up in those kilts
man, you don't want to go up in those hills
up in those hills, uppa-up in those hills
you better beware, stay clear of buffalo bill
buffalo bill, buffa-buffalo bill


always, you can see him lurkin' in the hallways
carcasses of caucasian females in his crawl space
how the hell did he fit 'em all into such a small place?
hide 'em in the wall, well, how long will the drywall take?
well, fuck it then, i got nothing but time, i'll wait
until it dries, for the moment, i guess you're all safe
after i sand it and buff it i guess that i'll paint
my chainsaw's out of gas, my regular saw ain't
now, here i come again, damn stomach rumbling
you can even hear the evil spirits coming from within
someone's in the back of my damn house, rummaging
it's a girl, she looks pretty thin, but i want her skin
vinn— on the hunt again, when will it ever end?
evelyn, why you trying to fight? you will never win
severin' legs, arms; damn, there goes another limb
pull the lever, then; trapdoor, death is evident


once again, they call me buffalo bill
buffalo bill, buffa-buffalo bill
skin 'em up, hem 'em, sew 'em up in those kilts
up in those kilts, uppa-up in those kilts
man, you don't want to go up in those hills
up in those hills, uppa-up in those hills
you better beware, stay clear of buffalo bill
buffalo bill, buffa-buffalo bill


now, what you know about buffalo bill?
nothin', so chill
fuckin' ho, you better fuckin' hold still
make sure none of that lotion in the bucket don't spill
cut 'em, gut 'em, and just get to stuffin' those girls
man, i think she had enough of those pills
sedate her, then i wait, i come back later
just a-clutching those steel
blades, baby, when i cut ya don't squeal
i hate the loud noises, i fuckin' told you!
i keep hearing voices, like
"wouldn't you like to go and get your butcher knife
and push it right through her
while you put your shish kebab skewers into her
barbecue her, would you do to her
what you usually do to a girl whose skin's newer?"
in a world of sin you are, this is turning into a
torment tournament of sorts, christmas ornament you are
i'll be sure to ginsu ya 'til there's no more skin to ya
boo-yah! who ya think you're fucking with?
duck, because here he comes again


once again, they call me buffalo bill
buffalo bill, buffa-buffalo bill
skin 'em up, hem 'em, sew 'em up in those kilts
up in those kilts, uppa-up in those kilts
man, you don't want to go up in those hills
up in those hills, uppa-up in those hills
you better beware, stay clear of buffalo bill

"breaking news: detroit rapper eminem cancels his sold-out european tour to check himself into rehab after admitting an addiction to sleep medication
we'll have more on this story as it develops"
"shady records recording artist obie trice has apparently survived a gunshot to the head in what appears to be a random drive-by shooting...
....meanwhile, eminem is rumored to be..."
"...the on and off again relationship with..."
"this just in, a tour bus involving eminem's ent—"
"updating a story we brought you earlier about gunfire at an after-hours club, we've learned that the rapper proof has been fatally shot..."
"...shady/aftermath recording artist..."
"...long-time best friend of eminem and a member of the rap group d12..."
"d12, back in the news again today..."
"is it a sabbatical or the end? the rumors and speculation continue to swirl around eminem
he insists he's just taking a break, but doubters believe he's retiring, leaving us all to ask, 'will the real slim shady please stand up?'"


so this is it, this is what i wished for
just isn't how i envisioned it, fame to the point of imprisonment
i just thought the shit'd be different
but somethin' changed the minute that i got a whiff of it
i started to inhale it, smell it, started sniffin' it
and it became my cocaine, i just couldn't quit
i just wanted a little bit, then it turned me to a monster
i became a hypocrite, concert after concert
i was rakin' in the dough, rollin' in green
had the game hemmed up, like a sewin' machine
but i was losin' my freedom, there was nowhere for me
to not go and be seen, and just go and be me
and there was no in-between, you either loved it or hate it
every cd, critics gave it a three, then three
years later they go back and re-rate it
and call the slim shady lp the greatest
the marshall mathers was a classic
the eminem show was fantastic
but encore just didn't have the caliber to match it
i guess enough time just ain't passed yet
a couple more years, that shit'll be illmatic
and eight years later, i'm still at it
divorced, re-married, a felon, a father, sleepin' pill addict
and this is real talk, i feel like the incredible hulk
my back has been broke and i can still walk


so be careful what you wish for, 'cause you just might get it
and if you get it, then you just might not know what to do with it
'cause it might just come back on you ten-fold
i said, "be careful what you wish for, 'cause you just might get it
and if you get it, then you just might not know what to do with it
'cause it might just come back on you ten-fold"


i got a letter from a fan that said
he's been prayin' for me
every day and for some reason, it's been weighin'
on my mind heavy, 'cause i don't read every
letter i get, but somethin' told me to go ahead and open it, but
why would someone pray for you when they don't know you?
you didn't pray for me when i was local
and as i lay these vocals, i think of all the shit i had to go through
just to get to where i'm at, i've already told you
at least a thousand times in these rhymes
i appreciate the prayer but i've already got god on my side
and it's been one hell of a ride, hasn't it?
just watchin' it from a opposite standpoint
man, boy's got to look
nuts, and that's the only word i can think of
right now, on how to describe the shit
it's just like a vibe you get, go ahead and bop to it
just watch what you wish for, 'cause i got the shit


so be careful what you wish for, 'cause you just might get it
and if you get it, then you just might not know what to do with it
'cause it might just come back on you ten-fold
i said, "be careful what you wish for, 'cause you just might get it
and if you get it, then you just might not know what to do with it
'cause it might just come back on you ten-fold"

oh! ladies and gentlemen
the moment you've all been waiting for
in this corner, weighing 175 pounds
with a record of 17 rapes, 400 assaults, and 4 murders
the undisputed, most diabolical villain in the world
slim shady! (let's go!)

back with andre the giant, mr. elephant tusk
fix your musk, you'll be just another one bit the dust
just one of my mother's sons who got thrown under the bus
kiss my butt, lick fromunda cheese from under my nuts
it disgusts me to see the game the way that it looks
it's a must, i redeem my name and haters get mushed
bitches lust, man, they love me when i lay in the cut
fisticuffs, the lady give her eighty-some paper cuts
now picture us; it's ridiculous, you curse at the thought
'cause when i spit the verse the shit gets worse than worcestershire sauce
if i could fit the words, it's picture perfect, works every time
every verse, every line, as simple as nursery rhymes
it's elementary, the elephants have entered the room
i venture to say we're the center of attention, it's true
not to mention back with a vengeance, so hence the signal
of the bat symbol, the platinum trio's back on you hoes


so crack a bottle, let your body waddle

as i fall deeper into a manic state
i'm a prime candidate for the gene
to receive the drug addict trait
blood pressure climbs at a dramatic rate
i seem to gravitate to the bottle of nyquil then i salivate
start off with the nyquil, like, "i think i'll just have a taste"
couple of sips of that then i gradually graduate
to a harder prescription drug called valium
like, "yeah, that's great"
i go to just take one and i end up like having eight
now i need something in my stomach 'cause i haven't ate
maybe i'll grab a plate of nachos and i'll have a steak
and you'd think that with all i have at stake
look at my daughter's face
"mommy, something is wrong with dad i think
he's acting weird again, he's really beginning to scare me
won't shave his beard again and he pretends he doesn't hear me
and all he does is eat doritos and cheetos
and he just fell asleep in his car eating 3 musketeers in the rear seat, weird"


sometimes i feel so alone, i just don't know
feels like i been down this road before
so lonely and cold, it's like something takes over me
as soon as i go home and close the door
kinda feels like déjà vu
i wanna get away from this place, i do
but i can't and i won't, say i try, but i know that's a lie
'cause i don't and why, i just don't know


"maybe just a nice cold brew, what's a beer?"
that's the devil in my ear, i've been sober a fuckin' year
and that fucker still talks to me, he's all i can fucking hear
"marshall, come on, we'll watch the game
it's the cowboys and buccaneers"
"and maybe if i just drink half
i'll be half-buzzed for half of the time"
who's the mastermind behind that little line?
with that kind of rationale, man, i got half a mind
to have another half a glass of wine
sounds asinine, yeah, i know
but i never had no problem with alcohol
ouch, look out for the wall, aim for the couch, i'm 'bout to fall
i miss the couch and down i go, lookin' like a bouncy ball
shit must've knocked me out 'cause i ain't feel the ground at all
wow, what the fuck happened last night? where am i?
man, fuck, am i hungover, and goddamn, i got a headache
shit, half a vicodin, why can't i?
all systems ready for take off, please stand by


sometimes i feel so alone, i just don't know
feels like i been down this road before
so lonely and cold, it's like something takes over me
as soon as i go home and close the door
kinda feels like déjà vu
i wanna get away from this place, i do
but i can't and i won't, say i try, but i know that's a lie
'cause i don't and why, i just don't know


so i take a vicodin, splash, it hits my stomach, then (ahhh!)
couple of weeks go by, it ain't even like i'm gettin' high
now i need it just not to feel sick, yeah, i'm gettin' by
wouldn't even be taking this shit if deshaun didn't die
oh yeah, there's an excuse; you lose proof, so you use
there's new rules, it's cool if it's helpin' you to get through
it's twelve-noon, ain't no harm in self-inducin' a snooze
what else is new? fuck it, what would elvis do in your shoes?
now here i am three months later, full-blown relapse
"just get high until the kids get home from school, homes, relax"
and since i'm convinced that i'm an insomniac
i need these pills to be able to sleep, so i take three naps
just to be able to function throughout the day, let's see
that's an ambien each nap, how many valium? three?
and that will average out to about one good hour's sleep
okay, so now ya see the reason how come he
has taken four years to just put out an album, b
see, me and you, we almost had the same outcome, heath
'cause that christmas, you know the whole pneumonia thing?
it was bologna, was it the methadone, ya think?
or the hydrocodone you hide inside your pornos?
your vcr tape cases, with your ambien cr
great places to hide 'em, ain't it? so you can lie to hailie
i'm going beddy-bye, whitney, baby; good night, alaina!
go in the room and shut the bedroom door
and wake up in an ambulance
they said they found me on the bathroom floor, damn


sometimes i feel so alone, i just don't know
feels like i been down this road before
so lonely and cold, it's like something takes over me
as soon as i go home and close the door
kinda feels like déjà vu
i wanna get away from this place, i do
but i can't and i won't, say i try, but i know that's a lie
'cause i don't and why, i just don't know

yeah, boy
dem better ring the alarm, boy
dem know what's comin', boy
buck! buck! buck! haha
yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

there once was a saying that i used to say
back in the day, when i met dre
i used to sit and goof on the phone with my friend proof
that if i went gold, i'd go right through the roof
he'd say, "what if you went platinum?", i'd just laugh at him
"that's not happening, that i can't fathom"
eighty-some million records worldwide later
i'm living in a house with a fucking elevator


haters getting mad, they done had enough of shady

rappers try to play me, they use hailie as a ukulele
whoopsa-that-a-fucking-daisy
that's a no-no, even she knows da-da's fucking crazy
fucking animal, cuckoo, bananas, fucking-a, b
maybe it's because i never had a mother raise me
fuck around and throw a baby at another baby
you may think it's 'cause of the way that i was brought up
but it's all caught up to me now, karma's in the waters
every line i ever said has got me in a corner

someone shut that fucking baby up 'fore i shake it
you're standing adjacent to jason, slash, leatherface, and
together makes 'em a fucking bad combination
i lashed at the doctor in my last operation
shoved the wiener schnitzel up his ass, hopped away, some-
-body please stop the patient, get the cops to mace him
homie, i'm the scheisse, ask doctor dreson

and you're tryna find out why now there's beef
mace in your face, bitch, cry now, pussy

so you can suck my dick with amy winehouse's teeth
then i shove 'em in the elevator, take 'em to the top
stand above 'em just to cut the fucking cable, let 'em drop
walk an hour to the damn refrigerator, get a pop
while i let 'em fall all the way to the basement, yelling "stop!"

i wasn't born mean, i was pushed to treachery
i walk the streets, lookin' for some puss to fetch me
i'm like a veggie, brain is turned to mush, i'm edgy
edgy enough to give reggie bush a wedgie
if he don't gimme kim, things could get messy
so pass that ass to me, let me squish the left cheek
and press against the right one 'til it's smushed against me
and leave a dead body in the woods, the emcee
with the christopher reeves beef, we started off on the wrong foot
or should i say fake leg made outta wood?
i shouldn't, yes, i should
ridin' through the hood, i'm chillin' with westwood
i'm quite mellow, a white fellow
my pee is bright yellow, i like jell-o
i'm like, "hello," to a cute little dyke on the mic
i'm kinda like iron mike 'cause i bite earlobes


yeah
well, i must must say (yeah?)
well, um, i'm just not gay
well, um, i must must say
um, well, look- (mr. porter, son)


yeah, aight
me and westwood, blastin' off, jackin' off
in a pair of acid-washed, bumpin' asher roth
cruisin' gratiot 'til i damn near crashed the car
i'm tryna smash 'em off in the dash, hit the overpass, went off (woo!)
over the bridge, into oncoming traffic, caused
a massive forty-two car pile-up, not a scratch at all (woo!)
hopped up holdin' an axe and saw
jason mask is off when my face is plastered in tabasco sauce
spittin' flames, kickin' fire out your ass, you little bastard
you can pass it on, i'm battery acid, dawg
you don't wanna get my ass ticked off
i'm harder than playin' basketball while i'm goin' through crack withdrawal (woo!)
dick so big it's like elastic
i tie it in a knot and it looks like mr. fantastic crossed
the path of plastic man with a drastic force
and went spastic, put my penis on classic sports (look)


i shoot straight off the hip, trey-eight off the rip
but see, i ain't fo' that shit
i got a fist print fo' yo' lip
lookin' shit is swole up like the stomach on a fat pregnant bitch
and it's evident that i get chips like the president
been a lotta rules, keep the tools for the haters left
niggas ain't fadin' 'em, seal a crack, do a trim
got a lot of dough, but you know i ain't trickin' on 'em
get some head spinnin' on 'em, keep the head spinnin' on 'em
see, i ain't diggin' on 'em, keep the head hidden from 'em
you know how it go, no dough trickin' on 'em
she just wanna blow, see what she can get from 'em
but she don't know my name, i'm 'bout the game, i'm pickin' on her
wrist so cold that my left hand's numb as summer
i rip a hole 'til she don't want you gettin' on her
she makes you wonder if the women even want ya
mr. porter, keep a ho in order

once again, it's the sinister, cynical, minister shady
kryptonite to superman, he's a dentist to amy
administer of the pain, just finished huffin' the paint
and muffled the fumes like it was nothin', because it ain't
anything in his way, his enemies he just slays
his venom he spray reaches like beams of energy rays
menacin' stares, he glares, makin' the hairs
all on the back of yo' neck stand like dracula, yep
spectacular rep, he's a tarantula, gargantuan
yeah, angela, so i command you to start dancin'
part manson, part hannibal, part mechanical shark
throwin' animal parts at scarlett johansson
enter my gas chamber, you're gangsta my ass
he's got his fangs to your neck, he's set to strangle ya ass, hater
you're facin' a task greater, he's chasin' your ass
he's got his face in a mask, your bloodstains on his glass table


bitch!
yeah, yeah, yeah
aight


i'm checking the exposure of photos of me exposing
myself locked inside of a cozy hotel, posing
with or without clothing, next to the decomposing
bodies eroding while i'm dozing off, overdosing
windows opening, shutting, doors opening, closing
i think there's a ghost, too much hydrocodone and codeine
i was only s'posed to swallow a half, i took the whole thing
i'm not joking, i think i just snorted my nose ring
i need a drink, i'm standin' over the sink, posing
myself, self-loathing, 'cause i'm on a brink, mostly
i don't wanna think, "this will make everything rosy"
beverly sings, scream while i'm severing three toe-sies
totally frozen while i close in, i'm yodeling
"rosey, won't you come out to play?" ain’t no sense
wasting time, cutting and pasting headlines in the papers
making shrines of my crimes and capers
my words are whirlwinds, i murder my girlfriends
go to europe and put neurofens in my syrup and stir them
you never heard him like this, so don't encourage him
the neurosurgeon, coke mirrors, and lyrics worse than
the kinda person to get katie couric to cursin'
eighty spirits of ladies 'cause shady murdered the virgins
crazy turn of events, and then he emerged, took
over the world and reeled in all the children
lured 'em into the buildin' and killed 'em
buried 'em in the mulch and mildew and he will do what he feels, and
still can spin straw into gold like rumpelstiltskin
cotton to silk, motrin to tylenol— three pills, the real slim
shady's entered the buildin'
there's nothin' but crumbled leaves and tumbleweeds up in this bitch, mildrid
he's ill wit' it, he still shouldn't be healed
there's no one as sick as he, emcees'll get fricasseed on the grill then


fuck that! aha
right now
ahahahaha
building's on fire
fuck you, em!

-ppeared, i was hidin' in freeway's beard, just a
hop, skip and i jump from my skin gushin'
nails into my face that i've been pushin'
hellraiser, my face is my pin cushion
it's like when i'm on the mic, i can squish a
sucker like a vise grip, my pen put ya
in the slaughterhouse, 'cause your style's been butchered
i'll spin chainsaw, take off, like the blades on
my brain's on hyperdrive, someone put the brakes on

hahahahaha
ayo
just so everybody knows, that was a hook
that we made on the way to the radio station
and we were tryin' to get it right
so we may have fucked it up a couple times or whatever, but
this is what we were tryin' to, like, work out before we came here
especially for westwood, man! 'specially for you, homie!
damn, eminem! thanks for listening, baby

i want you to understand something
that when i come up in this bitch, i want the fans jumping
i want the fists pumping in the air, i don't look like a millionaire
but i feel like a million bucks, ladies won't ya fill your cups?
shady's come to feel ya up, are you a d or a c cup?
you could even be a b, it's just me and d.r.e
you'll be in the er, we are strapped with so much tnt
we may blow, no, not even cpr from the emts
could help you to resuscitate, you, busters, must be flustered, wait
you can't cut the mustard
what's your problem, can't you bust a grape?
(chkk-chk-chk) what's my name?
shady came and just crushed the game
it's really not even fair to them
'cause they pale in comparison
so much they might as well wear his skin
don't you wish you could just share his pen?
'cause this shit's getting embarrassin'
the fog is thick and the air is thin
'cause he won't even let them try to breathe
la-dididi-dadada-didi
he makes it look so easy, girl, you just hit the lottery


now this'll be the part of the song that they drop the needle on
and hell breaks loose (hoo!)
try to restrain us, you can't contain us
we're still gonna make a statement no matter what we do (yeah!)
everywhere we go it seems, we're looking for any excuse
to just cut loose (come on!)
so this'll be the part of the song that they drop the needle on
and hell breaks loose (hoo!)


this is when shit hits the fan like it just splattered on stan
this is the only moment that matters, your homie rolled in with mathers
now chaos erupts, em's in back, dre's in the front
so do what we say at once, this song’s like a seance, it haunts
it makes them stay in a trance, no choice, they have to dance
it's like the playoffs, just making sure that we stay in the hunt
take a day off of what? man, you better lay off the blunts
you must be smoking something, you think i ain't smoking nothing, stay off my nuts
now hit the floor, baby, time to wipe away all the rust
shake all them cobwebs loose
loosen up with a little bit of grey goose
yeah, girl, shake that caboose
i don't wanna see you try to make no excuse
d.r.e is on the loose
a mongoose when it comes to the chronic use
you know, i can't stand to lose
me and my goons are like animals
we come through like a pack of wolves
and we came here to retract the roof
yeah, man, ain't that the truth?
girl, your man's back in the booth
definitely back up in this bitch
and this is when all hell breaks loose


now this'll be the part of the song that they drop the needle on
and hell breaks loose (yeah!)
try to restrain us, you can't contain us
we're still gonna make a statement no matter what we do (oh!)
everywhere we go it seems, we're looking for any excuse
to just cut loose (come on!)
so this'll be the part of the song that they drop the needle on
and hell breaks loose (hoo!)


now, i know you're feeling discouraged, but, homie, just mark my words
i'm murderin' the flow, liquid courage, i'm finna blow
as soon as we hit the door, power surges head to toe
i'm sure to push it as far as words are meant to go
we're in the indigo winnebago with tinted windows
ferocious as we proceed to beat up the block wit' your ho
with speakers knocking, it's three-o'clock, me and doc then proceed to drop
e and hop out the vehicle and knock on your door


now this'll be the part of the song that they drop the needle on
and hell breaks loose (hoo!)
try to restrain us, you can't contain us
we're still gonna make a statement no matter what we do (yeah!)
everywhere we go it seems, we're looking for any excuse
to just cut loose (come on!)
so this'll be the part of the song that they drop the needle on
and hell breaks loose (hoo!)

you see that chick in the gym, checking me out?
any second i'm 'bout to stick her neck in my mouth
i lose a pill and i'm recklessly wreckin' the house
that was supposed to be breakfast, where the heck is it now?
there's the necklace i lost, right next to stephanie's blouse
man, i should check to see if my mom left any out
nope, guess i'll re-route
maybe somewhere in the depths of the couch
oh, jackpot, yeah—open sesame, mouth
down the hatch, and the feeling—you can't match it
i rap-tat-tap on your door with a damn ratchet
attack-tack-tacking a whore with a damn hatchet
a knapsack packed with like forty-some xanaxes
shorty, come back, i'm tryna score me some lapdances
i'm 'bout to relapse, so, baby, pour me some jack daniel's
formula 44d and 40s with bad capsules
the bad apple spoils the bunch, i'm back at ya


girl, i don't mean any harm
all i wanted to do is just say hello
and are you menstruating, baby?
my little friend's waiting to say hello
the way your titties are wigglin'
and your booty's shakin' like jello
girl, i don't mean any harm
all i wanted to do is just say hello, yeah


my equilibrium's off—must be the lithium
i don't need to buy any drugs, man—people give me 'em
it just becomes everyday, extra-curriculum
no reason in particular—it was strictly fun
a fifth of rum and two bottles of 151
fifty-one people asleep in my damn living room
excuse me, hun, but what is your name? vivian?
i woke up next to you naked, and, uh, did we, um?
of course, we did, but didn't i strap jimmy, hun?
i'm looking for the torn wrapper, but there don't seem to be one
no offense, baby girl, i don't mean any harm
but disease is something i'm trying to keep my penis free from
i find the package, and i'm cool—i immediately run
like speedy gon-zales to see if i see anyone
who might have a couple of 3's—i'm fiending for some
my head is pounding to the beat of the drum


girl, i don't mean any harm
all i wanted to do is just say hello
and do you happen to have anything on you
to make my mood mellow?
some are oval and some are pink
some are blue and some are just yellow
girl, i don't mean any harm
all i wanted to do is just say hello


oh, those were the days, they certainly were
it's hurting me to know that i'll be closing that curtain for good
word-word, chk-word-word, chk-word, chk-chk-word
i second that and i third, rushed to emergency surgery
to try to flush me because of the drugs that he purchased
he's no longer getting them free—hundred bucks for these percodans
plus, it's getting to be where he'll lustfully search the den
pain is hitting his knee and his muscles be hurtin' him
tirelessly on the phone trying to rustle up
muscle relaxers for his back and a couple of paxils
now he's doubling backwards, and he's stumbling back
slipped and fell, hit his back, boom, heard something go crack
now he's up in the bathroom like he's busting a nap
almost ended it that soon because of the fact
i'm just busting my own chops while i'm busting a rap
resuscitated and rejuved, so fuck it, i'm back


girl, i don't mean any harm
all i wanted to do is just say hello
and do you happen to have anything on you
to make my mood mellow?
some are oval and some are pink
some are blue and some are just yellow
girl, i don't mean any harm
all i wanted to do is just say hello


yeah, it's like starting over
clean slate
ha

i was born with a dick in my brain, yeah, fucked in the head
my stepfather said that i sucked in the bed
'til one night, he snuck in and said, "we're going out back, i want my dick sucked in the shed"
can't we just play with teddy ruxpin instead?
"after i fuck you in the butt, get some head
bust a nut, get some rest," the next day my mother said
"i don't know what the fuck's up with this kid!
the bastard won't even eat nothing, he's fed
he just hung himself in the bedroom, he's dead!"
"debbie, don't let that fucker get you upset
go in there, stick a fuckin' cigarette to his neck
i'll bet you he's fakin' it, i'll bet you, i bet he probably
just wants to see how upset you would get
i'll go handle this, of course, unless you object?"
"aw, go fuck his brains out if any's left in his head!"


if you could count the skeletons in my closet
under my bed and up under my faucet
then you would know i've completely lost it
is he nuts? no, he's insane!
if you could count the skeletons in my closet
under my bed and up under my faucet
then you would know i've completely lost it
is he nuts? no, he's insane!


"did you get him?" — "nah, fucker tried to bite my face off
i just got fuckin' chased off with a chainsaw
then he took the chainsaw, bit the fuckin' blades off
ate the blades, stuck a baseball in a slingshot
then he aimed at his own face, let the thing pop
took his eye out, picked it up and played ping pong
then he played ping pong with his own ding-dong
that motherfucker's got nuts like king kong
then he set the lawnmower out on the dang lawn
and he laid all up underneath it with the thing on
then he took his pants, he took every fuckin' thing off
everything 'cept his tank top and his training bra
ain't he raw?" yeah, maniac, that's shady, dawg
man, that motherfucker's gangsta, ain't he dawg?
shady, dawg, what be goin' through that fuckin' brain of yours?
say no more, what the fuck you waitin' for? sing along!


if you could count the skeletons in my closet
under my bed and up under my faucet
then you would know i've completely lost it
is he nuts? no, he's insane!
if you could count the skeletons in my closet
under my bed and up under my faucet
then you would know i've completely lost it
is he nuts? no, he's insane!


don't you know what felch means? ("yeah") well then, tell me
would you rather get felched or do the felching?
fuck 'em in the ass, suck the cum out while you're belching (urrp!)
burp, belch, and go back for a second helping
can you dig what i'm saying, man? can you smell me?
i want you to feel me like my stepfather felt me (oh...)
fuck a little puppy, kick the puppy while he's yelping
"shady, what the fuck you saying?" — i don't know, help me!
what the fuck's happening? i think i'm fuckin' melting
"marshall, i just love you, boy, i care about your well-being"
no, dad, i said no! — i don't need no help peeing
i'm a big boy, i can do it by myself, see?
i only get naked when the babysitter tells me
she showed me a movie like nightmare on elm street
but it was x and they called it "pubic hair on chelsea"
"well, this is called 'ass rape', and we're shooting the jail scene"


if you could count the skeletons in my closet
under my bed and up under my faucet
then you would know i've completely lost it
is he nuts? no, he's insane
if you could count the skeletons in my closet
under my bed and up under my faucet
then you would know i've completely lost it
is he nuts? no, he's insane

oh my goodness, what have i done?
oh no, i can't believe it
it's like i've got the whole world in my palm
and i'm ready to drop bombs


welcome to the slim shady mecca, rebecca
it's the village in new york, right next to the tribeca
that's my sector, homosexual dissector
come again, rewind selector
i said, "nice rectum," i had a vi-sectomy hector
so you can't get pregnant if i bisexually wreck ya
hannibal lecter into guy sex and i bet ya
i tantalize ya and in less than five seconds i get ya
they say once bitten then twice shy, well i'm next to the guy
with nine ecstasy pills and five extra
boxes of ribbed condoms in quantities, why yes sir
i took the rest of the lunesta pills from my dresser
that's my kind of vibe, what else should i try, lester?
drop-kick the bitch before her second trimester
perform the home abortion with dexter, then i guess i'll
dig her fetus out with a wire hanger, then digest her


i guess it's time for you to hate me again
let's begin, now hand me the pen
how should i begin it and where does it all end?
the world is just my medicine ball, you're all in
i said, i guess it's time for you to hate me again
let's begin, now hand me the pen
how should i begin it and where does it all end?
my medicine ball, you're in my medicine ball, friends


all my westside bitches throw it up
put a balloon inside your pussy, queef, and blow it up
man, i think that he just fell off the deep end, showin' up
so you better change the station to keep from throwing up
man, you seen it all before, you're all too familiar with it
there's a penis on the floor and two balls, so you know who did it
you know you with it, girl, don't front, oh no, you didn't
i won't rape all the pussycat dolls? nicole, you kiddin'?
i'll pee on rihanna, see man, i do what i wanna
spray perfume in the sauna room, crazy-gluin' madonna
to the la-z-boy sofa, fold her in two, then sit on her
imagine the visual for that, man, who would've thought i
could ever be such a relentless prick, unleashing his vengeance
but the chick's so old, she looks like she outlived a life sentence
i never meant this rhyme to be so offensive
if you weren't so defensive, it wouldn't be, you're so sensitive


i guess it's time for you to hate me again
let's begin, now hand me the pen
how should i begin it and where does it all end?
the world is just my medicine ball, you're all in
i said, i guess it's time for you to hate me again
let's begin, now hand me the pen
how should i begin it and where does it all end?
my medicine ball, you're in my medicine ball, friends


put christopher reeves on a unicycle with a kickstand
kick it up and push him and lead him right into quicksand
here, you need a hand, big man? grab hold of this branch
with both hands, man, they don't understand, i'm just a sick man
now everybody's pissed at me
like it's my fault his name rhymes with so many different words, jeez
so one last time, mr. christopher reeves
won't you break it down for me and just spit the verse, please?
"eminem, i'm coming to kill you *inhale*
always hated you, and i still do
you'll never fill my shoes, my superman costume *inhale*
doesn't even fit you, they don't feel you
you're taking this shit too far *inhale*
who do you think you are? hang my suit up in the armoire
every day i hate you more and more, throw down the cardboard
let's breakdance if you think you're hardcore"


i guess it's time for you to hate me again
let's begin, now hand me the pen

my medicine ball, you're in my medicine ball, friends (medicine ball, friends)


the world is mine

once again, it's the sinister cynical minister shady
kryptonite to superman, he's a dentist to amy
administerer of the pain, he just finished huffin' the paint
and muffler fumes like it was nothin', because it ain't
anything in his way, his enemies he just slays
his venom he sprays, reaches like beams of energy rays
menacing stares, he glares, making the hairs
all on the back of ya neck stand like dracula, yep
spectacular rep, he's a tarantula, gargantuan
yeah, angela, so i command ya to start dancin'
part manson, part hannibal, part mechanical shark
throwing animal parts at scarlett johansson
enter my gas chamber, you gangsta? my ass
he's got his fangs to your neck, he's set to strangle ya ass, hater
you're facin' a task greater, he's chasin' your ass
he's got his face in a mask, your blood stains on his glass table


i'm checking the exposure of photos of me exposing
myself locked inside of a cozy hotel posing
with or without clothing, next to the decomposing
bodies eroding while i'm dozing off, overdosing
windows opening, shutting; doors opening, closing
i think there's a ghost, too much hydrocodone and codeine
i was only 'sposed to swallow a half, i took the whole thing
i'm not joking, i think i just snorted my nose ring
i need a drink, i'm standing over the sink hosing
myself, self-loathing, cause i'm on a brink, mostly
i don't wanna think; this will make everything rosy
beverly sings, scream while i'm severing three toesies
totally frozen while i close in
i'm yodelling "rosie, won't you come out to play?"
and no sense wasting time, cutting and pasting headlines
in the papers, making shrines of my crimes and capers
my words are whirlwinds, i murder my girlfriends
go to europe and put nurofens in my syrup and stirred 'em
you never heard 'em like this, so don't encourage him
the neurosurgeon, coke mirrors, and lyrics worse than
the kinda person to get katie couric to cursin'
eighty spirits of ladies cause shady murdered the virgins
crazy turn of events  that he emerged
took over the world and reeled in all the children
lured 'em into the building and killed 'em
buried 'em in the mulch and mildew and he will do what he feels
and still can spin, straw to gold like rumplestilskin
cotton to silk, motrin to tylenol 3 pills
the real slim shady's entered the buildin'
there's nothing but crumbled leaves and tumbleweeds up in this bitch
mildred, he's ill with it, he still shouldn't be healed
there's no one as sick as he, mc's will get fricassed on the grill, then

yeah
yeah, girl
can you hear that? it's playing our song
are you sleepy? take a nap
you're not afraid of the dark, are you?


you hear the beat as it makes ya not want to go to sleep
i knock on dakota's door; it's locked, so i go to creep
'round the back with binoculars, not 'cause i wanna peep
but because i'm hungry, she smells like tacos, i wanna eat
visions of hot chocolaty marshmallows, all so sweet
with sugar plums; oh, look
here comes marshall, he's on your street
he's placing hot, smoldering charcoals beneath your feet
now walk on 'em; he's dancing with carcasses cheek to cheek
like a thanksgiving turkey, a holiday ham
cinnamon sprinkled on toast, strawberry marmalade jam
flavor my favorite graham crackers with jonbenét rams'
i guess a modern-day jack the ripper is all that i am


(my music box)
'cause when the lights are off, i see the girl's asleep
(my music box)
but i can hear you, my love, you keep calling me
(my music box)
although we're worlds apart, you mean the world to me
(my music box, my music box)
so once you call, i come, i will answer
(my music box)
'cause when the lights are off, i see the girl's asleep
(my music box)
i hear my music box playing a song for me
(my music box)
so won't you twirl around and do a whirl for me?
(my music box, my music box)
and would you be my private little dancer?


i almost look comatose; who wants to be sober? gross
i foam like a doberman, mouth open, i overdose
put coke up my nostrils in both my holes, then i plug my nose
my pupils quadruple in size, eyes are so bugged, i know
i put on my mother's makeup, get naked and run around
wavin' the gun around, i think i'm down to a hundred pounds
there's thunder, i wonder how come it rains, but the sun is out?
the devil's upset with his wife, they must be sluggin' it out
i must be buggin' the fuck out, but what the fuck about?
voices are leading me up to the attic, i love my house
they pull and they tug my blouse, the sound of a music box
comes from inside a toy chest, but what do i do? it's locked
i pick it and open it, but it's stuffed full of human parts
i dig 'til i find it, i wind it up, and the tune just starts
it's playing a song, so beautiful, and the room is dark
the moon is full, i smell a funeral, guess i'll loom in the park


(my music box)
'cause when the lights are off, i see the girl's asleep
(my music box)
but i can hear you, my love, you keep calling me
(my music box)
although we're worlds apart, you mean the world to me
(my music box, my music box)
so once you call, i come, i will answer
(my music box)
'cause when the lights are off, i see the girl's asleep
(my music box)
i hear my music box playing a song for me
(my music box)
so won't you twirl around and do a whirl for me?
(my music box, my music box)
and would you be my private little dancer?


i'm fixated on asphyxiatin' and breakin'
this little chick's neck like a pixy stick
the sick, satan-worshippin' bitches get horse whippings
i'm in the back, through the back door slippin'
through the crack, leavin' the corpse drippin'
the mortician of love, sent from above
forced entry, the more wenchy the more stingy i become
been doing this for more than a quarter-century, i'm just numb
am i dreaming, is it real? someone pinch me on the buns
the time has come to tie her up, gotta roll me the ladder
i've had enough of the chatter
climb up to the window, look at her
then climb in slow to shatter her brain matter and batter her
with a bat; a matter of fact, that will splatter her
but before i do that, i'll have a chat to flatter her
give her two compliments back to back, like "tabitha
i'm your secret admirer, i'm back to ravish ya
so strong is your fight, but you're no match for dracula"
prolonging her plight as i go back to stabbin' her
dismember her limbs, simple as that: cadaver her
zoom in with the lens, then pan back the camera
stand back, 'cause here comes your man jack, so pamela


(my music box)
'cause when the lights are off, i see the girl's asleep
(my music box)
but i can hear you, my love, you keep calling me
(my music box)
although we're worlds apart, you mean the world to me
(my music box, my music box)
so once you call, i come, i will answer
(my music box)
'cause when the lights are off, i see the girl's asleep
(my music box)
i hear my music box playing a song for me
(my music box)
so won't you twirl around and do a whirl for me?
(my music box, my music box)
and would you be my private little dancer?

yeah, ohh, yeah yeah, ohh
i feel like dancing, i feel like dancing
i smell something in the air that's making me (high)
i said, i smell something in the air that's making me high


okay, here we go, do-re-mi-fa-so, fa-so-la-ti-da-so
lyrical roscoe, kick back the tabasco
you motherfuckers must just not know the tick-tock, so
time to show you the most kick-ass flow in the cosmos
picasso with a pick-axe, a sick asshole
tic-tac-toe 'cross your six-pack with x-acto
knives, stranglin' wives with thick lasso
big bags of the grass, zig-zags, i'm with the doc, so
you know how that go, skull and the crossbones
this is poison to boys and girls who do not know
you do not wanna try this at home, my lil' vato
this is neither the time nor the place to get macho
so crack a six-pack, sit back with some nachos
maybe some popcorn and watch the show and just rock slow
it's not what you expected, nor what you thought, so
'bout time that you wake the fuck up, smell the pot smoke


it must be the ganja, it's the marijuana
that's creeping up on me, why i'm so high
maybe it's the henny that has gotten in me
whatever's got into me, i don't mind
i said it's the ganja, it's the marijuana
that's creeping up on me, why i'm so high
maybe it's the henny that has gotten in me
whatever's got into me, i don't mind


your dreams are gettin' fulfilled, ooh, i'm literally gettin' a chill
spittin' at will, me and dre have just finished splittin' a pill
you're submittin' to skill, sittin' still
i'm admittin' i'm beginnin' to feel like i don't think anyone's real
faced with a dilemma: i can be dalai lama
and be calm or bring drama, a step beyond of jeffrey dahmer
please don't upset me, mama, you're lookin' sexy, mama
don't know if it's the lala or the rum and pepsi, mama
don't wanna end up inside my refrigerator freezer
be used as extra topping the next time i make a pizza
how many people you know who can name every serial
killer who ever existed in a row?
put 'em in chronological order, beginnin' with jack the ripper
name the time and place; from the body, the bag, the zipper
location of the woods, where the body was dragged and then dumped
the trunk that they were stuffed in, the model, the make, the plate
and which model, which lake they found her in, how they attacked the victim
say which murder weapon was used to do what in which one
which knife and which gun, what kid, what wife, and which nun
don't stop, i like this, it's fun, the fuckin' night's just begun


it must be the ganja, it's the marijuana
that's creeping up on me, why i'm so high
maybe it's the henny that has gotten in me
whatever's got into me, i don't mind
i said it's the ganja, it's the marijuana
that's creeping up on me, why i'm so high
maybe it's the hindi that has gotten in me
whatever's got into me, i don't mind


when i'm behind the mic, dynamite's what it's kinda like
you're stuck with the same stick that you're tryna light
behind the board sits dre, legends are made this way
isn't it safe to say this is the way it should be?
maybe you need some lyric syrup serum for your symptoms
here's a dosage of the antidote, now you give him some
he can give her some, she can give them some
get behind a linndrum, make up a beat and cure the sucker syndrome
the spinnin' drum when it comes to lyrics and pennin' some
startin' from scratch and then endin' up at the ending of
capable of winnin' a pulitzer
so unbelievable, it's a titanium cranium that's full of sur–
–prises when the smoke rises right before your very own eyes
you stare into your stereos (high)
good evening, this isn't even a weed thing
i ain't even smoke anything, i ain't even drinking


it must be the ganja, it's the marijuana
that's creeping up on me, why i'm so high
maybe it's the henny that has gotten in me
whatever's got into me, i don't mind
it must be the ganja, it's the marijuana
that's creeping up on me, why i'm so high
maybe it's the hindi that has gotten in me
whatever's got into me, i don't mind

yeah, look


if i were to rap about the crap that's out
that's the route you probably want me to take
‘cause you're just dyin' to know what i think
and my take on some other rappers
if i was to say somethin' about paul wall
you'd probably crap in your pants, ‘cause i'm white and he's white
so he's like my competition, i mean, right?
nope! paul wall is dope, and so is bubba
so bu-bu-bu-bu-bu-bu-bu-bu-but, i don't compete with nobody
i just go hard, do the rope-a-dope ali shuffle
and dance around my opponents, do donuts
sometimes i play possum, like i'm asleep, it's awesome
i'm like a sleepin' giant, and when i awake i'm like dre
i just jump from outta nowhere and bite prey
and sink my teeth in 'em, and fill 'em
full of poison, and make a noise like a snake before i kill 'em
and let 'em know that i just don't feel 'em
and smack 'em with the backward e, the eminem emblem
i was taught if you gonna murder somebody you should face him
tell him why, look him dead in the eye, then waste him
and the dark shall emerge from the fiery depths of hell
then swallow the shell, all the hollow who dwell
in the shadows of all who are willing to sell their souls
for this rap game and it g-g-goes
one-two-three, chk-chk, one-two-three
chk-chk, one-two-three, that ain't the hook, now follow me
there's nothing else for me to say, my public adores me
everybody bores me, they're just so corny
so at night before i sleep, i look in the mirror
the mirror grows lips and it whispers: "come nearer!"


my darling, i don't ever want you to leave me, my darling
you and me were meant to be together, my darling

"shady, listen! (shady!) you hear that?
they're screaming for you, i can bring your career back!"
but i don't want it back — "yes, you do," — no, i don't
"yes, you do! you're gonna regret it later," — no, i won't
"i'ma get dre on the phone, i'll just call the doctor"
go ahead, i already talked to dre yesterday
"well, i got him on the phone right now!"
(slim!) you're lying! (yo, slim!) how, why now?
what up, dre? (check this out, slim, i gotta talk to you
i don't know, it just seems like ever since you got off your
drugs you became a lot softer)
but dre, all shady is, is a bottle of hair bleach and vodka
(well, just think about it, slim, i'm here
just hit me back and let me know what's up) — fuck this mirror!
"i'm not in the mirror, i'm inside you
let me guide you," — fuck you! die, you son of a bitch!
"put the gun down!" — bye-bye! boom!
okay, i'm still alive, — "so am i too!
you can't kill a spirit even if you tried to
ha-ha, you sold your soul to me, need i remind you?
you remember that night you prayed to god
you'd give anything to get a record deal? well, dre signed you
this is what you wanted your whole life, marshall, right? ooh
look at this house, look at these cars: they're so nice, woo!
oh, but you didn't know fame has a price too?
that you just now seeing the downside to
lose your best friend from high school, your wife too
ain't even sure if your kids like you
come off tour, can't even sleep at night without nyquil
become a valium addict, start a rehab cycle
but together we can break the cycle
marshall…" — what?! — "no one's gonna love you like i do"
*chainsaw starting up*

‘cause i possess your soul, your mind, your heart and your body (your body, your body, your body, your body)

yeah

okay!
alright, a'ight, a'ight, a'ight, a'ight (yo, yo)
yo, yo
alright, i'ma lay the chorus first
here we go now!


my mom loved valium and lots of drugs
that's why i am like i am 'cause i'm like her
because my mom loved valium and lots of drugs
that's why i'm on what i'm on 'cause i'm my mom!


“my mom, my mom”, i know you're probably tired
of hearin' 'bout my mom, oh-ho, whoa-ho
but this is just a story of when i was just a shorty
and how i became hooked on va-aliu-um
valium was in everything, food that i ate
the water that i drank, fuckin' peas in my plate
she sprinkled just enough of it to season my steak
so every day i'd have at least three stomachaches
now tell me, what kind of mother would want to see her
son grow up to be an undera-fuckin'-chiever?
my teacher didn't think i was gonna be nothin' either
"what the fuck you stickin' gum up under the fuckin' seat for?"
"mrs. mathers, your son has been huffin' ether
either that or the motherfucker's been puffin' reefer"
but all this huffin' and puffin' wasn't what it was either
it was neither, i was buzzin' but it wasn't what she thought
pee in a teacup? bitch, you ain't my keeper, i'm sleepin'
what the fuck you keep on fuckin' with me for?
slut, you need to leave me the fuck alone, i ain't playin'
go find you a white crayon and color a fuckin' zebra!


my mom loved valium and lots of drugs
that's why i am like i am 'cause i'm like her
because my mom loved valium and lots of drugs
that's why i'm on what i'm on 'cause i'm my mom!


wait a minute, this ain't dinner, this is paint thinner!
"you ate it yesterday, i ain't hear no complaints, did i?
now here's a plate full of painkillers, now just wait
'til i crush the valium and put it in your potatoes
you little motherfucker, i'll make you sit there and make
that retarded fuckin' face without even tastin' it
you better lick the fuckin' plate, you ain't wastin' it
put your face in it 'fore i throw you in the basement again
and i ain't givin' in, you're gonna just sit there
in one fuckin' place, finnickin' 'til next thanksgiving
and if you still ain't finished it, i'll use the same shit again
then when i make spinach dip, it'll be placed in the shit
you little shit, wanna sit there and play innocent?
a rack fell and hit me in k-mart and they witnessed it
child support, your father, he ain't sent the shit
and so what if he did? it's none of your dang business, kid!"


my mom
there's no one else quite like my mom
i know i should let bygones be bygones
but she's the reason why i am high on what i'm high on, 'cause—


my mom loved valium and lots of drugs
that's why i am like i am 'cause i'm like her
because my mom loved valium and lots of drugs
that's why i'm on what i'm on 'cause i'm my mom!


my mom loved valium, now all i am
is a party animal, i am what i am
but i'm strong to the finish with me valium spinach
but my buzz only lasts about two minutes
but i don't wanna swallow it without chewin' it
i can't even write a rhyme without you in it
my valium, my vaaaaaa-liummmm, ohh!


man, i never thought that i could ever be
a drug addict, naw, fuck that, i can't have it happen to me
but that's actually what has ended up happenin'
a tragedy, the fuckin' past ended up catchin' me
and it's probably where i got acquainted with the taste, ain't it?
pharmaceuticals are the bomb, mom, beautiful
she killed the fuckin' dog with the medicine she done fed it
feed it a fuckin' aspirin and say that it has a headache
"here, want a snack? you hungry, you fuckin' brat?
look at that, it's a xanax, take it and take a nap, eat it"
but i don't need it — "well fuck it then, break it up
take a little piece and beat it before you wake nathan up"
alright, ma, you win, i don't feel like arguin'
i'll do it, pop it, gobble it, and start wobblin'
stumble, hobble, tumble, slip, trip, then i fall in bed
with a bottle of meds and a heath ledger bobblehead


my mom loved valium and lots of drugs
that's why i am like i am 'cause i'm like her
because my mom loved valium and lots of drugs
that's why i'm on what i'm on 'cause i'm my mom!


my mom, i'm just like her
my mom, my mom, my mom
my mom, my mom, my mom
my mom, my mom, my mom
my mom, my momma
me momma, i like-a da momma
haha, sorry mom
i still love you though!
dr. dre, 2010
hey, this shit is hella hard, homie
yo, take us on outta here
woo!

good evening
this is your fucking captain speaking
we will soon be reaching an altitude of
four million and a half... feet
that's eight million miles in the sky
please, undo your seat belt for takeoff (chhk)
you are now free to smoke about the cabin (the cabin) (chhka)


speak of the devil, it's attack of the rain man
chainsaw in hand, bloodstain on my apron
soon as the blade spun, vrrunn, they run away from
who wanna play dungeon? no one is safe from
in search of a brain surgeon, a great one
wait, it ain't funny, man, it's urgent, i need one
two boxes of detergent in a paint gun
and an emergency squirt gun to spray a-1


so, one more time for old time's sake
dre, drop that beat and scratch that break
now just blow a little bit of that smoke my way
and let's go (i'm now smoking with the best)
i said, "one more time for old time's sake
dre, drop that beat and scratch that break
now just send a little bit of that smoke my way
and let's go (i'm now smoking with the best)"


smoke signal in the sky like verizon wireless
a nice environment, surprised entirely
hypnotized by the sound, i surround the hydrants
taking lives of firemen; say "goodbye", here i am again
naked wives and vicodin
before i begin to get so high, pussy boy, i could spin
vinn-vinn, fuck the handle, i fly off the hinge
let that boy off the bench, coach, and throw it to him
there he goes in his trench coat, no clothes again
baby, make us some french toast and show us some skin
i'll show you every inch grows on my foreskin
show me nipple, i pinch both, and throw up a ten
now you know it's a sin to tease, blow us again
the sorcerer of intercourse; if it's forced, it's him
don't fight the feeling if you're feeling the force within
and when you wake up in the morning next to the porcelain


so, one more time for old time's sake
dre, drop that beat and scratch that break
now just blow a little bit of that smoke my way
and let's go (i'm now smokin' with the best)
i said, "one more time for old time's sake
dre, drop that beat and scratch that break
now just send a little bit of that smoke my way
and let's go (i'm now smokin' with the best)"


nuh-uh, he ain't playin'
he's gon' get the ak and aim it right at your brain, hey
i'm slightly insane, hey, vodka and creatine
hpnotiq and red bull, it's an incredible energy drink
and it's given me wings, i believe i can fly
while i pee on a girl, you won't catch me csi
it's as easy as pie, and as simple as cake
dre, get on the mic and make 'em tremble and shake


well, smoke enough for me, fuck, yeah, light it up, cheech
come on, smoke me out cuz, give me contact buzz
get me on track, they love me when i'm on that stuff
but this is earth calling shady, man, come on back—what?
man, we're losing him, he won't even respond back, fuck!
now look at all the pretty women in here (damn, bitches!)
dre, it's hot, i think we better go check on their temperatures
i'll get the thermometer, you get the bandages
now, baby, just bend over, this won't hurt a damn bit, just—


give me one more time for old time's sake
dre, drop that beat and scratch that break
now just blow a little bit of that smoke my way
and let's go (i'm now smokin' with the best)
i said, "one more time for old time's sake
dre, drop that beat and scratch that break
now just send a little bit of that smoke my way
and let's go (i'm now smokin' with the best)"

yeah
same song and dance
damn, girl, everywhere i go
same song and dance
i like the way you move, all over the globe
same song and dance
something about it, man
same song and dance
in the pale moonlight (yo)


i'm lookin' at ya, yeah, girl, you're kinda tooken back by
the whole rapper thing, aren't ya?
probably thinking you'll get slapped so dang hard, ya
won't even be able to stand up straight, aren't ya?
couple rape charges, people think you're a monster
the police constantly bugging you non-stop
i walk up on ya, “well, hello, tonya
i think you got your onstar button inside your car stuck
you out of gas? do you got a flat?
i would hate for you to be stranded at the laundromat
i got your back
why don't you put your laundry baskets in the back
and sit up front; i'm not asking, it's a trap
you just got jacked and body snatched, and it's a wrap
in broad day, and no mask for this attack
i heard 'em say, 'exact opposites attract'
if that's a fact, it'll take task force to get you back
come on"


yeah, baby, do that dance
it's the last dance you'll ever get the chance to do
girl, shake that ass, you ain't never gonna break that glass
that windshield's too strong for you
i said, "yeah, baby, sing that song
it's the last song you'll ever get the chance to sing
you sexy little thing, show me what you got, give it your all
look at you bawl, why you crying to me?"
same song and dance


the first victim i had, she was a big one
big movie star, a party girl, big fun
she was the girl the media always picked on
in and out of rehab every four-to-six months
she was always known for little pranks and slick stunts
at nickelodeon, flashed the little kids once
what an event it was, i was sitting in front
i was hooked in at the first glimpse of them buns
seen her backstage, now here's where i come in, son
look, here she comes, i better pull out the big guns
"hello, lindsay, you're looking a little thin, hun
how 'bout a ride to rehab? get in, cunt!"
but starting off on the wrong foot is what i didn't want
"girl, i'm just kidding, let me start over again, hun
see what i meant was, we should have a little intervention
come with me to brighton, let me relieve your tension
you little wench, ya, murder wasn't my intention
if i wanted to kill you, it would've already been done"
slowly she gets in and i begin to lynch her
with 66 inches of extension cord


yeah, baby, do that dance
it's the last dance you'll ever get the chance to do
girl, shake that ass, you ain't never gonna break that glass
that windshield's too strong for you
i said, "yeah, baby, sing that song
it's the last song you'll ever get the chance to sing
you sexy little thing, show me what you got, give it your all
look at you bawl, why you crying to me?"
same song and dance


my second victim was even bigger than the first
pop star, icon, the whole works
she played a little schoolgirl when she first
burst upon the scene and seen that the world was hers
she twirls and turns and flirts in skirts so bad it hurts
it irked me, it made me mad at first
i lashed out in my songs, but what was really going on
was that i had developed a crush
i just didn't know how to tell it to her
should i cut off one of my ears and mail it to her?
send her pictures of my collection of skeletons, or
footage of me impaling myself on an elephant tusk?
we'll settle this once and for all, i'ma tell her at dusk
tonight, tonight is the night, and tell her i must
creep up to her mansion in stilettos, and just
climb the gate, and ring the bell like, "hello, my love
i just picked your prescription for seroquel up
now would you like to share a pill or two with me?
i'll share my valium with you, 'cause i'm feeling you, britney
i'll trade you a blue one for a pink one
ever since a schoolgirl juvenile delinquent
i've been feeling you, ooh-ooh, girl, you sexy little gal, you
hold that pill any longer, it'll get sentimental value
c'mon toots, give me the valium alley-oop
i'll slam dunk it in your mouth 'til you puke
and just as soon as you pass out in your alphabet soup
i'm 'bout to make a new outfit out of you
new outfit? shit, i'll make a suit out of you, shoot
now, show me how you move, baby, do how a-you do"


yeah, baby, do that dance
it's the last dance you'll ever get the chance to do
girl, shake that ass, you ain't never gonna break that glass
that windshield's too strong for you
i said, "yeah, baby, sing that song
it's the last song you'll ever get the chance to sing
you sexy little thing, show me what you got, give it your all
look at you bawl, why you crying to me?"
same song and dance


same kicking and screaming, same crying and sobbing
same song and dance
same begging and pleading, same yelling and bleeding
same song and dance
yeah
same song and dance
i know
same song and dance

yo, yo, follow me (follow me)
come with me to the dark side of the force (force)
no man would boldly go to this place
the devil only knows of this world
so dark and, oh, so cold, it's, oh, so cold
oh, so cold, oh


soon as my flow starts, i compose art like the ghost of mozart
even though they all say that they're real, i know that most aren't
boy, you think you're clever, don't ya? girl, you think you're so smart
come with me to another side in a world so cold and so dark


(stay wide awake)
a world so dark, a world so cold
a world where on-ly some will go
(stay wide awake)
but none return, when will they learn?
where do they go? god only knows
(stay wide awake)

fe-fi-fo-fum, i think i smell the scent of a placenta
i enter central park, it's dark, it's winter in december
i see my target, put my car in park, and approach a tender
young girl by the name of brenda, and i pretend to befriend her
sit down beside her like a spider, "hi, there girl, you mighta
heard of me before, see, whore, you're the kind of girl that i'd a–
-ssault and rape, then figure why not try to make your pussy wider
fuck you with an umbrella then open it up while the shit's inside ya
i'm the kind of guy that's mild but i might flip and get a little bit wilder
impregnate a lesbian, yeah, now let's see her have triplets, and i'll di–
-sintegrate them babies as soon as they're out her with formalde–
-hyde and cyanide, girl, you can try and hide, you can try to scream louder
no need for no gunpowder, that only takes all the fun out of
murderin', i'd rather go vinn-vinn, and now you see just how the
fuck i do just what i do when i cut right through your scalp, uhh
shit, wait a minute, i mean skull, my knife seems dull, pull another one out, uh"


soon as my flow starts i compose art like the ghost of mozart
even though they all say that they're real, i know that most aren't
boy, you think you're clever, don't ya? girl, you think you're so smart
come with me to another side in a world so cold and so dark


(stay wide awake)
a world so dark, a world so cold
a world where on-ly some will go
(stay wide awake)
but none return, when will they learn?
where do they go? god only knows
(stay wide awake)

so dark and so cold, my friends don't know this other side of me
there's a monster inside of me, it's quite ugly and it frightens me
but they can't see what i can see, there's a vacancy in my tummy
it's makin' me play hide-and-seek like jason, i'm so hungry
she's naked, see, no privacy, but i can see she wants me
so patient, see, i try to be, but gee, why does she taunt me?
pulls the drapes and she goes right to sleep and i creep right through the front, see
so blatantly, but silently 'cause i know that she's sound 'sleep
"who's wakin' me so violently, and why's he on top of me?
he's rapin' me," she tries to scream, "somebody please get him off me
he's tapin' me, he's bitin' me, he's laughin' like it's funny"
she's scrapin' me, she's fightin' me, she's scratchin' like some dumb freak
escapin' me, no dice, you see, i might just be ted bundy
or satan, gee, what a sight to see, i'm dancin' in my red panties
i'm crazy, but it's alright with me, man, life can be so empty
stay away from me 'cause i'm dancin' to quite a different drum beat


soon as my flow starts i compose art like the ghost of mozart
even though they all say that they're real, i know that most aren't
boy, you think you're clever, don't ya? girl, you think you're so smart
come with me to another side in a world so cold and so dark


(stay wide awake)
a world so dark, a world so cold
a world where on-ly some will go
(stay wide awake)
but none return, when will they learn?
where do they go? god only knows
(stay wide awake)

better try to stay wide awake or you might end up found dead by the lake
soon as you lay me down to sleep, bitch, your soul i'ma try to take
pray for light of day right away, why do they try to fight today?
i must make them pay twice as much, might as well put the knife away
now i use power tools, how 'bout now, are you in the shower?
scour you for six hours 'til outage of power outlets
how did you figure out i was down in your basement? now ya
must've just heard the sound of my stomach growlin' from down there
prowler, there's no one fouler, bound ya, that's how they found ya
face down in the tub, i drown ya with piles of downers around ya
such nostalgia and power, such prowess, look how you cower
jump out on you now like i was a jawa from fuckin' star wars
jabba the hutt, biddy-bye-bye, biddy-bye-bye, it's time to die-die
ought to not even bother to scream, it don't even matter
amazing when grazin' skin with these razor blades he waves at ya
not ya everyday damien, bathe me in holy water
nothing like son of sam, so, please, understand there's no gun in hand
where's the thrill in the hunt? there's no fun in that, here i come with axe
fun to act like lumberjack when i'm hackin' 'em up with that
what was that? dial 9-1-1, someone's comin' in from the back


soon as my flow starts i compose art like the ghost of mozart
even though they all say that they're real, i know that most aren't
boy, you think you're clever, don't ya? girl, you think you're so smart
come with me to another side in a world so cold and so dark


(stay wide awake)
a world so dark, a world so cold
a world where on-ly some will go
(stay wide awake)
but none return, when will they learn?
where do they go? god only knows
(stay wide awake)

and make her wear a bathin' suit and take her parasailin'
shady, why do you gotta pick on the lady for?

wow mariah, didn't expect you to go balls out
bitch, shut the fuck up 'fore i put all them phone calls out
you made to my house when you was wildin' out before nick
when you was on my dick and give you something to smile about
how many times you fly to my house, still tryin' to count
better shut your lyin' mouth if you don't want nick findin' out
you probably think 'cause it's been so long
if i had something on you i woulda did it by now
oh, on the contrary, mary poppins, i'm mixin' our studio session down
and sendin' it to masterin' to make it loud
enough dirt on you to murder you
this is what the fuck i do; mariah it ever occur to you
that i still have pictures? however you prefer to do
and that goes for nick too, faggot, you think i'm scurred of you?
you're gonna ruin my career, you better get one
like i'ma sit and fight with you over some slut bitch cunt
that made me put up with her psycho ass over six months
and only spread her legs to let me hit once, yeah
what you gonna say, i'm lucky? tell the public that i was so ugly
that you fuckin' had to be drunk to fuck me?
second base, what the fuck you tell nick, pumpkin?
the second week we were dry humpin', that's gotta count for somethin'
listen, girly, surely you don't want me to talk about how i nutted early
'cause i ejaculated prematurely
and bust all over your belly and you almost started hurling
and said i was gross, go get a towel, your stomach's curling
or maybe you do
but if i'm embarrassin' me, i'm embarrassin' you and don't you dare say it isn't true
as long as that song's gettin' airplay, i'm dissin' you
i'm a hair away from gettin' carried away and gettin' sued
i was gonna stop at sixteen, that was thirty-two
this is thirty-four bars, we ain't even third of the way through
damn slim, mariah played you, mariah who?
oh did i say "whore," nick? i meant a liar too (ha)
like i've been goin' off on you all this time
for no reason, girl, you out your alcoholic mind
check your wine cellar, look at the amounts of all the wine
like i fuckin' sit around and think about you all the time
i just think this shit is funny when i pounce you on a rhyme
but fuck it, now i'm 'bout to draw the line
and for you to cross it that's a mountain that i doubt you wanna climb
i can describe areas of your house you wouldn't find
on an episode of cribs, a blow below the ribs
if i hear another word so don't go openin' your jibs
'cause every time you do it's like an overload of fibs
i ain't sayin' this shit again, ho, you know what it is
it's a warning shot, 'fore i blow up your whole spot
call my bluff and i'll release every fuckin' thing i got
includin' the voicemails right before you flipped your top
when me and luis were tryin' to stick two cds in the same slot


(i love you) i love you, too
let me whisper sweet nothings into your ear, boo
now what you say? (it's nothing) yeah, so what i'll do
is refresh your memory when you said (i want you)
now should i keep goin' or should we call truce?
(you think you're cute, right?) you bet your sweet ass i do
(i'm mary poppins, baby) and i'm superman, ooh
(mary p; slim shady) comin' at you
so if you'll still be my (baby girl)
then i'll still be your (superhero)
(oh and em?) yeah, i'm right here
(you like this) nope, not anymore, dear
it cuts like a (knife) when i tell you get a (life)
but i'm movin' on with mine, nick, is that  your (wife)
well tell her to shut her mouth then i'll leave her alone
if she don't (stick to the script) then i'ma just keep goin'
damn



a lot of people ask me
where the fuck i've been at the last few years

sixty sluts, all of them dyin' from asphyxia
after they sip piss through a christopher reeves sippy cup
dixie cups, toxins, boxes of oxy pads
enough oxycontin to send a fuckin' ox to rehab
wack job in the back in a black stocking cap
jackin' off to a hockey mask at a boxing match
(he can't say that!) yes, he can
i just did, faggot, now guess again
better text message your next-of-kin
tell 'em shit's about to get extra messy
especially when i flex again
and throw a fuckin' lesbian in wet cement
faggoty, faggoty, faggoty! raggedy ann and andy
no! raggedy andy and andy
no, it can't be, it can't be—yes, it can be
the fuckin' anti-christ is back, dante
it's satan in black satin panties
this is amityville, calamity, goddamn it
insanity, pills, fanny pack filled with xannies
through every nook and cranny, lookin' for trannies
milk and cookies spilled on my silk négligée, looky
razor-ba-lades with me to make you ba-leed
cases of maybelline makeup lay on a table of weed
slim shady? shit sounds like a fable to me
'til he jumps out of the fuckin' toilet when you're takin' a pee


here comes the rain and thunder now
nowhere to run, to run to now
i disappeared, don't wonder how
lookin' for me? i'm underground
here comes the rain and thunder now
nowhere to run, to run to now
i disappeared, don't wonder how
lookin' for me? i'm underground


six semen samples, seventeen strands of hair
found in the back of a van after the shoot with vanity fair
hannah montana, prepare to elope with a can opener
and be cut open like cantaloupe on canopy beds
and glad bags, yeah glad to be back
'cause last year was a tragedy that landed me smack-dab in rehab
fuckin' doctor, i ain't understand a damn word he said
i planned to relapse the second i walked out of that bitch
two weeks in brighton, i ain't enlightened
bitin' into a fuckin' vicodin like i'm a viking
oh, lightning is strikin', it might be a fuckin' sign i need a psychic
evaluation, fuck jason, it's friday the 19th
that means it's just a regular day (hah!)
and this is the kind of shit i think of regularly
fuckin' lesbian shouldn't have had her legs in the way
now she's pregnant and gay, missin' both legs and beggin' to stay


here comes the rain and thunder now
nowhere to run, to run to now
i disappeared, don't wonder how
lookin' for me? i'm underground
here comes the rain and thunder now
nowhere to run, to run to now
i disappeared, don't wonder how
lookin' for me? i'm underground


tell the critics i'm back and i'm comin' to spit it back in abundance
hit a fag with onions, then split a bag of funyuns
mad at me? understandable, cannibal, shoot an animal
out of a cannon and have 'em catapult at an adult
captain of a cult with an elite following
to turn halloween back into a trick-or-treat holiday
have michael myers lookin' like a liar, swipe his powers
replace his knife with flowers and a stack of fliers
hit jason vorhees with a 40; stuck a suppository
up his ass, and made him tell me a story
gave hannibal lector a fuckin' nectarine
and sat him in the fuckin' fruit and vegetable section
and gave him a lecture
walked up elm street with a fuckin' wiffle bat drew
fought freddy krueger and edward scissorhands too
and came out with a little scratch, ooh
lookin' like i got in a fuckin' pillow fight with a triple f.a.t. goose
insanity, can it be vanity?
where's the humanity in having a twisted fantasy
with an arm-and-leg amputee?
straitjacket with a hundred and eight brackets
and a strap that wraps twice around my back
then they latch it; cut your fuckin' head off
and ask where you're headed off to
get it? "headed off to?" medic, this headache's awful!
this anesthetic's pathetic, so is this diabetic waffle
and this prosthetic arm keeps crushin' my hard taco


here comes the rain and thunder now
nowhere to run, to run to now
i disappeared, don't wonder how
lookin' for me? i'm underground
here comes the rain and thunder now
nowhere to run, to run to now
i disappeared, don't wonder how
lookin' for me? i'm underground


so, it wasn't a choice, it was "i had to do this"
and now i got 90 days clean
and uh, that's all i have to share, thanks
(thanks for sharing, brian
is there anyone else who'd like to share this evening?)
yeah, i got something to share:
"when you walked through the door you were queer to me
so come here, baby boy, just come here to me
you're a cock-boy, everybody wants you
you're gayer than you would ever claim to
i won't have to rape you
so, homie, lay down, down, down
lay down, down, down
lay down, down, down, lay down, lay down"
where's everybody going?
this always went over real big in gay-a
okay, wait, i got another one
"i just love condoms and lots of cum"
no? well, shit!

jessica alba put her breasts on my mouth (blup!)
