too late for the other side
caught in a chase, twenty-five to life
too late for the other side
caught in a chase, twenty-five to life
too late
(yeah, i can't keep chasing you
i'm taking my life back)
caught in a chase, twenty-five to life


i don't think, she understands the sacrifices that i've made
maybe if this bitch had acted right, i woulda stayed
but i've already wasted over half my life, i woulda laid
down and died for you, i no longer cry for you, no more pain
bitch, you took me for granted
took my heart and ran it straight into the planet
into the dirt, i can no longer stand it
now my respect, i demand it
i'ma take control of this relationship, command it
and i'ma be the boss of you now, goddamn it
and what i mean is that i will no longer let you control me
so, you better hear me out, this much you owe me
i gave up my life for you, totally devoted to you, i have stayed
faithful all the way, this is how i fuckin' get repaid?
look at how i dress, fuckin' baggy sweats, go to work a mess
always in a rush to get back to you, i ain't heard you yet
not even once say you appreciate me, i deserve respect
i've done my best to give you nothin' less than perfectness
and i know that if i end this, i'll no longer have nothin' left
but you keep treatin' me like a staircase, it's time to fuckin' step
and i won't be comin' back so don't hold your fuckin' breath
you know, what you've done, no need to go in-depth
i told you, “you'd be sorry, if i fuckin' left”, i laughed, while you wept
how's it feel now? yeah, funny, ain't it? you neglected me
did me a favor though, my spirit free you've set
but a special place for you in my heart i have kept
it's unfortunate, but it's—


too late for the other side
caught in a chase, twenty-five to life
(yeah, can't take no more)
too late for the other side
caught in a chase, twenty-five to life


i feel, like when i bend over backwards for you, all you do is laugh
'cause that ain't good enough
you expect me to fold myself in half, 'til i snap
don't think i'm loyal, all i do is rap
how can i moonlight on the side? i have no life outside of that
don't i give you enough of my time? you don't think so, do you?
jealous when i spend time with the girls, why i'm married to you still?
man, i don't know, but tonight i'm serving you with papers
i'm divorcing you – go marry someone else and make 'em famous!
and take away their freedom like you did to me
treat 'em like you don't need 'em, and they ain't worthy of you
feed 'em the same shit that you made me eat
i'm moving on, forget you
oh, now i'm special? i ain't feel special, when i was with you
all i ever felt was this helplessness, imprisoned by a selfish bitch
chew me up and spit me out, i fell for this
so many times, it's ridiculous
and still i stick with this, i'm sick of this
but in my sickness and addiction, you're addictive as they get
evil as they come, vindictive as they make 'em
my friends keep askin' me, why i can't just walk away from
i'm addicted to the pain, the stress, the drama, i'm drawn to
shit, i guess i'm a mess, cursed, and blessed, but this time i
ain't changin' my mind, i'm climbin' out this abyss
you're screamin', as i walk out that i'll be missed
but when you spoke of people who meant the most to you, you left me off your list
fuck you, hip hop! i'm leavin' you, my life sentence is served, bitch
and it's just—


too late for the other side
caught in a chase, twenty-five to life
(i'm gone, man)
too late for the other side
caught in a chase, twenty-five to life
too late
caught in a chase, twenty-five to life

i can almost taste it
this shit makes no sense to me
what does it all mean?
i can almost taste it
i can almost see it
this shit makes no sense to me
what does it all mean?
i can almost taste it
i can almost taste it


you dream of trading places, i have been changing faces
you cannot fill these shoes, there is too much to lose
wake up behind these trenches, you run around defenseless
there is too much to lose, you cannot fill these shoes
i just wanna be famous, but...
be careful what you wish for


i stuck my dick in this game like a rapist
they call me slim roethlisberger
i go berserker than a fed-up post office worker
i murk her with a mossberg, i'm pissed off, get murdered
like someone took a ketchup squirter, squirted a frankfurter
for a gangster, you sure did shit your pants
when you saw the chainsaw get to waving like a terrible towel
how thangs turn around when his fangs come out
get your brains blown out, that's what i call blowin' your mind
when i come back, like nut on your spine
i'm a thumb tack that you slept on, son
now here i come, screaming "attack!" like i just stepped on one
low on the totem 'til he showed 'em defiance, giant scrotum
he don't owe them bitches shit, his britches, he outgrowed 'em
he's so out cold, he's knocked out at the south pole
and nobody fucks with him, rigor mortis and post mortem
he's dyin' of boredom
take your best rhymes, record 'em, then try to thwart him
he'll just take your punch lines and snort 'em
shit-stained drawers, you gon' fuck with a guy
who licks the blades of his chainsaws
while he dips 'em in p.f. chang's sauce?
game's up, homie, hang it up like some crank calls
you think i'm backin' down?
you must be out of your dang skulls; i'm almost famous


you dream of trading places, i have been changing faces
you cannot fill these shoes, there is too much to lose
wake up behind these trenches, you run around defenseless
there is too much to lose, you cannot fill these shoes
i just wanna be famous, but...
be careful what you wish for

i'm back for revenge, i lost a battle, that ain't happenin' again
i'm at your throat like strep, i step, strapped with a pen
metaphors wrote on my hand, some are just stored in my memory
some i wrote on a napkin, i do what i have to to win
pullin' out all stops, any who touch a mic prior's
not even austin powers, how the fuck are they mike myers?
and tell that psycho to pass the torch to the wacko
'fore i take a shit in his jack-o-lantern and smash it on his porch
now get off my dick! 'dick''s too short of a word for my dick
get off my antidisestablishmentarianism, you prick!
don't call me the champ, call me the space shuttle destroyer
i just blew up the challenger; matter fact, i need a lawyer
i just laced my gloves with enough plaster to make a cast
beat his ass naked and peed in his corner like verne troyer
y'all are eminem backwards: you're mini mes
see, he's in a whole nother weight class
he's slugs, you're bbs: you're bean-bag bullets
you're full of it, you were dissin' his cd's
laughed at infinite, now he's back like someone pissed in his wheaties
no peace treaties, he's turned into a beast
his new slim shady ep's got the attention of the mighty d.r.e
he's almost famous


you dream of trading places, i have been changing faces
you cannot fill these shoes, there is too much to lose
wake up behind these trenches, you run around defenseless
there is too much to lose, you cannot fill these shoes
i just wanna be famous, but...
be careful what you wish for


now there he goes in dre's studio, cuppin' his balls
screamin' the wood off the panelin', cussin' the paint off the walls
spewin' his hate to these haters, showin' no love for these broads
he ain't givin' them shit, he says he'll pinch a penny so hard
he'll leave a bruise on the bronze so dark you can see the mark
with the scars, 'til abraham lincoln is screamin' out, "ahh!"
these metaphors and similes ain't similar to them, not at all
if they don't like it, they can all get fucked
instead of suckin' him off
they can go get a belt or a neck tie to hang themselves by
like david carradine, they can go fuck themselves and just die
and eat shit while they at it, he's fuckin' had it
he's mad at the whole world
so go to hell and build a snowman, girl
the bullies become bullied, and pussies get pushed
then they better pull me, take me back to 9th grade to school me
'cause i ain't lookin' back, only forward, this whole spot blowin'
who coulda known he'd grow to be a poet and not know it?
and while i'm bein' poetic, let me get it stoic and raise the bar
higher than my opinion of these women's been lowered
so bear witness to some biblical shit, there's a cold wind blowin'
this world ain't gonna know what hit it
he did it, he made it, he's finally famous

yeah, you know, technically
i'm not even really supposed to be here right now
so fuck it, might as well make the most of it
(amen) yeah! ha-ha
(amen) feels good
(amen) woo!
(amen) guess i'm lucky
(amen) some of us don't get a second chance
(amen) but i ain't blowin' this one
(amen) nah, man, ha-ha
(amen) shit, i feel like i can do anything now


who can catch lightning in a bottle, set fire to water
comin' out the nozzle on a fire hose, flyer than swatters?
cinderella man, cinderella man
cinderella man, cinderella man
smash an hourglass, grab the sand, take his hands and cup 'em
spit a rhyme to freeze a clock, take the hands of time and cuff 'em
cinderella man, cinderella man
cinderella man, cinderella man
there's a storm comin' that the weatherman couldn't predict
i start to bug, prick, you better flee, 'cause i get ticked
it's a wrap, i was down, when i was down i was kicked
i got up, i'm back to punch you to the ground, you're tricked
it's a trap, fuck my last cd, the shit's in my trash
i'll be goddamned if another rapper gets in my ass
i hit the gas and i spit every rap as if it's my last
you can die in the blink of an eye, so bat your eyelashes
and keep winkin' and blowin' kisses 'cause you're flirtin' with death
i'm destroyin' your livelihood, i ain't just hurtin' your rep
i catch a flow and get goin', no remorse i'm showin', ain't slowin'
for no one, knowin' there's nothin' you can do about it
zero in on my target like a marksman, the target is you
i shut your lane down, took your spot, parked in it too
arsenic flow, lighter fluid, saliva—what can you do?
go get your crew to hype you up, stand behind you like, "woo!"
that boy's hot enough to melt hell, burn satan too
fry his ass and put his ashes back together with glue
so you can hate him, he don't blame you, frankly, he would too
this game could ill afford to lose him, how 'bout you?


now guess who? (hey) here's a clue (hey)
he came to the ball in his wife beater, lost his nike shoe
it's in your ass (hey), he's in your ass, he's all up in your psyche too (hey)
now (hey) what's his name?


fuck catchin' lightning, he struck it, screamed, "shut up!" at thunder
then flipped the world upside down and made it rain upward
cinderella man, cinderella man
cinderella man, cinderella man
rewound the future to the present, paused it, don't ask how
fuck the past, motherfucker, he's the shit right now, he's
cinderella man, cinderella man
cinderella man, cinderella man
cinderella man, cinderfella shady dane, came
to wrap the game up in cellophane, raise hell, from hell he came
but didn't come to bore you with the cinderella story
nor did he come to do the same old can't afford to be
a lame-o in this day and age and at this stage of the game
mediocrity can no longer be allowed to fly, so say bye
to the old, h-i to the new, que será
consider it his last hurrah, the coup de grâce, raise 'em high
in the sky, keep 'em up, time to bring the place alive
thanks for bein' patient, i won't make no more mistakes, shit, my
potato's baked, homie, the veggies on my plate can fly
my filet is smokin' weed—yeah, faggot, the stakes are high
shit, i ain't even s'posed to be here by the grace of god
the skin on my teeth and a hair on my nuts, i skated by
now y'all are on thin ice with ankle weights, i'd hate to lie
how fuckin' irritated are you? how much in your face am i?
and ain't shit you can do but fear it, proof is here in spirit
and i'm his spittin' image, i mirror it when i stand near it
your pussy lyric, i "cunt" hear it
who forms pyramids and raps circles around square lyricists?


who? (hey) here's a clue (hey)
he came to the ball in his wife beater, lost his nike shoe
it's in your ass (hey), he's in your ass, he's all up in your psyche too (hey)
now (hey) what's his name?



yeah
ooh...
this game is like cocaine
i want this more than anything in the world
haha... so do i... at least i thought i did
got to have it, yeah i need it, i'm addicted, yeah i'm fading


this is a beat with no words at first, it’s a blank painting
exercising the mind, it’s brain strength training
it starts off something like, "shady's an insane maniac
yeah, slim shady, that's a zany name, ain't it?"
now all you need's an image to go with the name, baby
wifebeaters and white t-shirts, hanes mainly
it's a long shot, but is it possible? there's a lane, maybe
if not he's gon' have to come and change the whole game, ain't he?
he wants the fame so bad he can taste it, he can see his name up in lights
women screaming his fucking name, fainting
shady did it, he sold out the whole dang stadium
joe shmoe made it, he took his plain jane lady
and his baby hailie out the trailer but he ain't trailing anymore
he's ahead of the race while maintaining his innocence
little does he know his train is derailing
and he's about to be raped by this game anally, now


you’re operating on all cylinders, syllables spit like dillingers
spilling your guts, people are feeling your mic skills
but these haters are ice grilling ya
willing to sacrifice anything for the life that they might steal from ya
fake friends will kill for ya, die for ya but you can’t decipher
why for the life of ya, it wasn’t like this when you were cyphering
argue with your wife again, she found vicodin
in your pants last night again, your dispute's public
nothing is private anymore, oh, and your best friend?
say bye-bye to him, what kind of apple you take a bite of, slim?
(but this is what you wanted marshall, ain't it?) fuck no!
the way that it turned out was nothin' like the picture that i painted
in my head, sometimes a dream and making it's more fun
than it's to actually make it, the game stripped me naked
it robbed me of ever having another real relationship
with another girl, this world is a fucking trip
as i slip in another world, proceed, take another hit
sniff 'til i fucking hurl, tell 'em all to fucking sit
and spin 'til they fucking twirl, middle finger up again
relapsing back in this game, oh well, fuck it then, now


guess i can't leave it
so i'm ?
oh well... (fame, fame)
(fame)

'cause some things just don't change
it's better when they stay the same
although the whole world knows your name
so on a biggest stage, they
came to see you spit your game, ho-woah
but it shouldn't be difficult to explain
just why you came back again
you hate the fame, love the game
cold as ice, you remain
fuck 'em all, tell 'em all, “eat shit!”
here we go again


oh! (dum, du-du-du-dum, dum-du-dum) (yeah, yup, yeah)
god damn! (dum, du-du-du-dum, dum-du-du)
is it that time again already? (dum, du-du-du-dum, dum-du-dum)
haha (okay, okay) (dum, du-du-du-dum, dum-du-du)
y'all don't look too happy to see me (dum, du-du-du-dum, dum-du-dum)
fuck, man (dum, du-du-du-dum, dum-du-du)
don't everybody welcome me back at once (dum, du-du-du-dum, dum-du-dum)
alright, fuck you all then (dum, du-du-du-dum, dum)


you can get the dick, just call me the ballsack, i'm nuts
michael vick in this bitch, dog—fall back, you mutts
fuck your worms, you've never seen such a sick puppy
fuck it, a sick duck, i want my duck sicked, mummy
and my nuts licked, gobble 'em up, trick, yummy
bitch, you don't fuckin' think, i know that you suck dick, dummy?
you'll get your butt kicked, fuck all that love shit, honey
yeah, i laugh, when i call you a slut, it's funny
shorty, dance while i diss you to the beat, fuck the words
you don't listen to 'em anyway, yeah, struck a nerve, sucker
muh'fucker, might as well let my lips pucker
like elton john, 'cause i'm just a mean cocksucker
the shit is on 'cause you went and pissed me off, now i'm shittin' and pissin' on
everybody, give a fuck if it's right or wrong
so puff the buddha, light a bong
but take a look at mariah next time i inspire you to write a song
come on


oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh, oh
i'm as cold as the cold wind blows
when it snows and it's twenty below
ask me why, man, i just don't know
know-know-know, know-know, know
i'm as cold as the cold wind blows
bl-bl-blows, blow-blow, blows; oh, oh-oh


fuck it, i'm a loose cannon
bruce banner's back in the booth
y'all are sittin' ducks, i'm the only goose standin'
i'll set the world on fire, piss on it, put it out
stick my dick in a circle, but i'm not fuckin' around
motherfucker, i'll show you pussy-footin'
i'll kick a bitch in the cunt
'til it makes a queef and sounds like a fuckin' whoopee cushion
who the fuck is you pushin'?
you must've mistook me for some sissy soft punk
lookin' for some nookie or bosom
go ahead, fuckin' hater, push me
i told you ain't no fuckin' way to shush me
call me a faggot 'cause i hate a pussy
man the fuck up, sissy, g's up
all you gardeners freeze up—
put your hoes down, "shady, ease up!
man, chill!" nah, i can't, goddamn it, rap is a landfill
drop the anvil, these are shoes that you can't fill
shit, the day that happens the world will stop spinnin'
and michael j. fox'll come to a standstill (woo!)
during an earthquake, urine in your face 'cause you're fake
*lightning strike* ow! what the fuck? that hurt, wait
*lightning strike* ow! what the fuck? i just got struck by lightnin'
alright then, i quit, god, i give up
call it evil that men do
lord, forgive me, for what my pen do
"this is for your sins, i cleanse you
you can repent, but i warn you, if you continue
to hell, i send you"
and just then the wind blew, and i said—


oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh, oh
i'm as cold as the cold wind blows
when it snows and it's twenty below
ask me why, man, i just don't know
know-know-know, know-know, know
i'm as cold as the cold wind blows
bl-bl-blows, blow-blow, blows; oh, oh-oh-oh, oh


how long will i be this way? shady until my dyin' day
'til i hang up the mic and it's time for me to say
“so long,” 'til then i'll drop the fuckin' bombs
like i missed the pass, when i went long
if you don't like it, you can kiss my ass in a lint thong
now sing along, “slut this, slut that,” learn the words to the song
“oh, bitches don't like that”, homie, i'll be nicer to women
when aquaman drowns, and the human torch starts swimmin'
man, i'm a cold soul, i roll solo, so don't compare
me to them other bums over there
it's like apples to oranges, peaches to plums, yeah
i'm bananas, pussy, cut off the grapes and grow a pair
but i swear, you try to diss me, i'll slaughter you
i put that on everything, like everyone does with auto-tune
the last thing you want to do
is have me spit out a rhyme, and say, “i was writing this and i thought of you”
so—


oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh, oh
i'm as cold as the cold wind blows
when it snows and it's twenty below
ask me why, man, i just don't know
know-know-know, know-know, know
i'm as cold as the cold wind blows
bl-bl-blows, blow-blow, blows; oh, oh-oh-oh, oh


i don't know, i don't know what caused
i don't know what caused me to be this way
i don't know, i don't know
but i'll prob'ly be this way 'til my dyin' day
i don't know why i'm so, i'm so cold
mean things i don't mean to say
i guess, this is how you made me

ugh, ha (da-na na-na-na)
nah, fuck an intro, man, let's just go (yeah!)


i come around like what goes around
what goes up must come down
anyone who comes up must go down
might as well go for the gusto now
better not let up, better not let them breathe
last shot, give it all you got
try to turn me down, bitch
get fucked with a volume knob, fuck all you snobs
hoes, i hope all you rot
two bottles of lubriderm and a box of condoms
is that all you brought?
and you want a ménage à trois, you twats?
fuck that, i'd rather turn this club to a barroom brawl
get rowdy as roethlisberger in a bathroom stall
like a leech stuck in a vacuum, y'all
ain't nothing but a whole lot of sucking going on in rap
yeah, but i'm home
bad to the bone, back in the zone
let him alone, you don't wanna go eggin' him on
it'll never be my chair that you own
crown so tight that it cuts off circulation to the brain
no oxygen—other words, there's no heir to the throne
when i die so does hip-hop
hitchcock of the shit, bitch, ask doc
got it ziplocked in a bag
you fags ain't been able to fade me since kid rock had a high-top
keep bloggin' while i mind-boggle
and i zone like i'm in the twilight, dog
get off my bone, this is my mic, dogg-one it
i like hoggin' it
flows so wet, i'ma take this beat tobogganing
i'm waterloggin' it—i'm sogging it
pull your verse out the beat and stomp on it
suplexing it on cement
like i'm on some "straight outta compton" shit
take this dick and chomp on it
i'm so bad i can bitchslap a backhanded compliment
jackass, eat a donkey dick
the game i just about conquered it
like donkey kong, i'm bonkers, bitch
i'm the king of this honkey shit
i reign supreme in this honkey shit
no sense screaming and arguing
makes no difference whether a benz or a bentley
or a bimmer's the car you in
you think you ball? well, i palm it
i throw up bombs when i vomit
boy, i throw down in the kitchen
might hit your mom with my omelette
but you got egg on your face
now watch me drop an atomic
i should be strapped to the chest of a kamikaze
bitch, i'm as batshit as ozzy
it's obvious, you can tell right off the bat
no pun intended, but come any closer, i'll bite off your head
tryna give me the finger's kinda like giving a spider the web
i'm just gonna spin it and try to use it to my advantage
i'll catch a fly in that bitch, you think you fly, you just food
i give as much of a flying fuck as that superman dude
guess i just do what you can't do
and make you look stupid and bamboozled
confused as usual and you can get whipped
she can open a can, too
but you better hope you can handle the heat
or stay the fuck outta hell's kitchen
i came to cockblock like a square fucking male chicken
yeah, it's shady, slut, the rest can suck on that big one
'cause i'm as despicable as daffy duck when i'm spittin'


haha, recovery

they ask me am i okay, they ask me if i'm happy
are they askin' me that because of the shit that's been thrown at me?
or am i just a little snappy and they genuinely care?
doody, most of my life, it's just been me and you there
and i continuously stare at pictures of you
i never got to say i love you as much as i wanted to, but i do
yeah, i say it now when you can't hear me
what the fuck good does that do me now?
but somehow, i know you're near me, your presence
oh, i went and dropped some presents off for easter
to them two little beautiful boys of yours to try to ease their
minds a little, and dog, you'll never believe this
but sharonda actually talks to me now—jesus!
and everyone else is just tryin' to pick up the pieces
man, how could you touch so many fuckin' lives and just leave us?
they say grievance has it's way of affectin' everyone different
if it's true, how the fuck i'm supposed to get over you?
difficult as it sounds


"doody," that's what we'd call each other
i don't know where it came from
but it just stuck with us, we was always brothers
never thought about each other's skin colors
'til one day we was walkin' up the block in the summer
it was like ninety degrees, i was catchin' a sunburn
tryin' to walk under the trees just to give me some comfort
i moan and i just wanna get home and
i look over and your shirt is off
i'm like, "you're gonna fry," you're like, "no, i won't
i'm black, stupid! and black people they got melatonin
in their skin—we don't burn," meanwhile my face is glowin'
and i feel like i'm on fire
and the entire time you're just laughin' at me
and snappin' at me with your shirt, bastard
and i still have to get you back for that shit
and by the way, them playboy rings my mother stole from you
well, nate finally got 'em back, shit
it must've been at least 16 years ago
well, i put 'em in your cask—oww
movin' past it, it still ain't registered yet
but you can bet, your legacy they'll never forget
the motor city, motown, hip hop vet
hip hop shop, dreads, it don't stop there
yeah, as difficult as it sounds


and this might sound a little strange but i'ma tell it
i found that jacket that you left at my wedding
and i picked it up to smell it
i wrapped it up in plastic until i put it in glass
and hang up in the hallway so i can always look at it
and as for all me and d12 we feel like "fuck rap!"
it feels like our general just fuckin' died in our lap
we shut off all our pagers, all our cell numbers is changed
our two-ways are in the trash
so some cats will have to find a new way
and i know it feels like the dreams will die with you today
but the truth is they're all still here and you ain't
purple gang, you gotta keep pressin' on
don't ever give up the dream, dog, i got love for you all
and doody, it's true you brought people together
who never woulda been in the same room if it wasn't for you
you were the peacemaker, doody
i know sometimes you were moody
but you hated confrontation and truly hated the feuding
but you was down for yours whenever it came to scrappin'
if it had to happen, it had to happen
believe me, i know you're the one who taught me to throw them 'bows back on dresden
from eggin' cars to paintballin', gettin' arrested
to sittin' across from each other in cells, laughin' and jestin'
they tried to hit us for five years for that, no question
i guess them hookers and bums that we shot up didn't show up for court, so we got off on a technicality, left sweatin'
me, you and… what's his face? i forgot his fuckin' name
shame he even came to your funeral, he betrayed our team
and if i see him again i'ma punch him in the fuckin' face
and that’s on hailie jade, whitney laine and alaina’s name
i let the pistol bang once just to lick a shot
in the air for you and pour some liquor out
with obie in the parking lot of 54 just before
we were supposed to get in cars to come and see you once more
difficult as it sounds



doody, így hívtuk mi egymást
nem tudom már honnan jött ez
de valahogy ránk ragadott, mindig is tesók voltunk
sosem érdekelt minket egymás bőrszíne
míg nem egy nap csak sétáltunk egy nyári napon lent a téren
lehetett vagy 90 fok, én meg le is égtem
próbáltam a fák alá húzódni, hogy egy kis kényelembe helyezzem magamat
csak nyafogok hogy végre érjek már haza
aztán utánad nézek, erre azt látom hogy te leveszed a pólódat én meg erre „megfogsz sülni” te meg „nem dehogy, hisz én fekete vagyok, hülye”! és a feketék bőrébe melatonin van-mi nem égünk le” közben az arcom izzad
és úgy érzem hogy felgyulladok
és te meg egész idő alatt röhögsz rajtam
és meg csapkodsz a pólóddal, te szemét!
és ezt még mindig vissza akarom adni neked!
és amúgy meg azokat a playboyos gyűrűket amiket anyám megfújt tőled, végre nate megtalálta és vissza adta
basszus… kb 16 éve lehetett, nos
beteszem őket az ékszereid közé
túlteszem magamat rajta, de igazából még most sem fogtam fel mindezt
de arra mérget vehetsz, hogy a hagyatékod sosem fog feledésbe merülni
a motor city, motown, hip hop veterán
a hip hop shopban való izgalmak, mindez nem áll itt le, ja ez valóban olyan nehéz amilyennek hangzik


és ez lehet hogy egy kicsit furán hangzik, de elmondom, hogy megtaláltam az a dzsekit amit az esküvőmön hagytál, aztán felvettem és  csak megszagoltam
összehajtottam és egy üvegvitrinbe tettem
aztán levittem a folyosóra, hogy bármikor rátudjak nézni
és mi mindannyian, én meg a d12 úgy érzünk hogy „basszameg a rap!”
ez olyan számunkra mintha a tábornokunk a kibaszott karjaink közt halt volna meg
kikapcsoltuk az össze személyhívónkat, a postafiókjaink száma is mind megváltozott
a másik énjeinket a szemétbe dobtuk
tehát, néhány macskának új utat kell majd találniuk
és tudom hogy ez olyan mintha az álmok, veled együtt meghalnának ma
de az az igazság az hogy azok még mindig jelen vannak, de te már nem vagy itt
purple gang, annyira beakartad őket futtatni
ne adjátok fel az álmaitokat, tesó, én szeretlek titeket mindannyiótokat
és doody, az az igazság hogy összehoztad az embereket, olyanokat akik amúgy sosem jöttek volna össze egy szobában
ha nem miattad lett volna
te voltál a béketeremtő, doody
tudom hogy néha rosszkedvű voltál
de utáltad a konfrontációkat és igazából utáltad a vitákat
de kiálltál a sajátjaidért, még ha balhéra is került sor
ha valaminek megkellett történnie, akkor annak meg kellett
higgyél nekem, tudom hogy te vagy az aki megtanított arra hogy hogy vágjak vissza még dresdenben, amikor a kocsikat festékpatronokkal lövöldöztük, letartoztattak minket és egymással szembe ültünk a cellában  és csak röhögtünk azon hogy ezért 5 évre akartak minket rács mögé dugni
de asszem azok a ribancok meg faszok, akikre rálőttünk még csak meg se jelentek a bíróságon, szóval technikailag szabadon elsétálhattunk
én te meg… ki is volt ő? elfelejtettem a kibaszott nevét
szégyen hogy még a temetésedre is eljött, elárulta a csapatunkat
és ha még egyszer meglátom őt, esküszöm hogy kibaszottul pofán vágom
és ezt hallie jade, whitney laine és alliana nevében is mondom
egy pisztoly lövést leadtam az égbe
csak is érted, és megittunk néhány italt
obieval a 54 parkolójában, mielőtt még beszálltunk a kocsiba, hogy még egyszer láthassunk téged
ez valóban olyan nehéz amilyennek hangzik



yeah
yo, yo
*clears throat*
aight


i'm like a white michael – vick, psycho enough to stick
michael j. fox in a microwave with a rott
i might make a little alizé with a side of nyquil
and ride a motorcycle bike right through the side of my high school (woo!)
satan's disciple wit' a sniper rifle and a knife
and a white diaper, liable to shit on you while i snipe you
so dope, he gets off opiates, what an appropriate
way to start off his day!, he may just smart off to dre (woo!)
he may be hard to contain, 'cause his rage is so hard to gauge
see, hannibal ate his face, and met jason, gnawed off his leg
amazin' hard-on for razors and blades and anything sharp
even poisonous darts, it all plays a major part of his game
holy water won't ward him off, crucifixes won't do the trick
he's so sick, it's ridiculous, sawed the crazy part off his brain and he's still insane
why's there bloodstains on his carpet, mane?
there's some crazy shit goin' on in shady's apartment again, ooh!


uh (ouch)
yo, yeah'
yeah, can you turn it up a little bit?


newsflash, i'm still trash
them pills shoulda killed my ass (alchemist)
but they didn't; they just made me stronger
it's like they rebuilt my ass
like the six million dollar man after the crash
it's aftermath, bitch! and my milk glass is still half-empty
yeah, tempt me, hell isn't enough
they need to invent somewhere new to send me
as sick as i'm getting
they'll stick me in a conventional oven
with a rotisserie setting and won't even notice me sweating
shit, i done made a verse, said some foul shit
tryna go back fix it, fucked around, and just made it worse
yeah, i'm back, looking no worse for wear
got these haters mad enough to rip off their hair
and start punchin' the air
panties so in a bunch that they can't function
it's shady and royce, fuck yeah! what a dysfunctional pair!
so stop actin' like a punk, get a pair!
take a pill and fall the fuck out, spill your lunch in the chair!


uh, yo


i'll do a hundred-yard dash just to slash kim kardash'
in the ass with a shard of glass from nick hogan's car crash
you may look like the passenger for that, don't be a smartass
yeah, laugh while you sit there thinkin' that the hard part passed
you ain't seen pain 'til leatherface flips mane
i'll cut your fuckin' balls off, homie, my saw's off the chain
i chopped the bitch in half with it, sawed off her legs
and the top half of the torso fuckin' crawled off insane
i ain't seen shit like that since i went to mike jack's
took the elephant man's skull, fucked it, and put it right back
handed my dick to bubbles while he sucked it and licked my nut sack
gave him a reach-around while i fucked him right in his butt crack
nah, i ain't takin' it back, faggot, fuck that!
i give a fuck about nothin', so here's where you fucked up at
don't go touchin' that can, man you don't wanna open up that
wait a min, ah, shit… alchemist, cut that!



lately, i really
feel like i'm rollin' for delf like philly
feel like i'm losin' control of myself, i sincerely
apologize if all that i sound like
is i'm complainin' but life keeps on complicatin', and
i'm debatin' on leavin' this world this evenin'
even my girls can see i'm grievin', i try and hide it
but i can't, why do i act like i'm all high and mighty
when inside i'm dyin'? i am finally realizin' i need
help, can't do it myself, too weak
two weeks, i've been havin' ups and downs
goin' through peaks and valleys
dilly-dallyin' 'round with the idea
of endin' this shit right here, i'm hatin' my reflection
i walk around the house tryna fight mirrors
i can't stand what i look like, yeah
i look fat, but what do i care? i give a fuck
only thing i fear's hailie
i'm afraid if i close my eyes
that i might see her... shit


i lock myself in the bedroom, bathroom, nappin' at noon
yeah, dad's in a bad mood, he's always snappin' at you
marshall, what happened that you can't stop with these pills?
and you've fallen off with your skills and your own fans are laughin' at you
it become a problem you're too pussy to tackle? get up
be a man, stand, a real man woulda had this shit handled
know you just had your heart ripped out and crushed
they say proof just flipped out, homie just whipped out and bust
nah, it ain't like doody to do that, he wouldn't fuckin'
shoot at nobody, he'd fight first, but dwellin'
on it only makes the night worse, now i'm poppin' vics, percs
and methadone pills, "yeah, em, tight verse
you killed it!" fuckin' drug dealers hang around me like yes men
and they gon' do whatever i says when i says it
it's in their best interest to protect their investment
and i just lost my fuckin' best friend, so fuck it, i guess then—


(i'm going through changes) don’t know what i’m gonna do
(i'm going through changes) but i just keep on going through changes


my friends can't understand this new me, that's understandable
man, but think how bananas you'd be, you'd be an animal too
if you were trapped in this fame and caged in it like a zoo
and everybody's lookin' at you, what you want me to do?
i'm startin' to live like a recluse
and the truth is, fame's startin' to give me an excuse
to be at an all-time low; i sit alone in my home theater
watchin' the same damn dvd of the
first tour; the last tour, he was still alive
and it hurts so i fast forward, sleeping pills'll make me feel alright
and if i'm still awake in the middle of the night
i'll just take a couple more, yeah, you're motherfuckin' right
i ain't slowin' down for no one, i am almost homeward bound
almost in a coma, yeah homie, come on, dole 'em out!
"daddy, don't you die on me! daddy, better hold your ground!"
fuck, don't i know the sound of that voice? yeah, baby, hold me down (daddy!)


(i'm going through changes) (daddy!) don’t know what i’m gonna do
(i'm going through changes) but i just keep on going through changes


wake up in the hospital, full of tubes
but somehow i'm pullin' through
swear when i come back i'ma be bulletproof
i'ma do it just for proof, i think i should state a few
facts, 'cause i may not get a chance again to say the truth
shit, it just hit me that what if i would not've made it through?
i think about the things i woulda never got to say to you
i'd never get to make it right, so here's what i came to do
hailie, this one is for you, whitney and alaina too
i still love your mother, that'll never change
think about her every day
we just could never get it together, hey
wish there was a better way for me to say it
but i swear on everything, i'd do anything for her on any day
there are just too many things to explain
when it rains, guess it pours — yes, it does
wish there wasn't any pain, but i can't pretend there ain't
i ain't placin' any blame
i ain't pointin' fingers, heaven knows i never been a saint
i know that it feels like we just pissed away our history
and just today i looked at your picture, almost if to say
i miss you subconsciously, wish it didn't end this way
but i just had to get away, don't know why, i don't know what else to say
i guess i'm—


(i'm going through changes) don’t know what i’m gonna do
(i'm going through changes) but i just keep on going through changes

i'm like a white michael vick, psycho enough to stick
michael j. fox in a microwave with a rott (ell-ell-elle)
i might make a little alizé with a side of nyquil
and ride a motorcycle right through the side of my high school
satan's disciple with a sniper rifle
and a knife and a white diaper
liable to shit on you while i snipe you
so dope he gets off opiates
what an appropriate way to start off his day
he may just smart off to dre
he may be hard to contain
‘cause his rage is so hard to gauge
see, hannibal ate his face, and met jason, gnawed off his leg
amazin' hard-on for razors and blades
and anything sharp, even poisonous darts
it all plays a major part of his game
holy water won't ward him off, crucifixes won't do the trick
he's so sick, it's ridiculous
sawed the crazy part off his brain, he's still insane
why's there bloodstains on his carpet, mane?
there's some crazy shit goin' on in shady's apartment again (woosh)


newsflash, i'm still trash
them pills shoulda killed my ass
but they didn't; they just made me stronger
it's like they rebuilt my ass
like the six million dollar man after the crash

yeah, i'm back, looking no worse for wear
got these haters mad enough to rip off their hair
and start punchin' the air
fall the fuck out, spill your lunch in the chair (eww)


(chicka) i'll do a hundred-yard dash just to slash kim kardash'
in the ass with a shard of glass from nick hogan's car crash
you may look like the passenger for that, don't be a smartass
yeah, laugh while you sit there
thinkin' that the hard part passed
you ain't seen pain 'til leatherface flips mane
i'll cut your fuckin' balls off, homie, my saw's off the chain
i chopped the bitch in half with it, sawed off her legs

gave him a reach-around
while i fucked him right in his butt crack
nah, i ain't takin' it back fo.., fuck that!
i give a fuck about nothin', so here's where you fucked up at
don't go touchin' that can
man, you don't wanna open up that


wait a min-ahh, shit… alchemist, cut that..
(laughter, record scratching)

i can't tell you what it really is, i can only tell you what it feels like
and right now, there's a steel knife in my windpipe
i can't breathe, but i still fight while i can fight
as long as the wrong feels right, it's like i'm in flight
high off her love, drunk from her hate
it's like i'm huffin' paint and i love her, the more i suffer, i suffocate
and right before i'm about to drown, she resuscitates me
she fuckin' hates me, and i love it — "wait!
where you going?" — "i'm leaving you!" — "no, you ain't!
come back!" — we're runnin' right back, here we go again
it's so insane, 'cause when it's goin' good, it's goin' great
i'm superman with the wind at his back, she's lois lane
but when it's bad, it's awful, i feel so ashamed
i snapped, "who's that dude?", i don't even know his name
i laid hands on her, i'll never stoop so low again
i guess i don't know my own strength


you ever love somebody so much you can barely breathe when you're with 'em?
you meet, and neither one of you even know what hit 'em
got that warm fuzzy feelin', yeah, them chills, used to get 'em
now you're gettin' fuckin' sick of lookin' at 'em?
you swore you'd never hit 'em, never do nothin' to hurt 'em
now you're in each other's face
spewin' venom in your words when you spit 'em
you push, pull each other's hair, scratch, claw, bit 'em
throw 'em down, pin 'em
so lost in the moments when you're in 'em
it's the rage that took over, it controls you both
so they say you're best to go your separate ways
guess that they don't know ya
'cause today, that was yesterday, yesterday is over
it's a different day, sound like broken records playin' over
but you promised her, next time you'll show restraint
you don't get another chance, life is no nintendo game
but you lied again
now you get to watch her leave out the window
guess that's why they call it window pane

now, i know we said things, did things that we didn't mean
then we fall back into the same patterns, same routine
but your temper's just as bad as mine is, you're the same as me
when it comes to love, you're just as blinded, baby, please
come back, it wasn't you, baby, it was me
maybe our relationship isn't as crazy as it seems
maybe that's what happens when a tornado meets a volcano
all i know is i love you too much to walk away though
come inside, pick up your bags off the sidewalk
don't you hear sincerity in my voice when i talk?
told you this is my fault, look me in the eyeball
next time i'm pissed, i'll aim my fist at the drywall
next time? there won't be no next time!
i apologize, even though i know it's lies
i'm tired of the games, i just want her back, i know i'm a liar
if she ever tries to fuckin' leave again, i'ma tie her
to the bed and set this house on fire, just gonna—

just gonna stand there and watch me burn?
well, that's all right because i like the way it hurts
just gonna stand there and hear me cry?
well, that's all right because i love the way you lie
i love the way you lie
i love the way you lie

they ask me am i ok
they ask me if i'm happy
are they asking me that because of the shit that's been thrown at me
or am i just a little snappy
and they genuinely care
doody, most of my life its just been me and you there
and i continuosly stare at pictures of you
i never got to say i love you as much as i wanted to but i do
yeah i say it now and you can't hear me
what the fuck good does that do me now
but somehow i know you're near me in presence
oh i went and drop some presents off to ease it to them
two little beautiful boys of yours to try to ease their minds a little
and dawg you'll never believe this
but sharonda actually talks to me now
jesus and everyone else is just tryna pick up the pieces
man how you touch so many fucking lives and just leave us
they say grievance has a way of affecting everyone different
if it's true, how the fuck am i supposed to get over you
difficult as it sounds...


doody, that's what we call each other
i don't know where it came from but it just stuck with us
we was always brothers
never thought about each others' skin colours
til one day we was walking up the block in the summer
it was like 90 degrees, i was catching a sun burn
tryna walk under the trees
just to give me some comfort
i'm moaning i just wanna get home
when i look over and your shirt is off
i'm like you gonna fry and like
"no i won't, i'm black stupid
and black people they got melatonin
in their skin, we don't burn"
meanwhile, my face is glowing and i felt
like i'm on fire
and the entire time you're just laughing at me
and snapping at me with your shirt, bastard
and i still have to get you back for that shit
and by the way them playboy rings
my mother stole from you
well nate finally got em back
shit it must have been at least 16 years ago
well i put em in your cask-ahhh
moving past it, it still ain't registered yet
but you can bet your legacy they'll never forget
the motor city motown
hip hop vet, hip hop shop, dreads
it don't stop there
yeah, as difficult as it sounds...


and this may sound a little strange but i'mma tell it
i found that jacket that you left at my wedding
and i picked it up to smell it
i wrapped it up in plastic until i put it in glass
and hang it up in the hallway so i can always look at it
and as for all of me and d12 we feel like fuck rap
it feels like our general just fucking died in our lap
we shut off all our pages
all our cell numbers has changed
our two-ways are in the trash
so some cats will have to find a new way
and i know that it feels like the dreams will die with you today
but the truth is there all still here and you ain't
purple gang, you gotta keep pressing on
don't ever give up the dream dawg
i got love for you all
and doody, it's true you bought people together who never
woulda been in the same room if it wasn't for you
you were the peacemaker doody
i know sometimes you were moody
but you hated confrontation
and truly hated the feuding
but you were down for yours whenever it came to scrapping
if it had to happen, it had to happen
believe me, i know you're the one who taught me to
throw them balls back on dresden
from making cars to paintballing
getting arrested
to sitting across from each other in cells laughing and jesting
they tried to hit us for 5 years for that, no question
i guess them hookers and bums that we shot up
didn't show up for court
so we got off on a technicality, left sweating
me, you and what's his face
i forgot his fucking name
shame he even came to your funeral
he betrayed our team
and if i see him again i'mma punch him in the fucking face
and that's on hallie jade, whitney lane and alaina's name
i let the pistol bang once just to leak a shot in the air
for you and pour some liquor out for you with obie in the parking lot of 54
just before we were supposed to get in cars
to come and see you once more
difficult as it sounds



love, love
love, love, love

don't hurt me
don't hurt me no more
young money, yeah
no more
uh
love


it's a little too late to say that you're sorry now (yeah)
you kicked me when i was down
but what you say just don't (don't hurt me)
that's right, it don't (don't hurt me)
and i don't need you (no more)
don't wanna see you (no more)

and i don't need you (no more)

i'm alive again
more alive than i have been in my whole entire life, i can (yeah)
see these people's ears perk up as i begin
to spaz with the pen
uh, i'm a little bit sicker than most
shit's finna get thick again
they say the competition is stiff
but i get a hard dick from this shit, now stick it in
i ain't never giving in again (yeah)
caution to the wind, complete freedom
look at these rappers, how i treat 'em
so why the fuck would i join 'em when i beat 'em? (yeah!)
they call me a freak, 'cause
i like to spit on these pussies 'fore i eat 'em (haha)
man, get these wack cocksuckers off stage!
where the fuck is kanye when you need him? (oh!)
snatch the mic from 'em, bitch, i'ma let you finish in a minute
yeah, that rap was tight, but i'm (yeah!)
'bout to spit the greatest verse of all time
so you might want to go back to the lab tonight and, um (yeah!)
scribble out them rhymes you were gonna spit
and start over from scratch and write new ones
but i'm afraid that it ain't gonna make no difference
when i rip this stage and tear it in half tonight
it's an adrenaline rush to feel the bass thump
from the place all the way to the parking lot, fellow
set fire to the mic and ignite the crowd (yeah)
you can see the sparks from hot metal (yeah)
cold-hearted, from the day i bogarted
the game, my soul started to rot, fellow (yeah)
when i'm not even in my harshest
you can still get roasted, 'cause marsh is not mellow
'til i'm topplin' from the top, i'm not gonna stop
i'm standin' on my monopoly board (uh)
that means i'm on top of my game
and it don't stop 'til my hip don't hop anymore (shit)
when you're so good that you can't say it
'cause it ain't even cool for you to sound cocky anymore (shit)
people just get sick 'cause you spit
these fools can't drool or dribble a drop anymore (ow!)
and you can never break my stride (nope)
you'll never slow the momentum at any moment, i'm 'bout to blow
you'll never take my pride
killin' the flow, slow venom and the opponent is gettin' no
mercy, mark my words
ain't lettin' up, relentless, i smell blood
i don't give a fuck, keep givin' them hell
where was you when i fell and needed help up?
you get no love


it's a little too late to say that you're sorry now (uh)
you kicked me when i was down
but what you say just don't (don't hurt me)
yeah, that's right, it don't (don't hurt me)
and i don't need you (no more)
don't wanna see you (no more)
ha, bitch, you get no (love)
you showed me nothing but hate (yeah!)
you ran me into the ground
but what comes around goes around
and i don't need you (don't hurt me)
that's right, you don't (don't hurt me)
and i don't need you (no more)
don't wanna see you
ha, bitch, you get (no love)
no! (no love) no! (no love) no! (no love)
ha, bitch, you get (no love)
no! (no love) no! (no love)
and i don't need you (no more)
ha, bitch, you get no (love)

(i'm not afraid) yeah
(to take a stand) it's been a ride
(everybody) i guess i had to
(come take my hand) go to that place to get to this one
(we'll walk this road together, through the storm) now some of you
(whatever weather, cold or warm) might still be in that place
(just lettin' you know that you're not alone) if you're tryna get out
(holla if you feel like you've been down the same road) just follow me, i'll get you there


you can try and read my lyrics off of this paper before i lay 'em
but you won't take the sting out these words before i say 'em
'cause ain't no way i'ma let you stop me from causin' mayhem
when i say i'ma do somethin', i do it
i don't give a damn what you think, i'm doin' this for me
so fuck the world, feed it beans, it's gassed up if it thinks it's stoppin' me
i'ma be what i set out to be, without a doubt, undoubtedly
and all those who look down on me, i'm tearin' down your balcony
no ifs, ands or buts, don't try to ask him why or how can he
from infinite down to the last relapse album
he's still shittin' whether he's on salary, paid hourly
until he bows out or he shits his bowels out of him
whichever comes first, for better or worse
he's married to the game
like a "fuck you" for christmas, his gift is a curse
forget the earth, he's got the urge to pull his dick from the dirt
and fuck the whole universe


i'm not afraid, i'm not afraid
to take a stand, to take a stand
everybody, everybody
come take my hand, come take my hand
we'll walk this road together, through the storm
whatever weather, cold or warm
just lettin' you know that you're not alone
holla if you feel like you've been down the same road


okay, quit playin' with the scissors and shit, and cut the crap
i shouldn't have to rhyme these words in a rhythm for you to know it's a wrap
you said you was king, you lied through your teeth
for that, fuck your feelings, instead of gettin' crowned, you're gettin' capped
and to the fans, i'll never let you down again, i'm back
i promise to never go back on that promise
in fact, let's be honest, that last relapse cd was "ehh"
perhaps i ran them accents into the ground
relax, i ain't goin' back to that now
all i'm tryna say is get back, click-clack-blaow!
'cause i ain't playin' around
there's a game called circle and i don't know how
i'm way too up to back down
but i think i'm still tryna figure this crap out
thought i had it mapped out, but i guess i didn't
this fuckin' black cloud still follows me around
but it's time to exorcise these demons
these ma'fuckers are doin' jumpin' jacks now


i'm not afraid, i'm not afraid
to take a stand, to take a stand
everybody, everybody
come take my hand, come take my hand
we'll walk this road together, through the storm
whatever weather, cold or warm
just lettin' you know that you're not alone
holla if you feel like you've been down the same road


and i just can't keep livin' this way
so startin' today
i'm breakin' out of this cage
i'm standin' up, i'ma face my demons
i'm mannin' up, i'ma hold my ground
i've had enough, now i'm so fed up
time to put my life back together right now


it was my decision to get clean, i did it for me
admittedly i probably did it subliminally for you
so i could come back a brand-new me, you helped see me through
and don't even realize what you did, believe me, you
i've been through the wringer
but they can do little to the middle finger
i think i got a tear in my eye, i feel like the king of
my world, haters can make like bees with no stingers
and drop dead: no more beef lingers
no more drama from now on
i promise to focus solely on handlin' my responsibilities as a father
so i solemnly swear to always treat this roof like my daughters and raise it
you couldn't lift a single shingle on it
'cause the way i feel, i'm strong enough to go to the club
or the corner pub and lift the whole liquor counter up
'cause i'm raisin' the bar, i'd shoot for the moon
but i'm too busy gazin' at stars, i feel amazin', and


i'm not afraid, i'm not afraid
to take a stand, to take a stand
everybody, everybody
come take my hand, come take my hand
we'll walk this road together, through the storm
whatever weather, cold or warm
just lettin' you know that you're not alone
holla if you feel like you've been down the same road

uh, uh, uh, play that shit
what the fuck you doing stretch
gotta stretch your neck
you better protect it
i’mma inspectah deck

you won’t spit it on this mother friggen mic
cause i will strike and smack your ass like a friggen fag
and i don’t care if you get offended
i never pretended to rock this microphone beef
you wanna start it now we’ll end it
cause when i slip in the zone up on this microphone
people want me to do a written rap but fuck that go home
i don’t really give a damn i’ll kick right off of the top
and everything that i drop always gonna remain hot
let on the spot, slim, i mean woops, grim it’s when im dim
yo, i’m in affect mode
rappers get they neck sewed

get they damn fleshed sewed
ha, ha
i busted, i kill it, i crush it, i do it, the fluid, i spill it, i’m ill wit
these motherfucking rhymes that i be coming with and running with and kick you in yo motherfucking stomach with bitch
cause you don’t want none of it
rappers always try but they always die
and rappers always look to me and tried to lie
(arf, arf)
yo, where my dogs at
yo (err, ribbit) where my frogs at
in the house, it really doesn’t matter cause i still turn it out
when i step on this mic, smacking your spouse
ha, ha
the illest mc to come off the top
when i get this drum off
yo strech give me a break, let me catch my friggen breath
and till` the death, bust rhymes till` there’s none left
i’m wanted for theft and robbery
and probably smack a bitch up in the lobby g
cause she don’t want none of me
i’m the illest mc to ever hold a cordless on the planet earth and you’ll see
that i’m from the friggen d
ya’ll don’t get my point i’m from detroit
smoke your fake ass like a joint
that’s the first simplest rhyme i ever said in my life
but, at the end of the night i’ll still be fucking your wife
shit, i really don’t care your style needs to switch
cause you ain’t rich, that’s why you ain’t rich
remain underground, can’t come off the top
you can’t drop rhymes nonstop like this
i might twist my friggen dick up in your ear
rappers always wanna stand clear
i’m a motherfucking landmine
ya’ll don’t understand mine
i’m slim shady showing out like my tan line
ha, ha
the illest mc to rhyme
every time the illest mc of our time
i rhyme time and time twice but i’m nice
with this mic device i slice right through your adams apple
i had a snapple and a motherfriggen syringe
up in the bathroom i shouldn’t have but yo i boinked
to any mc up in this shit who want some
to any mc who wanna step up and get some
get done, fuck competition
let me catch my breath one more time
yo, i’m on a mission
to stomp any mc comp i just trunked
and swamp is this truamp a word?, no its not
yo, but here i go with this lyrical, lyricols, spiritual flows, that i flow so hysterical
driving mc’s crazy, slim shady, up in your motherfucking radio baby

(haha, yeah, haha)
you know, critics, man
critics never got nothin' nice to say, man
you know, the one thing i notice about critics, man
is critics never ask me how my day went
well, i'ma tell 'em


augh, yesterday my dog died
i hog tied a ho, tied her in a bow
said: "next time you blog, try to spit a flow."
you wanna criticize, dog? try a little mo'
i'm so tired of this i could blow, fire in the hole
i'm fired up, so fire up the lighter and the dro
better hold on a little tighter, here i go
flows tighter, hot-headed as ghost rider
cold-hearted as spider-man throwing a spider in the snow
so you better get lower than flo rida
inside of a lowrider with no tires, in a hole
why am i like this? why is winter cold?
why is it when i talk i'm so biased to the hoes?
listen, dog, christmas is off, this is as soft as it gets
this isn't golf, this is a blistering assault
those are your wounds, this is the salt, so get lost
shit, dissin' me is just like pissin' off the wizard of oz
wrap a lizard in gauze
beat you in the jaws with it, grab the scissors and saws
and cut out your livers, gizzards, and balls
throw you in the middle of the ocean in a blizzard with jaws
so sip piss like sizzurp through a straw
then describe how it tasted like dessert to us all
got the gall to make chris piss in his drawers
tickle him, go to his grave, skip him, and visit his dog


(you're on fire)
that's how you know you're on a roll
'cause when you're hot it's like you're burning up everyone else's cold
(you're on fire)
man, i'm so fuckin' sick
i got ambulances pullin' me over and shit
(you're on fire)
you need to stop, drop, and roll
'cause when you say the shit to get the whole hip-hop shop to blow
(you're on fire) yeah
(you're on fire) yuh


i just put a bullshit hook in between two long-ass verses
if you mistook this for a song, look, this ain't a song
it's a warning to brooke hogan and david cook
that the crook just took over, so book
run as fast as you can, stop writing and kill it
i'm lightning in a skillet, you're a fuckin' flash in the pan
i pop up, you bitches scatter like hot grease splashing a fan
mr. mathers is the man, yeah, i'm pissed
but i would rather take this energy and stash it in a can
come back and whip your ass with it again
saliva's like sulfuric acid in your hand
it'll eat through anything, metal, the ass of iron man
turn him into plastic
so for you to think that you could stand a fuckin' chance is asinine
yeah, ask denaun, man
hit a blind man with a coloring book
and told him color inside the lines or get hit with a flying crayon
fuck it, i ain't playin', pull up in a van
and hop out on a homeless man holding a sign sayin'
"vietnam vet", i'm out my fuckin' mind, man
kick over the can, beat his ass, and leave him nine grand
so if i seem a little mean to you
this ain't savage, you ain't never seen a brute
you wanna get graphic, we can go the scenic route
you couldn't make a bulimic puke
on a piece of fuckin' corn and peanut poop
sayin' you sick, quit playin', you prick, don't nobody care
and why the fuck am i yellin' at air?
i ain't even talkin' to no one, 'cause ain't nobody there
and nobody will fuckin' test me
'cause these hoes won't even dare
i'm wasting punchlines, but i got so many to spare
i just thought of another one that might go here
nah, don't waste it, save it, psycho—yeah
plus you got to rewrite those lines
that you said about michael's hair (whoops!)


(you're on fire)
that's how you know you're on a roll
'cause when you're hot it's like you're burning up everyone else's cold
(you're on fire)
man, i'm so- i'm so hot
my motherfuckin' firetruck's on fire, homie
(you're on fire)
you need to stop, drop, and roll
'cause when you say the shit to get the whole hip-hop shop to blow
(you're on fire) yeah
oh, shit (you're on fire)

aw, man, yeah
you ever be in the club, man
you get in a fight
and people that you don't even know jump in?


you feel, like you wanna hit somethin', your fist clenches, you're pissed
you just wanna get someone with shit, jump on this
you're 'bout to get your shit pushed in, i'm just inches away
from splittin' your shit wide open, no stitches can save
you'll die with your eyes open, you hope this isn't the way
you end up going out, but i guess it just is, i'm afraid
razors, scissors, and blades make jason say, “isn't this great?”
on-lookers participate in this ass-kicking debate
that's startin' to take place in the middle of the street
little did you know there'd be an all-out brawl, soon as you heard this beat
emergency personnel rush to the murder scene
but it's too late, it's absolute pandemonium, whisked away
in an ambulance is your fate, nothing nobody told you
when you left the house today could've made you anticipate
such an ass-whipping, okay, 'til the anger dissipates
you'll get punched in the face, reciprocate, come on!


so, what the deal, ridaz?
would you excuse me, while i feel my nuts?
my balls are feeling a mighty big now
i might just have to dig down and pull 'em through my britches
i said, “so, what the deal, ridaz?
would you excuse me, while i feel my nuts?
my balls are feeling a mighty big now
i might just have to dig down and pull 'em through my britches”


you step in the place with enough misplaced anger to catch a case
anxious to get in some shit, got your gangstas all with your ladies
you better go get your mace 'cause shady said so
you may wanna pick up the radio and bang it against your face
that's how fuckin' rowdy you feel, now do you still wanna grill?
if you don't wanna get the shit beat out of you, chill
'cause if you doubt me, you will, yeah, got me a pill, found me a thrill
i got a couple of drinks here, and i'm bound to refill
girl, howdy, how do you feel, ma?
this cocksucker did not spill my drink, oh, hell nah
he must be trying to kill my buzz
i will not budge, so what the deal, ridaz?
now here they all come, and they got your back in, like, two seconds flat
and that's probably a record, yeah, you wasn't expecting that
'cause they want in on the act, there's a cognac bottle
we snuck it in 'cause the beer that they was serving here was only tap
i'm bitin', i fight dirty, you might get kicked in the nuts
you're frightened, like, “this guy might hurt me”
you're quite certain he's nuts, i've hit myself in the face harder
play smarter, you may start her over, you need a chainsaw to
dig your way out or go powder your nose, pussy
the louder you yell, the harder i slap the shit outta you hoes
you set it off, faggot, so now how do you 'spose
we settle it? hit me in the nose, we'll see, how it goes


so, what the deal, ridaz?
would you excuse me, while i feel my nuts?
my balls are feeling a mighty big now
i might just have to dig down and pull 'em through my britches
i said, “so, what the deal, ridaz?
would you excuse me, while i feel my nuts?
my balls are feeling a mighty big now
i might just have to dig down and pull 'em through my britches”


it's sheer hustle, i bob, weave, deflate your beer muscles
we're tusslin', the crowd's startin' to cheer us, and
adrenaline's rushin' through us just like a geyser gushin'
too much budweiser in my blood, i'm stranglin' your windpipe for nothin'
my signature's ligature marks, look at you all
big with your remarks 'til i swing an icepick at your heart
at least that's what it feels, like when i pick ya apart
and dig at ya, and break you down like the bitch that you are
the predicament starts, when i throw a brick at your car
the pain inflicted upon you is so sick, it's bizarre
shit, this is almost ridiculous, addictive as far
as havin' me wanna rip out your fricking ligaments, arr!
you hit like a bitch, you scratch me with your nails for that
you catch an open hand slap, like a female like bap
in fact, i'll have the crowd smackin' you themselves
where's d12? i don't feel like doing this by myself, come on!


so, what the deal ridaz?
would you excuse me, while i feel my nuts?
my balls are feeling a mighty big now
i might just have to dig down and pull 'em through my britches
i said, “so, what the deal, ridaz?
would you excuse me, while i feel my nuts?
my balls are feeling a mighty big now
i might just have to dig down and pull 'em through my britches”


yeah, what the deal?
i'm feeling hard as hell right now, homie
i almost feel
invincible and shit
ayy, dre
you got me feelin' like
i can't be touched right now, fool, ha-ha!
i'm unstoppable, damn

like a verbal seduction when
seduction when i tell 'em girls on the floor
i don't know, man (geh-geh-geh)
just feels like we're a lot different (right now)
(girls on the floor) it kinda feels like (like a verbal seduction when)
i'm on a whole different page right now than you (girls on the floor)
it feels strange, but umm (girls on the floor)
i guess it's kinda like, it's kinda like...


i feel like i'm morphin' into somethin' that's so incredible
that i'm dwarfin' all competitors
better get your girlfriend in check
it's psychological warfare, endorphins i effect
your self-esteem shatters as dialect comes blastin' out your deck
she loves me, such passion, you'd expect
this sort of reaction from her, yet you strong-arm
you're fuckin' corny, you try to turn your charm on
'cause you just think you're bishop the don juan
but if you think that you're fuckin' with me, homie, you're on one
i'm cockin' my head back like ed lover, "c'mon, son!"
she's on my johnson, she brings my name up constant
your boys are like, "she's fuckin' with dude, she wants some"
homeboy, you better get a clue
she's on my dick 'cause i spit better than you
what you expect her to do?
how you expect her to act in the sack when she's closin' her eyes
fantasizin' of diggin' her nails in my back to this track?


seduction, seduce
ain't nobody who's as good at what i do
(it's like a verbal seduction when)
'cause one minute she loves you, the next she don't
she's been stolen from you
(it's like a verbal seduction when)
seduction, seduce
ain't nobody who's as good at what i do
'cause one minute she loves you, the next she don't
she's been stolen from you
(it's like a verbal seduction when)


she's sittin' there gettin' liquored up at the bar
she says it's quicker to count the things that ain't wrong with you
than to count the things that are
there's a seven-disc cd changer in her car
and i'm in every single slot, and you're not — aww!
i'm the logo on that dallas cowboy helmet: a star
and i'm not about to sit back
and just keep rhymin' one syllable — naw!
switch it up and watch them haters not give it up
'cause they're just not good enough, but i'm not givin' up
'til i get my respect and i won't stop 'til i get enough
'cause i'm not livin' up to my own expectations (aww!)
that hater alarm is soundin' off
and obama took the bomb from my name (aww!)
so quit cryin' that i took your dame, homie, she's my dame (aww!)
you sadly mistaken if you thinkin' that i'm not on my game, boy
and things just ain't been the same since the day that i came forth
you wear your heart on your sleeve, i sport that white tank, boy
but you got a hard-on for me, what you hollerin' my name for?
it's your bitch on my dick, ain't my dang fault, man, i can't call it


seduction, seduce
ain't nobody who's as good at what i do

it's like we're playin' lyrical tug of war with your ear
you hear it, girl? come here
put your ear up to the speaker, dear
while i freak this world premiere
seducin' her, loosen up
with a little freestyle that'll— wait, am i losin' ya?
am i makin' you look bad? well, i got news for ya
homie, you losin' her
oh wait, she don't like when i spit it fast
am i tryin' to show how? let me slow it down some
it's still gonna be a blow-out
you're gonna wanna throw out your whole album
rummage through the shit and try to salvage somethin' to see
if you can save any of it, punk, but none of it's fuckin' with me
prick, you really feelin' that bullshit?
you think you killin' them syllables? quit
playin', these beats ain't nothin' to fool with
they call me fire marshall: i shut the shit down
your entire arsenal is not enough to fuck with one round
i am also the opposite of what you are like
you're a microcosm of what the fuck i am on the mic
i am awesome and you are just awe-struck
she's love-stricken, she's got her jaw stuck
from suckin' my dick... aw, fuck


seduction, seduce
ain't nobody who's as good at what i do

(i guarantee i'll be the greatest thing you ever had)
you see, i'm not as crazy as you thought i was, am i?
('cause you ain't never met nobody like me
and you ain't gonna wanna fuck nobody else again)


i'm the american dream
i'm the definition of white trash ballin', i'm right back on 'em

same shit, different toilet, oh, you got a nice ass, darling

what you mean we ain't fuckin'? you take me for a friend?
let me tell you the whole story of shady's origin
you'll be sorry if you slam my mercedes door again
now, it all started with my father
i must've got my pimpin' genes from him the way he left my momma
i'm a rolling stone, just like him, word to johnny drama

but you may wanna find somethin' more stable
i told you i ain't foolin' from the gate, this ain't the first day of april
but thank you for stayin', april, i'ma make you
learn to appreciate me, differentiate me
from these phony, little fishy and sissy fake gs
skip over the "huggy bear," and all the "kissy face," please
initiate phase three, missy, now service me
take another shot of jäger, shake it so nervously
take your time, baby, ooh, you're the bomb, baby
ooh, you're doing that even better than your mom, lady
i told you why i'm shady, you didn't listen now, did ya?
relax, woman, you know that i'm only kiddin' wit' ya

dr. dre
2010
lightyears ahead of you (haha)
woo!

we touch, i feel a rush
we clutch, it isn't much
but it's enough to make me wonder what's in store for us
it's lust, it's torturous
you must be a sorceress
'cause you just did the impossible, gained my trust
don't play games, it'll be dangerous if you fuck me over
'cause if i get burnt, i'ma show you what it's like to hurt
'cause i been treated like dirt before ya
and love is evil, spell it backwards, i'll show ya
nobody knows me, i'm cold
walk down this road all alone
it's no one's fault but my own
it's the path i've chosen to go
frozen as snow, i show no emotion whatsoever, so
don't ask me why i have no love for these motherfuckin' hoes
bloodsuckin' succubuses, what the fuck is up with this?
i've tried in this department, but i ain't had no luck with this
it sucks, but it's exactly what i thought it would be like tryin' to start over
i got a hole in my heart, but some kind of emotional roller coaster
somethin' i won't go on, so you toy with my emotions, so it's over
it's like an explosion every time i hold ya
wasn't jokin' when i told you you take my breath away
you're a supernova and i'm a


i'll do whatever it takes
when i'm with you, i get the shakes
my body aches when i ain't with you, i have zero strength
there's no limit on how far i would go, no boundaries, no lengths
why do we say that until we get that person that we think's gonna be that one?
and then once we get 'em, it's never the same
you want 'em when they don't want you
soon as they do, feelings change
it's not a contest and i ain't on no conquest for no mate
i wasn't lookin' when i stumbled onto you, musta been fate
but so much is at stake, what the fuck does it take?
let's cut to the chase 'fore the door shuts in your face
promise me if i cave in and break and leave myself open
that i won't be makin' a mistake 'cause i'm a


so after a year and six months, it's no longer me that you want
but i love you so much it hurts, never mistreated you once
i poured my heart out to you, let down my guard, swear to god
i'll blow my brains in your lap, lay here and die in your arms
drop to my knees and i'm pleadin', i'm tryna stop you from leavin'
you won't even listen, so fuck it, i'm tryna stop you from breathin'
i put both hands on your throat, i sit on top of you, squeezin'
'til i snap your neck like a popsicle stick, ain't no possible reason
i can think of to let you walk up out this house and let you live
tears stream down both of my cheeks, now i let you go and just give
and 'fore i put that gun to my temple, i told you this


and i woulda done anything for you
to show you how much i adored you
but it's over now, it's too late to save our love
just promise me you'll think of me
every time you look up in the sky and see a star 'cause i'm a



ayo, before i start this song, man
i just wanna thank everybody for being so patient
and bearing with me over these last couple of years
while i figure this shit out


is anybody out there?
it feels like i'm talkin' to myself
no one seems to know my struggle
and everything i've come from
can anybody hear me?
yeah, i guess i keep talkin' to myself
it feels like i'm goin' insane
am i the one who's crazy?
yeah, woah-woah, woah-woah
woah-woah, woah-woah, woah-woah
so why in the world do i feel so alone?
nobody but me, i'm on my own
is there anyone out there who feels the way i feel?
if there is, then lend me an ear
just so i know that i'm not the only one


i went away, i guess, and opened up some lanes
but there was no one who even knew i was goin' through growin' pains
hatred was flowin' through my veins, on the verge of goin' insane
i almost made a song dissin' lil wayne
it's like i was jealous of him 'cause of the attention he was gettin'
i felt horrible about myself, he was spittin'
and i wasn't, anyone who was buzzin' back then coulda got it
almost went at kanye too, god, it
feels like i'm goin' psychotic, thank god that i didn't do it
i'da had my ass handed to me, and i knew it
but proof wasn't here to see me through it
i'm in the booth, poppin' another pill, tryna talk myself into it
"are you stupid? you're gon' start dissin' people for no reason?
'specially when you can't even write a decent punchline even? you're lyin' to yourself
you're slowly dyin', you're denyin', your health
is declinin' with your self-esteem, you're cryin' out for help"


is anybody out there?
it feels like i'm talkin' to myself
no one seems to know my struggle
and everything i've come from
can anybody hear me?
yeah, i guess i keep talkin' to myself
it feels like i'm goin' insane
am i the one who's crazy?
yeah
so why in the world do i feel so alone?
nobody but me, i'm on my own
is there anyone out there who feels the way i feel?
if there is, then lend me an ear
just so i know that i'm not the only one


marshall, you're no longer the man, that's a bitter pill to swallow
all i know is i'm wallowing, self-loathing and hollow
bottoms up on the pill bottle
maybe i'll hit my bottom tomorrow
my sorrow echoes in this hall though (oh-oh, oh)
but i must be talkin' to the wall though, i don't see nobody else
(i guess i keep talkin' to myself)
but all these other rappers suck is all that i know
i've turned into a hater, i put up a false bravado
but marshall is not an egomaniac, that's not his motto
he's not a desperado, he's desperate
his thoughts are bottled inside him
one foot on the brake, one on the throttle
fallin' asleep with writer's block in the parkin' lot of mcdonald's
but instead of feeling sorry for yourself, do something 'bout it
admit you got a problem, your brain is clouded
you pouted long enough
it isn't them, it's you, you fuckin' baby!
quit worryin' 'bout what they do, and do shady
i'm fuckin' goin' crazy


is anybody out there?
it feels like i'm talkin' to myself
no one seems to know my struggle
and everything i've come from
can anybody hear me?
yeah, i guess i keep talkin' to myself
it feels like i'm goin' insane
am i the one who's crazy?
yeah
so why in the world do i feel so alone?
nobody but me, i'm on my own
is there anyone out there who feels the way i feel?
if there is, then lend me an ear
just so i know that i'm not the only one


so i picked myself up off the ground
and fuckin' swam 'fore i drowned
hit my bottom so hard i bounced twice, suffice, this time around
it's different, them last two albums didn't count
encore, i was on drugs; relapse, i was flushin' 'em out
i've come to make it up to you now, no more fuckin' around
i got somethin' to prove to fans, 'cause i feel like i let 'em down
so please accept my apology, i finally feel like i'm back to normal
i feel like me again, let me formally
reintroduce myself to you for those of you who don't know
the new me's back to the old me
and homie, i don't show no signs of slowin' up
oh, and i'm blowin' up all over
my life is no longer a movie, but the show ain't over, homos
i'm back with a vengeance, homie
weezy, keep ya head up, t.i., keep ya head up
kanye, keep ya head up, don't let up
just keep slayin' them, rest in peace to dj am
'cause i know what it's like
i struggle with this shit every single day, and um…


is anybody out there?
it feels like i'm talkin' to myself
no one seems to know my struggle
and everything i've come from
can anybody hear me?
yeah, i guess i keep talkin' to myself
it feels like i'm goin' insane
am i the one who's crazy?
yeah
so why in the world do i feel so alone?
nobody but me, i'm on my own
is there anyone out there who feels the way i feel?
if there is, then lend me an ear
just so i know that i'm not the only one


so there it is, damn
feels like i just woke up or something
i guess i just forgot who the fuck i was, man
ayo, and to anybody i thought about going at
it was never nothing personal
it was just some shit i was going through
and to everybody else, i'm back! (i'm back!)
ha-ha (ha-ha)

you don't own me
nah, man—not quite finished yet
i'm not just one of your many toys
ha-ha, woo!


girl, i think you just might've tried to pull a motherfuckin' fast one, i'm mad
you just hurt my goddamn feeling and that was the last one i had
does this look like an arcade? tryna play games? see this saw blade?
see this silhouette of a stalker in your walkway? better cooperate
or get sauteed and rotisseried while you're hog-tied
mc's get so quiet you can hear a motherfuckin' dog whistle when i walk by
colt seavers on a mule, stuntin' on that ass like the fuckin' fall guy
i don't gas my mercedes after midnight, i treat it like a mogwai
'cause it will turn into a gremlin and run over kids, women, and men
vrinn-vrinn!—motor so big, you can fit a midget in his engine
bitch, give me them digits, why you cringin'? not by the hair on my chinny-chin-chin
will i spend-spend even ten cents on you, since when
do you think it's gonna cost me a pretty penny? shit, if i think a penny's pretty
just imagine how beautiful a quarter is to me; eenie-meenie-miney-mo
catch an eskimo by his toe while he's tryna roll a snowball (you don't own me)
but don't make him lose his cool, if he hollers, better let him go, y'all (i'm not just one of your many toys)
'cause


you don't own me
now here we go, go, go


get up, baby, get a move on like a u-haul, you can rack your brain
like pool balls; you won't ever think of this shit—yeah, honey, you called?
well, here i come, havoc on the beat, i wreak it; evil—i see
hear, and speak it—lady, put your money on shady, fuck that other weak shit
put your eggs in the same basket, you can count every motherfuckin'
chicken 'fore it hatches 'cause you can bet your ass that we gonna get it crackin'
like the kraken and titans when they're clashin', get your brains bashed in
so bad, you will have kurt cobain askin' to autograph a bloodstained napkin
unfashionable, and 'bout as rational as a rash on a fag's asshole
now let's take that line, run it up the flagpole
with elton, see if he's cool with it, don't stand there and look stupid
at me, bitch, i ain't in the mood for this shit, get my dick, google it
'til it pops up! y'all are so motherfuckin' full of shit that you're stocked up
me, i'm always shittin' diarrhea of the mouth 'til your speakers crap out (*fart*) huh, what?
girl, you got a hot butt like a lit cigarette (chig-chigga-ret-ret)
but you won't get a hot fudge sundae from me so do not strut
my way, slut, because—


you don't own me
now here we go, go, go


and now that i got your panties in a bunch and your bowels in an uproar
i'ma show you why i came, so you stop askin' me, "what the fuck for?"
now look you little slut, cunt, whore, i know you want more
bitch, it's time to put the math back into mathers 'cause i'm a fuckin' problem—run, boy!
every flow, got it mastered so every last word that you fuckin' fags heard
comes straight from the fish's ass, yeah, in other words, i'm a bass-turd
lookin' at me like i killed kenny, gas in the tank—yeah, still plenty
no morals are instilled in me, so remorse, i really don't feel any
eat your heart out, hannibal, understandable why you're jealous
fuck an animal, i got cannibal magnetism, can't resist him now—can you, hoe?
“shady, i don't understand your flow” — understand my flow? bitch, i flow
like troy polamalu's hair, boy, don't you dare try to follow or compare, boy
i'm raw, you ain't even medium-rare, stay the fuck outta my hair, boy
you can look, you can stare, and point, but you can't touch, i'm too clairvoyant
i don't get it, man, is there a void? all this weak shit, what am i, steroids?
well, bitch, i'm back with some shit for that ass and your trunk, elephant hemorrhoids
and remember, boys—


you don't own me
now here we go, go, go

cadillac sevilles, coupe devilles

shootin' from the hip, yeah, boy, i shoot to kill
half a breath left on my deathbed
screamin', “f that!” – yeah, super-ill
baby, what the deal? we can chill
split a half a pill and a happy meal
fuck a steak, slut, i'll cut my toes off
and step on the receipt 'fore i foot the bill
listen, garden tool, don't make me introduce you
to my power tool, you know the fuckin' drill
how you douchebags feel knowin' you're disposable?
summer's eve, massengill
shady's got the mass appeal
baby, crank the shit, 'cause it's your goddamn jam
you said that you want your punchlines a little more compact
well, shorty, i'm that man
these other cats ain't metaphorically where i'm at, man
i gave bruce wayne a valium
and said, “settle your fuckin' ass down!
i'm ready for combat, man!”
get it? calm batman, nah
ain't nobody who's as bomb and as nuts
lines are like mom's cat-scans
'cause they fuckin' go bananas
honey, i applaud that ass
swear to god, man, these broads can't dance
ma, show 'em how it's done
spaz like a goddamn taz, yeah


girl, shake that ass like a donkey with parkinson's
make like michael j. fox is in your drawers
playin' with an etch-a-sketch
bet you that you'll never guess
who's knockin' at your door, people hit the floors
yeah, tonight, ladies, you gon' get divorced
girl, forget remorse, i'ma hit you broads
with chris's force like you pissed him off
talented with the tongue, ma'fucker
you ain't got a lick in yours
hittin' licks like i'm robbin' liquor stores
makin' cash registers shit their drawers
think you spit the rawest?
i'm an uncooked slab of beef layin' on your kitchen floor
other words, i'm off the meat rack
bring the beat back, bring in two extension cords
i'ma measure my dick—shit, i need six inches more
fuck, my dick's big, bitch, need i remind you
that i don't need the fuckin' swine flu to be a sick pig?
you're addicted, i'm dope
i'm the longest needle around here—need a fix, ock?
i'm the big shot—get it, dick-snots?
you're just small pokes, little pricks
girl, you think that other prick's hot?
i'll drink gasoline and eat a lit match
before i sit back and let him get hotter
better call the cops on him quick, fast
shady's right back on your bitch-ass
white trash with a half a six-pack in his hatchback
trailer hitch attached to the back, dispatch


bitch, am i the reason that your boyfriend stopped rappin'?
does a bird chirp? does lil' wayne slurp 'zurp
'til he burps and smoke purp?
does a word search get circles wrapped around it
like you do when i come through?
i'd like you to remind yourself of what the fuck i can do
when i'm on the mic
oh, you're the kind of girl that i could take a likin' to
psych! i'm spikin' you like a football
been this way since i stood a foot tall
you're a good catch with a shitty spouse
got a pretty mouth and a good jaw
give me good brain, watch the wood-grain
don't want no cum stain—bitch, you listenin'?
tryin' to turn me down, slut, i'm talkin' to you
turn me back up! are you insane?!
tryin' to talk over me in the car
shut the fuck up while my shit's playin'!
i'm a shit stain on the underwear of life
what's the saying? where there's thunder, there is lightning
and they say that it never strikes twice in the same place
then how the fuck have i been hit six times
in three different locations on four separate occasions?
and you can bet your stankin' ass
that i've come to smash everything in my path
fork was in the road, took the psycho path
poison ivy wouldn't have me thinkin' rash
so hit the dance-floor, cutie, while i do my duty
on this microphone; shake your booty, shorty!
i'm the shit—why you think proof used to call me "doody"?



yeah!
oh!
get up! (where my trash at?)
i said, “get up!” (you know what happens when i'm around, man)
woo! let's go
better watch out now 'cause here we come
and we ain't stoppin', until we see the morning sun
so give us room to do our thing
'cause we ain't come to hurt no one
so e'rybody come and get up on the floor now and grab someone


man, first of all i'm a boss, i just want to get that across
man, even my dentist hates when i floss
pull up to the club in a pinto like it's a porsche
garbage bag for one of the windows
spray-painted doors with the flames on 'em
michigan plates, and my name's on 'em
baby, shady's here, come and get him if you dames want him
but he ain't stupid, so quit tryna run them games on him
he's immune to cupid, why you tryna put your claims on him?
'cause you won't do to me what you did to the last man
now climb in back, try not to kick over the gas can
there's a half a gallon in it, that could be our last chance
we have of just gettin' home, now can i get that lap dance?!
she's got a tattoo of me right above her ass, man
in the streets of warren, michigan, we call 'em 'tramp stamps'
that means she belongs to me, time to put the damn clamps down
and show this hussy who's the man — now get amped, dance!


now, you can do this on your own
but everyone knows that no one likes to be alone
so get on the floor and grab somebody
ain't nothin' but a white trash party! (white trash party!)
so, let's have us a little bash
and if anyone asks, it ain't no one but us trash
you don't know? you better ask somebody!
'cause we're havin' a white trash party! (white trash party!)


pull a fifth of bacardi from out of my underwear
and walk around the party without a care
like a body without a head
lookin' like a zombie from night of the living dead
and tomorrow, i'll probably still be too high to get out of bed
'til i feel like i been hit with the sharp part of the hammer
mixin' hennessy and fanta with pepto and mylanta (woo!)
i shoot the gift like i'm hollerin', “die, santa!”
missed the tree, and hit rudolph and two innocent bystanders (yeah!)
so quit tryna play the wall like you paul and
get on the floor when the beat drops and stop stallin'
they call me the stephon marbury of rap, darlin'
'cause as soon as they throw on some r. kelly, i start ballin'
makin' it rain for the ladies in the mini's
but i'm not throwin' 1's, 5's, 10's or even 20's
i'm throwin' quarters, nickels, dimes, pennies up at skinnies
man, i do this for them bunnies up at denny's
from the north, east and west—
but when it comes to them trailers in them south-parks
muffle it, 'cause, homie, that hood's tighter than kenny's
so ladies, if your belly button's not an innie, then i'm outtie
now hop in my minivan, let's get rowdy, come on!


now, you can do this on your own
but everyone knows that no one likes to be alone
so get on the floor and grab somebody!
ain't nothin' but a white trash party! (white trash party!)
so let's have us a little bash
and if anyone asks, it ain't no one but us trash
you don't know? you better ask somebody!
'cause we're havin' a white trash party! (white trash party!)


now, whether you're black, white, or purple
if you're misunderstood
but you don't give a fuck, you ain't doin' shit that you should
long as you know you're up to evil, and you're no damn good
get on the floor, man, and rep your hood


now, honey, don't let them pricks trip
we should make a quick dip
and go do some doughnuts in the hospital parking lot
'cause, girl, i got a sick whip
kick the back window out of my gremlin
put two milk crates in the trunk, rip out the stick shift
and make a 5-seater, i'll be damned if i feed a chick
it ain't like me to split a piece of dry pita
i be the s-l-to-the-i-m to the s-h-a-d-y
and i don't need a tank top to be a wife beater
i'll rip a tree out the ground and flip it upside down
'fore i turn over a new leaf, clown
i'll tell you now, i'm so raw, i still need to unthaw
you feel me, y'all? i shut the club down like drake in the mall
but, baby, a body like that's against the law
you the baddest little chain with the blades i ever saw
coleslaw containers, empty straw wrappers and all
you got more junk in your trunk than i do in my car
now get up!


now, you can do this on your own
but everyone knows that no one likes to be alone
so get on the floor and grab somebody!
ain't nothin' but a white trash party!
so let's have us a little bash
and if anyone asks, it ain't no one but us trash
you don't know? you better ask somebody!
'cause we're havin' a white trash party! (white trash party!)

the days are cold, livin' without you
the nights are long, i'm growin' older
i miss the days of old, thinkin' about you
you may be gone, but you're never over


if proof could see me now, i know he'd be proud
somewhere in me deep down, there's something in me he found
that made him believe in me, now no one can beat me now
you try, it'll be them doors on dre's phantom, believe me, clowns
that means "suicide," homie, you'll never throw me
off of this course, blow me! bitch, i do this all for the sport only
but i want it all, i'm not just talkin' awards, homie
and the ball's in my court and it's lonely
on top of the world, when you're the only one
with the balls in your shorts
to leave their jaws on the floors with no remorse
'member that when they get to doggin' you boy, homie
so y'all can just get to bloggin' about bologna
i'm not gonna stop, the saga continues, no stoppin' the force, obi
i'm moppin' the floors with 'em, i keep tryna pass it, but they keep on
droppin' the torch and it won't be long 'til this sport is o-v-
-e-r, just blaze and me, we are knockin' on doors and no, we
ain't pumpkins on halloween, but we'll show up on your porch, so be
careful what you say, there ain't no punks over here, so follow me
through the fog like i'm s-n-double-o-p, let me guide you through the smoke, g
if only i wasn't travelin' down this road by my lonely
no one who knew me like you will ever know me
i don't think you understand how much you meant to me


the days are cold, livin' without you
the nights are long, i'm growin' older
i miss the days of old, thinkin' about you
you may be gone, but you're never over


and it don't stop, oh-oh
and it don't quit, oh-oh
and it don't stop, oh-oh
and it don't quit, oh-oh
and i miss you, oh-oh
i just miss you, oh-oh
i just miss you, oh-oh
homie, i'll never forget you, no


for you i wanna write the sickest rhyme of my life
so sick it'll blow up the mic, it'll put the "dyna" in "mite"
yeah, it'll make the dopest mc wanna jump off a bridge and shit himself
tap dancin' all over the beat, it'll jump off the page and spit itself
guess that the best thing i can do right now, doody, for you is to rep
so i'm gonna fuck 'til i die, yeah, i'ma do it to death
and instead of mournin' your death, i'd rather celebrate your life
elevate to new heights, step on the gas and accelerate, i'ma need two mics
'cause the way that i'm feelin' tonight, everything i can just do right
there's nothin' that i can do wrong, i'm too strong and i'm just too hype
just finish the rhyme and i bust it, excuse the corny metaphor
but they'll never catch up to all this energy that i've mustered
so god, just help me out while i fight through this grievin' process
tryna process this loss is makin' me nauseous
but this depression ain't takin' me hostage, i've been patiently watchin'
this game, pacin' these hallways, you had faith in me always
proof, you knew i'd come out of this slump, rise from these ashes
come right back on their asses and go mike tyson on these bastards
and i'ma show 'em, blow 'em out the water, slaughter 'em, homes
i'ma own so many belts, only place they can hit me is below 'em
homie, i know i'm never gonna be the same without you
i never woulda came in this game, i'm goin' insane without you
matter fact, it was just the other night had another dream about you
you told me to get up, i got up, i spread my wings and i flew
you gave me a reason to fight, i was on my way to see you
you told me, "naw, doody, you're not!"; layin' on that table, i knew
i was gonna make it; soon as you said, "think of hailie" i knew
there wasn't no way that i was ever gonna leave them babies; and proof
not many are lucky enough to have a guardian angel like you
lord, i'm so thankful, please don't think that i don't feel grateful, i do
just grant me the strength that i need for one more day to get through
so, homie, this is your song, i dedicate this to you
i love you, doody


the days are cold, livin' without you
the nights are long, i'm growin' older
i miss the days of old, thinkin' about you
you may be gone, but you're never over


and it don't stop, oh-oh
and it don't quit, oh-oh
and it don't stop, oh-oh
and it don't quit, oh-oh
and i miss you, oh-oh
i just miss you, oh-oh
i just miss you, oh-oh
homie, i'll never forget you, no
