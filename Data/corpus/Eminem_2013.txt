came to the world at a time when it was in need of a villain
an asshole, that role i think i succeeded fulfillin'
but don't think i ever stopped
to think that i was speakin' to children
everything was happenin' so fast
it was like i blinked—sold three million
then it all went blank, all i remember is feelin' ridiculous
‘cause i was gettin' sick of this feelin'
like i'm always under attack, man
i could have stacked my shit list to the ceilin'
women dishin' but really thinkin': "if anyone ever talks to one of my little girls like this i would kill him."
guess i'm a little bit of a hypocrite when i'm rippin' shit
but since when did this many people ever give a shit
what i had to say? it's just my opinion
if it contradicts how i'm livin', put a dick in your rear end
that's why every time you mentioned a lyric
i thanked you for it, for drawin' more attention toward it
‘cause it gave me an enormous platform
i'm flattered you thought i was that important
but you can't ignore the fact that i fought for the respect
and battled for it, mad awards, had glaad annoyed
atta-boy, they told me to slow down, i'd just zone out
good luck tryin' to convince a blonde
it's like tellin' gwen stefani she sold out
‘cause i was tryna leave no doubt
in anyone's mind, one day i'd go down in history
think they know now because everybody knows


thanks for the support, asshole! *scratch*
thanks for the support, asshole!


quit actin' salty! i was countin' on you to count me out
ask asher roth when he roundabout
dissed me to shout me out
thought i was history, well goddamn, honky
that compliment's like backhandin' a donkey
good way to get your ass socked in the mouth
nah, i'm off him
but what the fuck's all this trash-talkin' about?
the fight was fixed, i'm back and you can't stop me
you knocked me down, i went down for the count
i fell, but the fans caught me, and now
you're gonna have to beat the fuckin' pants off me
to take my belt—word to pacquiao
momma said, "there ain't nothin' else to talk about
better go in that ring and knock 'em out
or you better not come out!"
it's poetry in motion
like freddie roach when he's quotin' shakespeare
so what if insults are revoltin'?
even helen keller knows life stinks
you think it's a joke 'til you're bullet-riddled
but you should give little shit what i think
this whole world is a mess
gotta have a goddamn vest on your chest
and a glock just to go watch batman
who needs to test a testicles? not that man
half of you don't got the guts, intestinal blockage
rest of you got lap bands
stuck to this motto 'fore they put bath salts
and all those water bottles in colorado, so get lost, waldo
my soul's escapin' through this asshole that is gapin'
a black hole and i'm swallowin' this track whole
better pack toilet paper, but i'm takin' no crap, ho
here i go down the bat pole
and i'm changin' back into that old maniac
in fact, there they go tryna dip out the back door retreatin'
‘cause everybody knows


holy mackerel! i'm the biggest jerk on the planet earth
i smacked a girl off the mechanical bull at a tractor pull
for thinkin' we had some magnetic pull
then screamed, "icp in this bitch! how do fuckin' magnets work?"
‘cause you're attractive, but we ain't attractable
hate to be dramatical, but i'm not romantical
i'm makin' up words so you can understandable, it's tragical
thinkin' some magical shit's gonna happen, that ain't practical
you crackin' a joke, it's laughable
‘cause me and love's like a bad combination
i keep them feelings locked in a vault
so it's safe to say i'm uncrackable
my heart is truly guarded, full body armor
bitch, you just need a helmet
‘cause if you think you're special, you're retarded
thinkin' you're one of a kind like you got some platinum vagina
you're a train wreck, i got a one-track mind
shorty, you're fine, but you sort of remind me of a 49er
‘cause you been a gold digger since you was a minor
been tryna hunt me down like a dog
‘cause you're on my ass but you can't get a cent
‘cause all of my spare time is spent
on my nose in this binder, so don't bother tryin'
only women that i love are my daughters
but sometimes i rhyme and it sounds like i forget i'm a father
and i push it farther
so, father, forgive me if i forget to draw the line
it's apparent i shouldn't have been a parent
i'll never grow up, so to hell with your parents
and motherfuck father time
it ain't never gonna stop, a pessimist
who transformed to an optimist in his prime
so even if i'm half-dead, i'm half-alive
poured my half-empty glass in a cup
now my cup has runneth over
and i'm 'bout to set it on you like a mothafuckin' coaster
i’m goin' back to what got me here
yeah, cocky, and can’t knock bein' rude off, so fear not, my dear
and dry up your teardrops, i'm here
white america's mirror, so don't feel awkward or weird
if you stare at me and see yourself because you're one too
shouldn't be a shock, because everybody knows



one thousand different houses and münchausen, i'ma make you
wanna punch out some-fuckin'-one: "ouch! what the fuck you hit me for?!"
screamed life as i punch counter, in bunches out of anger
i once encountered a stranger in a dumb gown
black hoodie with a scythe, shit, i laughed in his face, spit
bitch gave me an extra life, like, "take this!
now get your ass back in that game, bitch! don't take shit
for granted, and don't take shit, give it!"
only bull you should take is by the horns, a mixture of whitey ford
and mighty thor, i everlast, pen is mightier than sword
finish writin', then record, replenish, keep writin' more
nothing's ridin' on it but your pride, that's all you're fightin' for
so you fight, scratch, you claw, backs to wall, no one was there to catch you fall
you pick yourself back up, you dust your jacket off
you grab your balls like they're gargantuan and ask yourself how fuckin' bad you want it
pull out your badge for whoopin' ass and flash it on 'em
nobody's gonna back you in the corner, you're a hornet
no one's more ignorant than you fuckin' four in the mornin'
you're at the laboratory, stormin' like there's nothin' that's more important
emcees, you better consider this a formal warnin', you're in for it!
girl, what would you do if i said your body was off the chain
and i told you i smile every single time i saw your face?
i ain't finished, bitch, i meant "in half", oil the blades
nobody wants to play, they say i'm a spoiled lil' baby, but—


nobody puts baby in the corner
i'm only tryna warn ya
'cause that baby gets mad and gets to throwin' a tantrum
he'll fuckin' flip on ya
'cause nobody puts baby in the corner
i'm only tryna warn ya
'cause that baby gets mad and gets to throwin' a tantrum
he'll fuckin' flip on ya


what goes through an addict's brain besides static pain
and big daddy kane, breakbeats and words? an erratic train
of thought like splatter paint, scatter brain
yeah, maybe that explains why you're back but don't rap the same (yeah!)
and you're lookin' way thinner 'cause your hunger got you lookin' like
they took away dinner (chicka) "sugar ray" leonard
wouldn't sugar-coat a fuckin' booger though just to wipe that bitch on a hooker's coat
when you say you're a (chicka) what? (chicka) goat
now fling that bitch from your fingertips, hope it lands on
another rap singer's lips who can't think of shit anything of wit
that's interesting to spit, yo, who's king of this fuckin' english lit?
let your middle fingers flip on each hand while extendin' the shit
how low can you go? lower than chuck d, ho
hear the bassiness in my voice? rocky's back, where my adrian's?
nobody's crazy as shady in an eighty million mile radius
i'm what tom brady is to the patriots
to rap; i'm not a man, i'm a weapon who just happened
to be a rapper who just happen to be on the crapper
when it happened i had an epiphany in the bathroom
i'd never be the same after now i'm back with an appe-
-tite for destruction and a fuckin' recipe for disaster
so let's eat 'cause i'm famished, every deed is a dastardly
one, evilest bastard, even you askin' for me to be po-
-lite to people's like me havin' my teeth pulled


nobody puts baby in the corner
i'm only tryna warn ya
'cause that baby gets mad and gets to throwin' a tantrum
he'll fuckin' flip on ya
'cause nobody puts baby in the corner
i'm only tryna warn ya
'cause that baby gets mad and gets to throwin' a tantrum
he'll fuckin' flip on ya


so step inside a dimension demented side of a mind that's like
an inside of an engine while i multiply your undivided attention
but be reminded: if i didn't mention
i lose my mind and my temper you'll be the first one who finds him offensive
got him climbin' the fences, lost some time to addiction
but look up "rhyme" in the dictio-nary, i'm in the picture
"eminem" is the synonym for it, i'm an enigma
fuck it, let's get to the meatballs, i'm gonna skip the
veg and potatoes, edumacator (they are)
shit, legends are made of, spit treacherous data
shit that you would say to your worst enemy
this wretched is what you get when you mix treach with a jada
then combine 'em with method man and redman with metham-
-phetamines in each left hand, in each right is a sledgehammer
in pajamas, standin' in front of a webcam
beatin' themselves in the head 'til russell lets him off def jam
maybe i need my head exam-ed, hannibal lecter with a dead lamb
hangin' from his ceiling, drippin' with a bed pan
i need meds, swear to god 'cause if i go off the edge
t.i. ain't talkin' me off the ledge, man
heart-throb that'll fart, ah, nah
more like a smart slob, part blob that'll stab you with a sharp ob-
-ject to the heart and leave claw marks all over the wal-
-mart walls, little baby with large balls
fuck mud-slingin', i'm blood-flingin'
there's nothing on this fuckin' earth better than bein' the
king of the playground, i hate the swings, but i love bein'
an underdog 'cause when i'm pushed i end up swingin' (ah!)


nobody puts baby in the corner
i'm only tryna warn ya
'cause that baby gets mad and gets to throwin' a tantrum
he'll fuckin' flip on ya
'cause nobody puts baby in the corner
i'm only tryna warn ya
'cause that baby gets mad and gets to throwin' a tantrum
he'll fuckin' flip on ya

it's like i'm in the dirt, diggin' up old hurt
tried everything to get my mind off you, it won't work
all it takes is one song on the radio, you're
right back on it, reminding me all over again how you fuckin' just brushed me off and left me so burnt
spent a lot of time tryna soul search
maybe i needed to grow up a little first
well, looks like i hit a growth spurt
but i'm coming for closure
don't suppose an explanation i'm owed
for the way that you turned your back on me
just when i may have needed you most
oh, you thought it was over?
you could just close the
chapter and go about your life like it was nothing
you ruined mine, but you seem to be doing fine
well, i've never recovered
but tonight, bet you that what you're
'bout to go through's tougher than anything i ever have suffered
can't think of a better way to define poetic justice
can i hold grudges? mind saying, "let it go, fuck this!"
heart's saying, "i will, once i bury this bitch alive
hide the shovel and then drive off in the sunset"


and to think i used to think you was the shit, bitch
to think it was you at one time i worshipped? shit
think you can hurt people and just keep getting away with it?
not this time, you better go and get the sewing kit, bitch
finish this stitch, so you can reap what you sew, nitwit
thought some time would pass and i'd forget it? forget it
you left our family in shambles
you expect me to just get over him, pretend he never existed?
may be gone but he's not forgotten
and don't think 'cause he's been out the picture so long that i've stopped the plotting and still ain't coming to get ya
you're wrong and that shit was rotten
and the way you played him's same shit you did to me, cold
have you any idea the shit that i've gone through?
feelings i harbor? all this pent-up resentment i hold on to?
not once you call to ask me how i'm doing
letters, you don't respond to 'em
fuck it, i'm coming to see you
and gee, who better to talk to than you?
the cause of my problems
my life is garbage, and i'm 'bout to take it out on ya
poof, then i'm gone, voosh


i've been drivin' around your side of this town
like nine frickin' hours and forty-five minutes now
finally, i found your new address, park in your drive
feel like i've been waitin' on this moment all of my life
and it's now arrived and my mouth is full of saliva
my knife is out and i'm duckin' on the side of your house
see, it's sad it came to this point
such a disappointment i had to make this appointment
to come and see ya, but i ain't here for your empathy
i don't need your apology or your friendship or sympathy
it's revenge that i seek
so i sneak vengefully, and treat your bedroom window
like i reach my full potential—i peeked (haha)
continue to peep, still bent low, then keep
tapping the glass lightly then start to crescendo, sneak
all the way 'round to the back porch
man, door handles unlocked, shouldn't be that easy to do this
you don't plan for intruders beforehand?
surprised to see me? cat got your tongue?
gag, chloroform rag, dag, almost hack-up a lung
like you picked an axe up and swung, stick to the core plan
dragged to the back of a trunk by one of your fans
irony's spectacular, huh? now who's a faggot, you punk?
and here's your bronco hat, you can have that shit back 'cause they suck
it's just me, you, and the music now, slim, i hope you hear it
we're in a car right now—wait, here comes my favorite lyric
"i'm the bad guy who makes fun of people that die"
and hey, here's a sequel to my mathers lp just to try to get people to buy
how's this for a publicity stunt? this should be fun
last album now 'cause after this you'll be officially done
eminem killed by m and m, matthew mitchell
bitch, i even have your initials
i initially was gonna bury you next to my brother, but fuck it
since you're in love with your city so much, i figured, what the fuck, the best place you could be buried alive is right here
two more exits, time is quite near
hope we don't get stopped, no license i fear
that sirens i hear?
guess ninety on the freeway wasn't the brightest idea
as cops appear in my driver's side mirror
(oh, god! police! agh!)
hope foxtrot gets an aerial shot of your burial plot, at least
new plan, stan!
slim: "chauvinist pig drove in this big lincoln town car"
well, gotta go, almost at the bridge
ha ha, big bro, it's for you; slim, this is for him
and frank ocean; oh, hope you can swim good
now say you hate homos again!

part 2: produced by streetrunner

i also represent anyone on the receiving end of those jokes you offend
i'm the nightmare you fell asleep and then woke up still in
i'm your karma closin' in with each stroke of a pen
perfect time to have some remorse to show for your sin
nope, it's hopeless, i'm that denial that you're hopelessly in
when they say all of this is approaching its end
but you refuse to believe that it's over, here we go all over again
back's to the wall, i'm stackin' up all them odds
toilets clogged, yeah, 'cause i'm talkin' a lot of shit, but i'm backin' it all up
but in my head there's a voice in the back and it hollers
after the track is demolished
i am your lack of a conscience
i'm the ringing in your ears
i'm the polyps on the back of your tonsils
eating your vocal cords after your concerts
i'm your time that's almost up that you haven't acknowledged
grab for some water
but i'm that pill that's too jagged to swallow
i'm the bullies you hate that you became with every faggot you slaughtered comin' back on ya
every woman you insult, batter, but the double-standard you have when it comes to your daughters
i represent everything you take for granted
'cause marshall mathers, the rapper's persona
is half a facade, and matthew and stan's just symbolic
of you not knowin' what you had 'til it's gone
'cause after all the glitz and the glam
no more fans that are calling your name
cameras are off, sad, but it happens to all of them
i'm the hindsight to say, "i told you so!"
foreshadows of all the things that are to follow
i'm the future that's here to show you what happens tomorrow
if you don't stop after they call ya
biggest laughing stock of rap who can't call it quits
when it's time to walk away, i'm every guilt trip
the baggage you have, but as you gather up all your possessions
if there's anything you have left to say
'less it makes an impact then don't bother
so 'fore you rest your case better make sure you're packing a wallop (a wallop)


so, one last time, i'm back
'fore it fades into black and it's all over
behold the final chapter in a saga
tryna recapture that lightning trapped in a bottle
twice, the magic that started it all
tragic portrait of an artist tortured
trapped in his own drawings
tap into thoughts blacker and darker than anything imaginable;
here goes a wild stab in the dark
uh, as we pick up where the last mathers left off

i can feel the heat risin'
everything is on fire
today's a painful re-
minder of why
it can only get brighter
the further you put it behind ya
but right now i'm on the
inside lookin' out, ‘cause—


yesterday was the tornado warning, today's like the morning after
your world is torn in half, you wake in its wake
to start the mourning process and rebuilding, you're still a work in progress
today's a whole new chapter, it's like an enormous asthma
thunderstorm has passed ya, you weathered it and poked its
eye out with the thornbush that ya used to smell the roses
stopped to inhale, can't even tell your nose is stuffed
so focused on the bright side then you floor the gas pedal
and hit the corner faster, more assertive, never looking back
may hit the curb, but every day's a new learning curve as ya
steer through life, sometimes you might not wanna swerve but you have to
to avert a disaster, lucky no permanent damage
‘cause they hurt you so bad it's like they murdered your ass
and threw dirt on your casket, but you've returned from the ashes
and that hurt that you have, you just converted to gasoline
and while you're burning the past, standing at inferno and chantin'


you're so familiarized with what having to swallow this pill is like
it happens all the time, they take your heart and steal your life
and it's as though you feel you've died, 'cause you've been killed inside
but yet you're still alive, which means you will survive
although today you may weep ‘cause you're weak and
everything seems so bleak and hopeless, the light that you're seekin'
it begins to seep in, that's the only thing keepin'
you from leapin' off the motherfreakin' deep end
and i'm pullin' for you to push through this feeling
and with a little time that should do the healing and by tomorrow
you may even feel so good that you're willing to forgive 'em
even after all the shit you've been put through, this feeling of resilience is building
and the flames are burnin' quick as fire would through this building
you're sealed in, but you're fireproof, flame retardant, you withstood it
and as you climb up to the roof, you're just chillin', you look down, ‘cause you're so over 'em
you could put the heel of your foot through the ceiling


as time passes, things change every day
but wounds, wounds heal but scars still remaining the same
but tomorrow, today's going down in flames
throw the match, set the past ablaze


so feel the fire beneath your feet as you barely even
perspire from the heat, exhale deep and breathe a sigh of relief
and as you say goodbye to the grief, it's like watching the walls melt
in your prison cell, but you've extinguished this livin' hell
still, a little piece of you dies as you scream—



now this shit's about to kick off, this party looks wack
let's take it back to straight hip-hop and start it from scratch
i'm 'bout to bloody this track up, everybody get back
that's why my pen needs a pad, 'cause my rhymes on the rag
just like i did with addiction, i'm 'bout to kick it
like a magician, critics i turn to crickets
got 'em still on the fence whether to picket
but quick to get it impaled when i tell 'em, "stick it!"
so sick, i'm looking pale—wait, that's my pigment
'bout to go ham, ya bish, shout out to kendrick
let's bring it back to that vintage slim, bitch!
the art of mcing mixed with da vinci and mc ren
and i don't mean stimpy's friend, bitch
been public enemy since you thought pe was gym, bitch


kick your shoes off, let your hair down
(and go berserk) all night long
grow your beard out, just weird out
(and go berserk) all night long


we're gonna rock this house until we knock it down
so turn the volume loud
'cause it's mayhem 'til the a.m
so, baby, make just like k-fed
and let yourself go, let yourself go
say, "fuck it!" before we kick the bucket
life's too short to not go for broke
so everybody, everybody (go berserk)
grab your vial, yeah


guess it's just the way that i'm dressed, ain't it?
khakis pressed, nike shoes crispy and fresh laced
so i guess it ain't that aftershave
or cologne that made 'em just faint
plus i showed up with a coat fresher than wet paint
so if love is a chess game, check mate
but girl, your body's bangin', jump me in, dang, bang-bang
yes siree 'bob', i was thinking the same thang
so come get on this kid's rock, baw with da baw, dang-dang
pow-p-p-p-pow, chica, pow, chica, wow-wow
got your gal blowin' up a valve, v-v-valve-valve
ain't slowin' it down, throw in the towel, t-t-towel-towel
dumb it down, i don't know how, huh-huh, how-how
at least i know that i don't know
question is, are you bozos smart enough to feel stupid?
hope so, now ho


kick your shoes off, let your hair down
(and go berserk) all night long
grow your beard out, just weird out
(and go berserk) all night long


we're gonna rock this house until we knock it down
so turn the volume loud
'cause it's mayhem 'til the a.m
so crank the bass up like crazy
and let yourself go, let yourself go
say, "fuck it!" before we kick the bucket
life's too short to not go for broke
so everybody, everybody (go berzerk)
get your vinyls


and they say that love is powerful as cough syrup in styrofoam
all i know is i fell asleep and woke up in that monte carlo
with the ugly kardashian, lamar, oh
sorry, yo—we done both set the bar low
far as hard drugs are though, that's the past
but i done did enough codeine to knock future into tomorrow
and girl, i ain't got no money to borrow
but i am tryin' to find a way to get you alone: car note
oh, marshall mathers
shithead with a potty mouth, get the bar of soap lathered
kangol's and carheartless cargos
girl, you're fixin' to get your heart broke
don't be absurd, ma'am, you birdbrain, baby
i ain't called anybody baby since birdman, unless you're a swallow (ha-ha!)
word, rick? (word, man, you heard)
but don't get discouraged, girl
this is your jam, unless you got toe jam


kick your shoes off, let your hair down
(and go berserk) all night long
grow your beard out, just weird out
(and go berserk) all night long


we're gonna rock this house until we knock it down
so turn the volume loud
'cause it's mayhem 'til the a.m
so, baby, make just like k-fed
and let yourself go, let yourself go
say, "fuck it!" before we kick the bucket
life's too short to not go for broke
so everybody, everybody (go berserk)
grab your vial, yeah


we're gonna rock this house until we knock it down
so turn the volume loud
'cause it's mayhem 'til the a.m
so crank the bass up like crazy
and let yourself go, let yourself go
say, "fuck it!" before we kick the bucket
life's too short to not go for broke
so everybody, everybody (go berzerk)
get your vials

"or eminem has a full line of chainsaws
"eminem, eminem, eminem, eminem
eminem, eminem"
"marshall mathers, eminem, the rapper eminem"
"who can say for sure?
perhaps a frontal lobotomy would be the answer
if science could operate on this distorted brain
and put it to good use, society would reap a great benefit"


i walk around like a space cadet, place your bets
who's likely to become a serial killer? case of tourettes
fuck, fuck, fuck, can't take the stress
i make a mess as the day progresses
angry and take it out on the neighbors' hedges
like this is how i'll cut your face up, bitches, with these hedge-trimmin' scissors with razor edges
imagination's dangerous, it's the only way to escape this mess
and make the best of this situation, i guess
'cause i feel like a little bitch, this predicament's
despicable, i'm sick of just gettin' pushed, it's ridiculous
i look like a frickin' wuss, a pussy
this kid just took my stick of licorice
and threw my sticker books in a picker bush
i wanna kick his tush, but i was six and shook
this fucker was twelve and was six foot, with a vicious hook
he hit me, i fell, i got back up, all i did was book
now there's usin' your head, momma always said


"if you had a brain, you'd be dangerous
a brain, you'd be dangerous" (i'ma prove you wrong)
momma, i'ma grow one day to be famous
and i'ma be a pain in the anus (i'ma be the bomb)
i'ma use my head as a weapon
find a way to escape this insaneness (momma always said)
"son, if you had a brain, you'd be dangerous"
guess it pays to be brainless


fast forward some years later, a teenager; this is fun, sweet
i just got jumped twice in one week, it's complete
it's usually once a month, this is some feat i've accomplished
they've stomped me into the mud, gee
for what reason you stumped me?
but how do you get the shit beat out of you, beat down
and be upbeat when you don't have nothing?
no valid shot at life, chance to make it or succeed
'cause you're doomed from the start
it's like you grew up on jump street, from jump street
but if i could just get my head out my ass
i could accomplish any task, practicin' trash-talkin' in a trance
locked in my room, yeah, but i got some plans, momma
these damn rhymes are fallin' out of my pants pocket, i can't stop it!
and i'm startin' to blend in more, in school this shit helps for sure
i'm gettin' more self-assured than i've ever been before
plus no one picks on me anymore
i done put a stop to that, threw my first punch, end of story
still, in my skull’s a vacant empty void, been usin' it more as a bin for storage
take some inventory: in this gourd, there's a ford engine, door
hinge, syringe, an orange, an extension cord, and a ninja sword
not to mention four linchpins, an astringent stored
ironin' board, a bench, a wrench, a ore winch, an attention whore
everything but a brain, but dome's off the fuckin' chain
like an independent store, something's wrong with my head
just think if i had a brain in it, thank god that i don't
'cause i'd probably be dahmer, 'cause momma always said


"if you had a brain, you'd be dangerous
a brain, you'd be dangerous" (i'ma prove you wrong)
momma, i'ma grow one day to be famous
and i'ma be a pain in the anus (i'ma be the bomb)
i'ma use my head as a weapon
find a way to escape this insaneness (momma always said)
"son, if you had a brain, you'd be dangerous"
guess it pays to be brainless


now my mom goes wahm-wahm-wahm
'cause i'm not that smart, but i'm not dumb
i was on the bottom of the pile, gettin' stomped
but somehow i came out on top


i told you one day, i said they'd have that red carpet rolled out, yo
i'm nice, y'all, fuck it, i'm out cold, now everywhere i go
they scream out, "go!", i'm 'bout to clean house, yo
i'm lysol, now i'm just household
outsold the sell-outs, freak the hell out middle america
hear 'em yell out in terror, they were so scared, and those kids
just about belted out whatever spouted
or fell out my smart aleck mouth, it was so weird
inappropriate? so be it, i don't see it
maybe one day when the smoke clears, it won't be as
motherfuckin' difficult, yeah
'til then, hopefully you little homos get over your fears and phobias
it's okay to be scared straight, they said i provoke queers
'til emotions evoke tears, my whole career's
a stroke of sheer genius, smoke and mirrors, tactical, practical jokes, yeah
you motherfuckin'— insert insult here
who the fuck woulda thunk that one little ole mc'd
be able to take the whole culture and reupholster it?
and boy, they did flock; can't believe this little hick locked
this hip-hop shit in his hip pocket, and still the shit got
that white-trash traffic in gridlock, shit hoppin' like six blocks
from a kid rock/insane clown posse concert in mid-oc-
-tober, and god forbid i see a wizard
and get a brain in my titanium cranium, y'all
'cause i'll turn into the unabomber, momma always said—


"if you had a brain, you'd be dangerous
a brain, you'd be dangerous" (i'ma prove you wrong)
momma, i'ma grow one day to be famous
and i'ma be a pain in the anus (i'ma be the bomb)
i'ma use my head as a weapon
find a way to escape this insaneness (momma always said)
"son, if you had a brain, you'd be dangerous"
guess it pays to be brainless


"insaneness" ain't even a word, you stupid fuck!
neither is "ain't"

girl, you give me writer's block, i'm at a loss for words
uhh, my mind's as lost as yours
i rack my brain but still no thoughts emerge
never seen no ass as large as yours
how much that cost? that's what i call a roethlissplurge
you drive me bonkers, i’m about to get my swerve on for sure
thought i was pimpin' 'til i felt like nas, the first
date 'cause i think i gave you power
when i gave you flowers in a vase
a box of chocolates, throat lozengers, cough drops and certs
probably shoulda never let me call that job of yours
to talk to your boss and ask him if you can take off from work
shoulda been one of the first signs to cause alert
man, we jumped in too fast
'cause since then i just can't be apart from her
'cause nobody's body's awesomer
i lust her and she loves me 'cause i'm popular
but you know this ain't love


you know this ain't love, oh no (oh this ain't love)
you know this ain't love (oh this ain't love), oh no
what is it then?
it's desperation (she's looking for mr. right) (hey!)
(wants me to be that guy to her)
it's desperation (i can't even put up a fight) (hey!)
('cause i give in at the sight of her)
and i here i go again


you were obviously oblivious to me
i swore i was just invisible to you
'til i went to the lengths i did to meet you
'cause you played so hard to get with me from
the beginning, now i'm in disbelief, i
never knew that this could be such misery, ah
'cause now you see nothing but me
and i don't see nothing but you
and i'm about to flip 'cause we are – super glued in
we stuck to each other's hips and we can't
do anything individually, which is to cling on
scared to be alone, can't specifically describe it
i just can't seem to give a reason
that's definitive, just need ya
talkin' about i live and breathe ya
and you pretend to be as mentally and physically
addicted to me as wiz khalifa is to reefer
don't wanna be without you
don't wanna be with you neither
bitch, put me in a situation in which it's both i wish to seek
'cause this ain't love


you know this ain't love, oh no (oh this ain't love)
you know this ain't love (oh this ain't love), oh no
what is it then?
it's desperation (she's looking for mr. right) (hey!)
(wants me to be that guy to her)
it's desperation (i can't even put up a fight) (hey!)
('cause i give in at the sight of her)
and i here i go again


just want you to myself
don't wanna share you with no one else
"what the fuck you whisperin' for?
you get on my nerves, you make me sick
i think our relationship, it seems to be on the fritz
i mean it's time that we just split and leave the
games behind, your frame of mind ain't the same as mine
i think you need to finish developing a
little more mentally to get the picture"
that's a negative, alicia, i will never give the keys up
to the crib ever again, no visa
not even a gift certificate from tiffany's
you better have an epiphany, slut
guess what? (what?) the lease up
i'm just mad the time it took to discover
you were usin' me for loot like i used you for looks
oh, thought you was too good for me, huh?
yeah, toots, used to be my carrie underwood
i was your lumberjack
but i can't stomach this, i'm leavin' you, i'm not comin' back
she said, "the fuck with that!
where's my louisville slugger at?"
she grabbed that fuckin' bat
and swung it at my head, i barely ducked and that's
right when she came up with a kick to the nuts twice
steel toe, girl probably coulda put a hundred-yard field goal
through the uprights


you know this ain't love, oh no (oh this ain't love)
you know this ain't love (oh this ain't love), oh no
what is it then?
it's desperation (she's looking for mr. right) (hey!)
(wants me to be that guy to her)
lord, it's desperation (i can't even put up a fight) (hey!)
('cause i give in at the sight of her)
desperation (and i here i go again)

yeah
tryna figure out the difference
but i think—think the lines are starting to get blurred


i'm in a strange place
i feel like ma$e when he gave up the game for his faith
i feel like i'm caged in these chains and restraints
grimmin' every stranger in the place while i gaze into space
‘cause i'm mentally rearrangin' his face
i need a change of pace
‘cause the pace i'm workin' at's dangerous
there's nowhere to dump this anger, and thanks to this angst
i done quit chicken heads cold turkey
and started slowly roastin' 'em
‘cause that's where most of my anger is based
fuck your feelings
i feel like i play for the saints
i just wanna hurt you—aim for the skanks
then aim for all these fake kanyes, jays, waynes, and the drakes
i'm frustrated ‘cause ain't no more n'sync, now i'm all out of whack
i'm all out of backstreet boys to call out and attack
i'm goin' all out in this rap shit and whatever the fallout is, i'm strapped for battle
suck a duck, crawl out the back—it's a bar fight
prepare your arsenal
and beware of bar stools flyin' through the air and bottles breakin', mirrors also
and i ain't stoppin' 'til the swear jar's full
"you done called every woman a slut but you're forgetting sarah, marshall" (palin)
oh, my bad, slut! and next time i show up to court
i'll be naked and just wear a law suit
judge be like, "that's sharp
how much that motherfucker cost you, smart-ass?
you're lucky i don't tear it off you
and jump your bones, you sexy motherfucker!
you're so fuckin' gravy, marshall, i should start callin' you 'au jus'
‘cause all's you do is spit them lyrics out the wazoo"
evil twin, take this beat now, it's all you
i believe people can change but only for the worse
i coulda changed the world if it wasn't for this verse—so satanic
k-mart chains panic ‘cause they can't even spin back the curse words
‘cause they're worse when they're reversed, motherfucker
rekcufrehtom! (rape your mother)— tihs! (kill your parents)
and these kids are like parrots
they run around the house just like terrorists
screamin', "fuck! shit! fuck!"
adult with a childish-like arrogance
wild ever since the day i came out, i was like, "merits?
fuck that! i'd rather be loud, and i like swearin'"
from the first album even the gals were like, "tight lyrics, dreamy eyes!"
but my fuckin' mouth was nightmarish
and from the start of it you felt like you were part of this and opposition felt the opposite
sometimes i listen and revisit them old albums often as i can and skim through all them bitches to make sure i keep up with my competition (haha)
hogger of beats, hoarder of rhymes
borderline genius who's bored of his lines
and that sort of defines where i'm at and the way i feel now
feel like i might just strike first, then ignore the replies


there's darkness closing in (evil twin), there it goes again (my evil twin)
it controls my pen (my evil twin), but that ain't me, it's my evil twin
(then i step out and see my evil twin, he gives me an evil grin)
but he's just a friend (evil twin) who pops up now and again (evil twin)
so don't blame me (evil twin), blame him, it's my evil twin
(then i step out and see my evil twin, he gives me an evil grin)


welcome back to the land of the living, my friend
you have slept for quite some time


so who's left? lady gaga? mess with the bieber?
nah, f with christina
i ain't fuckin' with either jessica neither: simpson or alba
my album's just sicker than strep with the fever
get the chloraseptic, excedrin, aleve, or
extra strength tylenol 3s
feel like i'm burnin' to death, but i'm freezin'
bedridden and destined never to leave the
bedroom ever again, like the legend of heath-uh-
ledger
my suicide note's barely legible; read the
bottom, it's signed by the joker
lorena said i never can leave her
she'll sever my wiener i ever deceive her
fuck that shit, bitch! give up my dick for pussy?
i'll be jerry mathers i ever left it to beaver
get them titties cut off tryna mess with a cleaver
golly wolly, i vent, heat register, jesus
ever since 19946 dresden it was definitely in my destiny
when on the steps, i met deshaun at osborn
i'd never make it to sophomore
i just wanted to skip school and rap
used to mop floors, flip burgers, and wash dishes
while i wrote rhymes, tryna get props for 'em
‘cause i took book smarts and swapped for 'em
they were sleepin', i made 'em stop snorin'
made 'em break out the popcorn
now i've been hip hop in its tip-top form
since n.w.a was blarin' through my car windows
leanin' on the horn, screamin', "fuck the police," like cop porn
flipped rap on its ear like i dropped corn
fuck top five, bitch, i'm top four
and that includes biggie and pac, whore
and i got an evil twin
so who the fuck you think that third and that fourth spot's for?
and crazy as i am, i'm much tamer than him, and i'm nuts
then again, who the fuck wants a plain eminem?
but no one's insaner than slim, look at that (evil grin)
(evil twin) please come in; what was your name again?
hi! faggot
look who's back with a crab up his ass like a lobster crawled up there
two rabbits, a koala bear, and a ball of hair
and you're all aware i don't got it all upstairs
guess that's why i'm an addict and it's so small up there
peace to whitney
jeez, just hit me
that i should call the looney police to come get me
‘cause i'm so sick of bein' the truth
i wish someone'd finally admit me
to a mental hospital with britney
oh, lmfao, no way, jo-
-se baez couldn't beat this rap—o.j., no
hooray, i'm off the hook like casey anthony, hey ho (hey ho!)
i sound like i'm tryna sing the fuckin' chorus to "hip hop hooray"
no, i’m hollerin', you got bottom-end like an 8-0-8
and i (base) whether we're fuckin' off that instead of your face so
let your low-end raise, yo
tango, what you think, ho? slow dancin' or bowling?
you tryin' to hold hands with your homie?
what, you think i'm lookin' for romance ‘cause i'm lonely?
change that tune, you ain't got a remote chance to control me
ho, i'm only vulnerable when i got a boner
superman try to fuck me over, it won't hurt
don't try to fix me, i'm broke, so i don't work
so are you, but you're broke ‘cause you don't work
but all bullshit aside, i hit a stride
still shady inside, hair every bit as dyed
as it used to be when i first introduced y'all to my skittish side
and blamed it on him when they tried to criticize
‘cause we are the same
bitch

"what is a nightmare?
the dictionary tells us it is a terrifying dream, a nightmare"


i used to think i had bad luck, but i wasn't superstitious
'til one day i grew suspicious
when i stepped on a crack on aunt edna's stoop
and got pooped on by a group of stupid pigeons
then we flew the coop to michigan to start anew, but ditchin'
missouri for michigan didn't work
so we moved back to missouri from michigan
from missouri back to michigan
someone, put me out my misery, i can't do this again
mom, please stick to a decision
discipline, last thing i wanna do is listen
she's like lex luthor, bitchin’, her rules are krypton-ite
so the walls, i done lost my power to see through them bitches
but i run into 'em, runnin' through the kitchen
pretendin' to be blind superman, 'cause i had no supervision
but i did have a super power though, i could turn into invisible kid
disappear out of sight like a true magician
and one day uncle ronnie brought over this new but different
music into the picture, and it became my new religion


"i remember it clearly, even today"


move back to michigan again, to live with my grandma nan
always itchin' for somethin' to do, was flippin'
through the radio stations one day
and discovered this dj who was mixin'
i say it to this day, if you ain't listened to the wizard
you ain't have a fuckin' clue what you was missin'
i'd zone out with my headphones
all i remember doing's wishin' for shoes
fuck them stupid pumas, bitch!
it's all about them new edition troops
you get them ll cool j coolin' system
made that final manoeuvre to 8 mile and hoover
and somehow i saw my future is in this
that's how i knew my mission
little boom box boomin', spittin'
practicin' numerous writtens
when i'd sit in my room, envisionin' my dreams come to fruition
i remember proof would visit
couldn't wait to play him my new shit
he'd go cuckoo ballistic, go through the roof for his shit
it's like we knew the instant
we touched a mic that both of us two existed
to do this shit; never quit, too persistent


"carved an underground empire"


started a group of misfits, proof had a proposition
if we all band together, there ain't no stoppin' this shit
come up with aliases, bipolar opposites and
be ready to come off the top as sharp precision
if you got dissed at the shop, 'cause if they caught you slippin'
they'd take your spot if someone got to rippin'
you, and you forgot your written
opportunity knocks once, it ain't knockin' again
it tried ding-dong ditchin' shit, i fuckin' got that bitch in
a headlock, cut off its oxygen, slim
is not budgin' like cocksuckin' cinder blocks in the wind
now i got a pot to piss in
spot in that top position, koppin' over the opposition
lookin' like a dog that's pissin', leg up on the competition
promisin' complete dominance, sugar ray robinson
i'm in a league muhammad's in
ali's my colleague bombin' 'em
probably end up on top of 'em
stompin' 'em like ndamukong
i'm russian like a ukrainian, ladainian tomlinson
flow vomits in your face, competitors fall at my waist
you spit a rhyme, i spit in a rhyme's face
so name the time, place
to battle, bitch, i'm still in that mind state
don't make me step on you and make you wine grapes
cry babies, maybe my way that i use words
is loose, but you turds better be careful how you choose yours
'cause feelings scar but egos bruise worse
and the truth hurts – shit, no wonder you're sore losers!
now where's your poo, birds?
ooh, no more trippin' in bird shit
songs of self-empowerment surgin'
words of encouragement, but discouragin'
the rappers, the rap game's god
but the name's not james todd, i'm just a wordsmith
so let these words lift
'cause all i got is bars for you dumbbells
since yours ain't workin' out, each verse is
more merciless than the first is
and you ain't got to wear no shoes and shirt in this bitch
to get served, bloodthirst revenge of the nerds, chka


"know, too, that you'll not escape my vengeance"


but the dumpy kid with them ears like dumbo's gone
word to uncle ron, i'm turnin' into a non-humble don
you blonde dumb hoes, all i got is dick for you to come blow on
so start the show, but i need a drum roll 'fore i go on
better back away from the front row, get launched
show you i'm bigger than dikembe mutumbo
on the fuckin' jumbotron
i'm a juggernaut, you do not wanna rumble, you bomboclaats
i'll leave you stretched out like a fuckin' yawn
so mow the fuckin' lawn, your asses are blades of grass
and i'm fuckin' up this whole landscape of rap
the g.o.a.t. just ate eight acres, an eighth of that
was just to make a path
and take it straight to your favorite rapper
oh, look, my notebook looks smoke-cooked
like the flow stood a foot over the flame on the stove, soot
charred debris floatin' like oakwood
was burnin', return of the no good and i won't quit


"and the next thing i know
something came crawling up from below
something that made godzilla look like a blamed..."


and i don't quit, won't change
it's like a groundhog's day
so crowd around, y'all, 'cause you may-ay
see if i popped your head


i'm a monster, mutt
i'ma turn into a monster
i'm a monster, mutt
with my dick in your mouth all day! (hah)


"i'm not so sure i want to know from whence it came
but the white flesh creature's trail is easily followed
there, before that shimmering veil of light, the ivory skin slug thing"

i went in headfirst, never thinkin' about who what i said hurt
in what verse, my mom probably got it the worst
the brunt of it, but as stubborn as we are, did i take it too far?
"cleanin' out my closet" and all them other songs
but regardless, i don't hate you ‘cause, ma
you're still beautiful to me, ‘cause you're my mom
though far be it from you to be calm
our house was vietnam, desert storm
and both of us put together could form an atomic bomb
equivalent to chemical warfare
and forever we could drag this on and on
but agree to disagree, that gift for me
up under the christmas tree don't mean shit to me
you're kickin' me out? it's fifteen degrees
and it's christmas eve, "little prick, just leave!"
ma, let me grab my fucking coat!
anything to have each other's goats
why we always at each other's throats?
especially when dad, he fucked us both
we're in the same fuckin' boat
you'd think that'd make us close (nope)
further away it drove us, but together, headlights shine
and a car full of belongings, still got a ways to go
back to grandma's house, it's straight up the road
and i was the man of the house, the oldest
so my shoulders carried the weight of the load
then nate got taken away by the state at eight-years-old
and that's when i realized you were sick
and it wasn't fixable or changeable
and to this day we remain estranged, and i hate it though, but—


‘cause to this day we remain estranged and i hate it though
‘cause you ain't even get to witness your grandbabies grow
but i'm sorry, mama, for "cleanin' out my closet"
at the time i was angry, rightfully? maybe so
never meant that far to take it, though
‘cause now i know it's not your fault, and i'm not makin' jokes
that song i no longer play at shows
and i cringe every time it's on the radio
and i think of nathan being placed in a home
and all the medicine you fed us and
how i just wanted you to taste your own
but now the medication's takin' over
and your mental state's deterioratin' slow
and i'm way too old to cry, this shit is painful, though
but, ma, i forgive you, so does nathan, yo
all you did, all you said, you did your best to raise us both
foster care, that cross you bear, few may be as heavy as yours
but i love you, debbie mathers
oh, what a tangled web we have ‘cause
one thing i never asked was
where the fuck my deadbeat dad was
fuck it, i guess he had trouble keepin' up with every address
but i'da flipped every mattress, every rock and desert cactus
owned a collection of maps
and followed my kids to the edge of the atlas
if someone ever moved 'em from me
that you coulda bet your asses
if i had to come down the chimney, dressed as santa, kidnap 'em
and although one has only met their grandma once
you pulled up in our drive one night
as we were leavin' to get some hamburgers
me, her and nate, we introduced you, hugged you
and as you left, i had this overwhelming sadness
come over me as we pulled off to go our separate paths and
i saw your headlights as i looked back
and i'm mad i didn't get the chance to
thank you for being my mom and my dad
so, mom, please accept this as a
tribute; i wrote this on the jet, i guess i had to
get this off my chest, i hope i get the chance to
lay it 'fore i'm dead, the stewardess said to fasten
my seatbelt, i guess we're crashin'
so, if i'm not dreamin', i hope you get this message that
i will always love you from afar, ‘cause you're my mom


i want a new life (start over)
one without a cause (clean slate)
so i'm coming home tonight (yeah)
well, no matter what the cost
and if the plane goes down
or if the crew can't wake me up
well, just know that i'm alright
i was not afraid to die
oh, even if there's songs to sing
well, my children will carry me
just know that i'm alright
i was not afraid to die
because i put my faith in my little girls
so i'll never say goodbye cruel world
just know that i'm alright
i am not afraid to die



i used to be the type of kid
that would always think the sky is fallin'
why am i so differently wired? am i a martian?
what kind of twisted experiment am i involved in?
‘cause i don't belong in this world
that's why i'm scoffin' at authority, defiant often
flyin' off at the handle at my mom
no dad, so i am noncompliant at home
at school i'm just shy and awkward
and i don't need no goddamn psychologist
tryna diagnose why i have all these underlyin' problems
thinkin' he can try and solve 'em
i'm outside chalkin' up drawings
on the sidewalk and in the front drive talkin'
to myself, either that or inside hidin' off in
the corner somewhere quiet, tryin' not to
be noticed ‘cause i'm cryin' and sobbin'
i had a bad day at school so i ain't talkin'
some cocksucker shoved me into a fuckin' locker
‘cause he said that i eye-balled him


and if you fall, i'll get you there
i'll be your savior from (yeah) all the wars
that are fought inside your world
please have faith in my words

i used to be the type of kid that would always think the sky's fallin'
why am i so differently wired in my noggin?
‘cause sporadic as my thoughts come, it's mind-bogglin'
‘cause i obsess on everything in my mind, small shit
bothers me, but not my father, he said sayonara
then split, but i don’t give a shit
i'm fine long as there's batteries in my walkman
nothing is the matter with me
shit, look on the bright side, at least i ain't walkin'
i bike ride through the neighborhood of my apartment
complex on a ten-speed which i've acquired parts that
i find in the garbage, a frame then put tires on it
headphones on, look straight ahead if kids try and start shit
but if this is all there is for me life offers
why bother even tryin' to put up a fight? it's nonsense
but i think a light bulb just lit up in my conscience
what about them rhymes i've been jottin'?
they are kind of giving me confidence
instead of tryin' to escape through my comics
why don't i just blast a little something like onyx?
to put me in the mood to wanna fight and write songs that
say what i wanna say to the kid that said that i eye-balled him
grab hold of my balls, like, "that's right, fight's on, bitch!"
who woulda knew, from the moment i turned the mic on, that
i could be iconic in my conquest?
that's word to phife dawg from a tribe called quest


i used to be the type of kid that would always think the sky's fallin'
now i think the fact that i'm differently wired's awesome
‘cause if i wasn't, i wouldn't be able to work words like this
and connect lines like crosswords
and use my enemy's words as strength
to try and draw from, and get inspired off 'em
‘cause all my life i was told and taught i am not shit
by you wack fuckin' giant sacks of lyin' dog shit
now you shut up, bitch, i am talkin'
thought i was full of horseshit
and now you fuckin' worship the ground on which i am walkin'
me against the world, so what? i'm brian dawkins
versus the whole 0-16 lions offense
so bring on the giants, falcons, and miami dolphins
it's the body bag game, bitch, i'm supplyin' coffins
‘cause you dicks butt kiss, bunch of brian baldingers
you're gon' die a ball-licker, i've been diabolical
with this dialogue since '99 rawkus
you don't respect the legacy i leave behind, y'all can
suck a dick; the day you beat me, pigs'll fly out my ass
in a flyin' saucer full of italian sausage
the most high exaltin' and i ain't haltin'
'til i die of exhaustion, inhale my exhaust fumes
the best part about me is i am not you
i'm me, and i'm the fire marshall, and this is my—



something's burnin', i can't figure out what (out what)
it's either lust or a cloud of dust
judgement is clouded; must
just be the powder from the power of (love!)
but i'm in something i don't know how to get out of
left my girl in the house alone (ah!)
is that my soon-to-be-spouse’s moan?
and the further i walk, the louder (ah, ah!)
pause for a minute to make certain that's what i heard
‘cause after all, this is her place
so i give her the benefit of the doubt, i
think i might be about to bust her, bust her (ah!)
the thought's scary, yo, though and it hurts—brace!
hope it ain't, "here we go, yo!"
‘cause my head already goes to worst-case
scenario, though in the first place (ah, fuck)
but you confirmed my low-end theory though (ah!)
should've known when i made it all the way to third base
and that was only the first date
could've made it to home plate (oh!)
but you slid straight for the dome and dove face first
"no, (*slurp*) you don't (*slurp*) under— (*slurp*) —stand, (*slurp*)
i (*slurp*) don't (*slurp*) do this for (*hic*) anyone, (*hic*) ever (*slurp*)"
yeah, that ain't what they all say?
i'll say, you can suck a softball through a straw
used to be my fiancé
'til you sucked on wayne, andré, and kanye
lebron, akon, jay, lil jon, raekwon, ma$e
polow da don, dre, dante ross, james conway, kwamé?!
guess i'm gettin' my g-goddang jigga on, eh?
'cause your name, i'm beyond sayin' (ha)
but fuck it, i'm movin' on, you women are all cray
but i'll probably always keep on playin' the—


she doesn't love me, no, she don't love me no more
she hates my company, guess she don't love me no more
i tried to get her up out of my head, left my bags at the door
she screamed she loved me like she never did before


so needless to say i'm feelin' betrayed
snatch my house key off her key chain
she jumps off wee-bey from the wire's dick
now she's chasin' me with a cheese grater
here goes that broken record cliché
it's all my fault anyway, she's turnin' the tables, i'm a beat-break
she treats my face like serato, she cuts and scratches like a dj
each day is an instant replay
they say what we display is symptomatic of addict behaviour
back together, but forgot today was her b-day
she cut me off on the freeway
simple misunderstanding, but just as i went to slam on the brakes
that's when i realized that she may be crazy as me, wait
bitch cut my fuckin' brakeline
stepped on them fuckers eight times
still goin' seventy-three, thank god there's an exit comin' up
what the mother-f-u-c-k's wrong with her?
hit the off ramp 'til i coasted to a goshdamn halt
hit a fuckin' tree, now here she comes at full speed
she's racin' at me, okay, you wanna fuck with me, eh?
snatch that bitch out her car through the window
she screamin', i body slam her on the cement
until the concrete gave and created a sinkhole
buried the stink ho in it, then paid to have the street repaved
(the fuck?) woke up in a dream state
in a cold sweat like i got hit with a freeze ray during a heat wave
guess i eventually caved though, 'cause she's layin' next to me in bed—directly aimin' a gat at my head!
woke up again and jumped up
like, "fuck it! i've had it, i'm checkin' into rehab"
i confess i'm a static addict, i guess that's why i'm so clingy
every girl i've ever had either says i got too much baggage
or i'm too fuckin' dramatic
man, what the fuck is the matter? i'm just a fuckin' romantic
i fuckin' love you, you fuckin' bitch!
combative, possessive, in fact last time i was mad at an ex
i actually set off a chain reaction of tragic events
i said, "hit the road", then after she left
i sent that bitch a text that said, "be careful driving
don't read this and have an accident"
she glanced to look at it and wrecked (*car crashes*)
too bad, thought we had a connect
no sense dwelling makes, never been a more compelling case
than the model covered in l'oréal and mace
who fell from grace eleven stories for storytellin'
while the whore was yellin', "rape!"
'til her vocal cords were swellin'
and her voice were more hoarser than tori spellings' face
still they swarm the gates of my fancy estates
to greet norman bates with a warm embrace
'less you're andrea yates, don't ask me for a date though
don't be late, well, the sentiment's great
but wait, think there's been a mistake
you wanted an intimate date, i wanna intimidate
i have infinite hate in my blood
it's mainly 'cause of the game of— (*message sound*)
wait, "dinner at eight"? i have infinite hate in my blood
it's mainly 'cause of the—



yeah, yeah
yeah, yeah yeah
("what's your name?") marshall
("who's your daddy?") i don't have one


my mother reproduced like the komodo dragon
and had me on the back of a motorcycle, then crashed in
the side of loco-motive with rap, i'm
loco, it's like handing a psycho a loaded handgun
michelangelo with a paint gun in a tantrum
'bout to explode all over the canvas
back with the yoda of rap, "in a spasm
your music usually has 'em
but waned for the game your enthusiasm it hasn't
follow you must, rick rubin my little padawan."
a jedi in training, colossal brain and
thoughts are entertainin'
but docile and impossible to explain and, i'm also vain and
probably find a way to complain about a picasso painting
puke skywalker, but sound like chewbacca when i talk
full of such blind rage i need a seein' eye dog
can't even find the page i was writing this rhyme on
oh, it's on the ram-page
couldn't see what i wrote, i write small
it says, "ever since i drove a '79 lincoln with whitewalls
had a fire in my heart
and a dire desire to aspire to die hard."
so as long as i'm on the clock, punching this time card
hip-hop ain't dying on my watch


now sometimes when i'm sleepin'
she comes to me in my dreams
is she taken? is she mine?
don't got time, don't care, don't have two shits to give
let me take you by the hand to promised land
and threaten everyone
'cause there's no rhyme or no reason for nothing


("now, what's your name?") marshall
("who's your daddy?") i don’t know him, but i wonder—
("is he rich like me?") ha
("has he taken any time to show you what you need to live?")


no, if he had
he wouldn't have ended up in these rhymes on my pad
i wouldn't be so mad, my attitude wouldn't be so bad
yeah, dad, i'm the epitome and the prime
example of what happens when the power of the rhyme
falls into the wrong hands and
makes you want to get up and start dancin'
even if it is charles manson
who just happens to be rappin', blue lights flashin'
laughin' all the way to the bank, lampin' in my k-mart mansion
i’m in the style department
with a pile in my cart, rippin' the aisle apart but
with great power comes
absolutely no responsibility for content
completely despondent and condescending
the king of nonsense and controversy is on a
beat-killing spree, your honor
i must plead guilty, 'cause i sparked a revolution
rebel without a cause who caused the evolution
of rap, to take it to the next level, boost it
but several rebuked it, and whoever produced it
("hip-hop is the devil's music")
does that mean it belongs to me?
'cause i just happen to be a white honky devil with two horns
that don't honk but every time i speak you hear a beep
but lyrically i never hear a peep, not even a whisper
rappers better stay clear of me, bitch, 'cause it's the—


it's the time of the season
when hate runs high
and this time, i won't give it to you easy
when i take back what's mine
with pleasured hands
and torture everyone, that is my plan
my job here isn't done
'cause there's no rhyme or no reason for nothing


("what's your name?") shady
("who's your daddy?") i don’t give a fuck, but i wonder
("is he rich like me?") doubt it, ha
("has he taken any time to show you what you need to live?")


so, yeah, dad—let's walk
let's have us a father-and-son talk
but i bet we wouldn't probably get one block
without me knocking your block off, this is all your fault
maybe that's why i'm so bananas i a-ppealed to all those walks
of life, whoever had strife
maybe that's what dad and son talks are like
'cause i related to the struggles of young america
when their fucking parents were unaware of their troubles
now they're rippin' out their fuckin' hair again, it's hysterical
i chuckle as everybody bloodies their bare knuckles
yeah, uh-oh, better beware, knuckle heads!
the sign of my hustle says:
"don't knock”, the door's broken, it won't lock
it might just fly open, get cold-cocked
you critics come to pay me a visit?
misery loves company, please stay a minute!
kryptonite to a hypocrite
zip your lip if you dish it but can't take it
too busy gettin' stoned in your glass house
to kick rocks, then you wonder why i lash out
mr. mathers as advertised on the flyers, so spread the word
'cause i'm promoting my passion 'til i'm passed out
completely brain-dead: rain man
doing a bankhead in a restraint chair
so, bitch, shoot me a look, it better be a blank stare
or get shanked in the pancreas
i'm angrier than all eight other reindeer
put together with chief keef 'cause i hate every fuckin' thang, yeah
even this rhyme, bitch
and quit tryin' look for a fuckin' reason for it that ain't there
but i still am a "criminal!"
ten-year-old degenerate grabbin' on my genitals!
the last mathers lp done went diamond
this time i'm predicting that this one will go emerald! (hehe)
when will the madness end?
how can it when there's no method to the pad and pen?
the only message that i have to send
is: "dad, i'm back at it again!"


bitch… (who's your daddy?)

i own a mansion but live in a house
a king-size bed but i sleep on the couch
i'm mr. brightside, glass is half-full
but my tank's half empty, gasket just blew


this always happens
thirty minutes from home, gotta lay a log cabin
only option i have's mcdonalds's bathroom
in a public stall, droppin' a football
so every time someone walks in the john, i get maddened
"shady, what up?" what? come on, man, i'm crappin'
and you're askin' for my goddamn autograph on a napkin?
oh, that's odd, i just happened to run out of tissue
yeah, hand me that, on second thought i'd be glad then
"thanks, dawg! name's todd, a big fan"
i wiped my ass with it, crumbled it up in a wad and threw it back and
told him: "todd, you're the shit," when's all of this crap end?
can't pump my gas without causin' an accident
pump my gas, cut my grass, i can't take out the fuckin' trash
without someone passin' through my sub, harassin'
i'd count my blessings, but i suck at math
i'd rather wallow than bask sufferin' succotash
but the ant-acid, it gives my stomach gas
when i mix my corn with my fuckin' mashed
potatoes, so what? ho, kiss my country bumpkin ass
missouri southern roots, what the fuck is upper class?
call lunch dinner, call dinner supper
tupperware in the cupboard, plasticware up the ass
stuck in the past—ipod, what the fuck is that?
b-boy to the core, mule, i'm a stubborn ass


maybe that's why i feel so strange
got it all, but i still won't change
maybe that's why i can't leave detroit
it's the motivation that keeps me goin'
this is the inspiration i need
i could never turn my back on a city that made me
and (life's been good to me so far)


they call me classless, i heard that, i second and third that
don't know what the fuck i'd be doin' if it weren't rap
probably be a giant turd sack
but i blew, never turned back
turned 40 and still sag—teenagers act more fuckin' mature, jack
fuck you gonna say to me? i'll leave on my own terms, asshole
i'm goin' berzerk, my nerves are bad
but i love the perks my work has
i get to meet famous people, look at her dag
her nylons are ran, her skirt's snagged
and i heard she drag-races, *burp* swag
tuck in my hanes shirt tag
you're danica patrick (yeah?) word, skag
we'd be the perfect match
'cause you're a vacuum, i'm a dirtbag
my apologies, no disrespect to technology
but what the heck's all of these buttons?
you expect me to sit here and learn that?
fuck i gotta do to hear this new song from luda?
be an expert at computers?
i'd rather be an encyclopedia britannica, hell with
playstation, i'm still on my first man on some zelda
nintendo, bitch! run, jump, punch, stab, and i melt the
mozzarella on my spaghetti
put in on bread, make a sandwich with welch's, and belch
they say this spray butter's bad for my health, but
i think this poor white trash from the trailer
jed clampett, fred sanford, and welfare
mentality helps to keep me grounded
that's why i never take full advantage of wealth, i
managed to dwell within these parameters
still crammin' the shelves full of hamburger helper
i can't even help it, this is the hand i was dealt, a
creature of habit, feel like i'm trapped in an animal shelter
with all these pet peeves, goddamn it, to hell, i
can't stand all these kids with their camera cellphones
i can't go anywhere, i get so mad i could yell, the
other day, someone got all elaborate
and stuck a head from a fuckin' dead cat in my mailbox
went to burger king—they spit on my onion rings
i think my karma's catchin' up with me


maybe that's why i feel so strange
got it all, but i still won't change
maybe that's why i can't leave detroit
it's the motivation that keeps me goin'
this is the inspiration i need
i could never turn my back on a city that made me
and (life's been good to me so far)


got friends on facebook all over the world
not sure what that means, they tell me it's good
so i'm artist of the decade, i even got a plaque
i'd hang it up, but the frame is all cracked


i'm tryin' to be low-key, hopefully nobody notices me
in produce, hunched over, giant nosebleed
ogre style as i mosey over to the frozen aisle
by the frozen yogurt this guy approached me
embarrassed, i just did comerica with hova
the show's over, i'm hidin' in kroger, buyin' groceries
he just had front-row seats
told me to sign this poster, then insults me
"wow! up close didn't know you had crow's feet!"
i'm at a crossroads, lost, still shoppin' at costco's
sloppy joe's, bulk waffles
got caught pickin' my nose (agh!)
look over, see these two hot hoes
finger still up one of my nostrils
right next to 'em, stuck at the light, the fuckin' shit's
takin' forever to change, it's stuck, these bitches are lovin' it
rubbin' it in, chucklin', couldn't do nothin'
play it off, "what you bumpin'?"
"trunk muzik, yelawolf's better," fuckin' bitch!
they want me to flip at the label, but i won't succumb to it
the pressure, they want me to follow up with
another one, after recovery was so highly coveted
but what good is a fuckin' recovery if i fumble it?
'cause i'ma drop the ball if i don't get a grip
hoppin' out shrubbery on you sons of bitches
wrong subdivision to fuck with, bitch
quit snappin' fuckin' pictures of my kids
i love my city, but you pushed me to the limit—what a pity!
the shit i complain about
it's like there ain't a cloud in the sky and it's rainin' out
kool-aid stain on the couch, i'll never get it out
but bitch, i got an elevator in my house
ants and a mouse—i'm livin' the dream!


maybe that's why i feel so strange
got it all, but i still won't change
maybe that's why i can't leave detroit
it's the motivation that keeps me goin'
this is the inspiration i need
i could never turn my back on a city that made me
and (life's been good to me so far)

you fuckin' groupie
pick up the goddamn phone


bitch, where the fuck were you tuesday? with who you say?
i wasn't at the studio, bitch, what'd you do? screw dre?
you went there lookin' for me? boo, that excuse is too lame
keep playin' me, you're gonna end up with a huge goose egg
you fake, lyin' slut, you never told me you knew drake
and lupe? you wanna lose two legs?
you tryin' to flip this on me? if i spent more time with you, you say
"okay, yeah, and i'm coo-coo, eh?" — well, screw you
and i'll be the third person who screwed you today
oh, fourth—dre, drake, lupe—ooh, touché
you were too two-faced for me
thought you was my number one true-blue ace
but you ain't and i can't see you when you make that wittle boo-boo face
'cause i'm hanging up this phone, boo, you make my fuckin' bluetooth ache
you're feeling blue? too late, go smurf yourself
you make me wanna smurf and puke blue kool aid
here's what you say to someone you hate


my life would be so much better
if you just dropped dead
i was layin' in bed last night, thinkin'
and then this thought just popped in my head
and i thought, wouldn't shit just be a lot easier
if you dropped dead?
i would feel so much, much better


think i just relapsed, this bitch pushed me over the brink
hop on the freeway tryna get some time alone and just think
'til the cops pulled me over, but they let me go, 'cause i told 'em
i'm only drivin' drunk 'cause that bitch drove me to drink
i'm back on my fuck hoes, with a whole new hatred for blondes
but bias? i hate all bitches the same, baby, come on!
excuse the pun, but bitch is such a broad statement, and i'm
channelin' my anger through every single station that's on!
'cause a woman broke my he-art, i say, "he-art"
'cause she ripped it in two pa-arts and threw it in the garbage
who do you think you a-are? bitch, guess it's time for me to get the dust off
and pick myself up off the carpet
but i'll never say the l-word again
i lo-lo-lo-lo… lesbian!
aaahhh! i hope you hear this song
and go into a cardiac arrest, my life'd be so much better if you just—


my life would be so much better
if you just dropped dead
i was layin' in bed last night, thinkin'
and then this thought just popped in my head
and i thought, wouldn't shit just be a lot easier
if you dropped dead?
i would feel so much, much better


'cause you told me
you'd love me
forever
bitch, that was a lie
now i never
wanted someone to die
so bad in my fuckin' life
but fuck it, there’s other fish in the sea


and i'ma have a whale of a time
bein' a single sailor for the night, bitch, on a scale of
one to ten, shit, i must be the holy grail of
catches, ho, i got an oscar attached to my fuckin' name (de la)
i might hit the club, find a chick that's tailor-made
for me, say fuck it, kick some shots back, get hammered, and nail her
these bitches tryin' to get attached, but they're failin' to latch onto the tail of
my bumper, they're scratchin' at the back of my trailer
like i'm itchin' to get hitched, yeah, i'm rich as a bitch
but bitches ain't shit, i'd rather leave a bitch in a ditch
bitch, you complain when you listen to this
but you still throw yourself at me: that's what i call pitchin' a bitch
that's why i'm swingin' at this chicks on-site
long as i got a bat and two balls it's foul, but my dick's on strike
so all that love shit is null and void, bitch, i'm a droid
i avoid cupid, stupid! wasn't for blow jobs, you'd be unemployed
oye-yoy-yoy, man-oh-man, your boy-boy-boys
gettin' sick of these girls-girls-girls, oink-oink-oink
you fuckin' pigs, all you're good for is doink-doink-doink
i got 99 problems and a bitch ain't one
she's all 99 of 'em, i need a machine gun
i'll take 'em all out, i hope you hear this song
and go into a cardiac arrest, have a heart attack and just
drop dead, and i'ma throw a fuckin' party after this, 'cause yes


my life would be so much better
if you just dropped dead (i hate you)
i was layin' in bed last night, thinkin'
and then this thought just popped in my head (you made me like this way)
and i thought, wouldn't shit just be a lot easier
if you dropped dead? (bitch)
i would feel so much, much better


i'm just playin', bitch
you know i love you

you used to say that i'd never be
nothin' without you, and i'd believe
i'm shot in the lungs, i gasp, i can't breathe
just lay here with me, baby, hold me please
and i'd beg and i'd plead, drop to knees
and i'd cry and i'd scream, "baby, please don't leave!"
snatch the keys from your hand, i would squeeze
and you'd laugh, and you'd tease
you're just fucking with me, and you must hate me
why do you date me, if you say i make you sad?
and you've had enough of me
i smother you, i'm 'bout to jump off the edge


but you won't break me
you'll just make me stronger than i was
before i met you, i bet you i'll be just fine without you
and if i stumble, i won't crumble
i'll get back up and uhh
but i'ma still be humble when i scream "fuck you!"
‘cause i'm stronger than i was


a beautiful face is all that you have
‘cause on the inside you're ugly and mad
but you're all that i love, i grasp, you can't leave
please stay here with me, baby, hold me please
and i'd beg and i'd plead, drop to knees
and i'd cry and i'd scream, "baby, please don't leave!"
but you left and you took everything i had left
and left nothin', nothin' for me
so, please don't wake me from this dream, baby
we're still together in my head
and you're still in love with me
'til i woke up to discover that that dream was dead


but you won't break me
you'll just make me stronger than i was
before i met you, i bet you i'll be just fine without you
and if i stumble, i won't crumble
i'll get back up and uhh
but i'ma still be humble when i scream "fuck you!"
‘cause i'm stronger than i was


you walked out, i almost died
it was almost a homicide
that you caused, ‘cause i was so traumatized
felt like i was in for a long bus ride
i'd rather die than you not by my side
can't count how many times i vomited, cried
go to my room, turn the radio on and hide
thought we were bonnie and clyde
nah, on the inside you were jekyll and hyde
i felt like my whole relationship with you was a lie
it was you and i, why did i think it was ride or die?
‘cause if you coulda took my life you woulda
it's like you put a knife through my chest
and pushed it right through to the
other side of my back and stuck a spike too, shoulda
put up more of a fight, but i couldn't
at the time, no one could hurt me like you coulda
take you back now, what's the likelihood of that?
bite me, bitch, chew on a nineteen footer!
‘cause this morning i finally stood up
held my chin up, finally showed a sign of life in me for the
first time since you left
and left me with nothin' but shattered dreams
and the life we coulda had and we coulda been
but i'm breakin' out of this slump i'm in
pullin' myself out of the dumps once again
i'm gettin' up once and for all—fuck this shit!
i'ma be late for the pity party
but you're never gonna beat me to the fuckin' punch again
took it on the chin like a champ
so don't lump me in with them chump-ions
i'm done bein' your punching bag
it was november 31st today
woulda been our anniversary
two years, but you left on the 1st of may
i wrote it on a calendar, was gonna call
but couldn't think of the words to say
but they came to me just now—so i put 'em in a verse to lay


and i thank you (uh), ‘cause you made me (uh)
a better person than i was
but i hate you (uh), ‘cause you drained me (uh)
i gave you all, you gave me none
but if you blame me (uh), you're crazy (uh)
and after all is said and done
i'm still angry, yeah, i may be
i may never trust someone


but you won't break me
you'll just make me stronger than i was
before i met you, i bet you i'll be just fine without you
and if i stumble, i won't crumble
i'll get back up and uhh
but i'ma still be humble when i scream "fuck you!"
‘cause i'm stronger than i was

yeah!


wasn't ready to be no millionaire, i was ill-prepared
i was prepared to be ill though, the skill was there
from the beginning it wasn't 'bout the ends, it was 'bout
bustin' raps and standin' for somethin', fuck an acronym
cut the fuckin' act like you're happy, i'm fuckin' back again
with another anthem – why stop when it doesn't have to end?
it ain't over 'til i say it's over, enough when i say enough
throw me to them wolves and close the gate up, i'm afraid of what'll happen to them wolves when the thought of being thrown
into an alligator pit, i salivate at it, wait is up
hands up like it's 12 noon, nah, homie, hold them bitches straighter up
wave 'em 'til you dislocate a rotator cuff
came up rough, came to ruffle feathers, nah, egos, i ain't deflate enough
last chance to make this whole stadium erupt, 'cause—

i can see the finish line with each line that i finish
i'm so close to my goals, i can almost pole vault over the goal post
and if i don't got enough in the tank, maybe i can just siphon enough
to fill up this last can, man, will i survive in this climate or what?
they said i was washed-up and got a bloodbath
i'm not a rapper, i'm an adapter: i can adjust
plus, i can just walk up to a mic and just bust
so, floor's open if you'd like to discuss
top 5 in this muh'fucka, and if i don't make the cut
what? like i give a fuck! i'ma light this bitch up like i'm driving a truck
through the side of a pump, zero to sixty, hop in and gun it
like g-unit without the hyphen, i'm hyping 'em up
and if there should ever come a time where my life's in a rut
and i look like i might just give up, eh, might've mistook
me for bowin' out, i ain't takin' a bow, i'm stabbin' myself
with a fuckin' knife in the gut while i'm wipin' my butt
'cause i just shitted on the mic and i like gettin' cut
i get excited at the sight of my blood, you're in a fight with a nut
'cause i'ma fight 'til i die or win, bitin' the dust
it'll just make me angrier; wait, let me remind you of what
got me this far, picture me quittin'
now draw a circle around it and put a line through it, slut!
it's survival of what?

(yeah) so, get your ideas, stack your ammo
but don't come unless you come to battle, now mount up, jump in the saddle
this is it—it's what you eat, sleep, piss and shit
live, breathe, your whole existence just consists of this
refuse to quit, fuse is lit, can't defuse the wick
i don't do this music shit, i'll lose my shit
ain't got shit to lose, it's the moment of truth, it's all i know how to do
as soon as i get thrown in a booth, i spit
but my respect is overdue, i'm showin' you the flow no one do
'cause i don't own no diploma for school, i quit
so there's nothin' for me to fall back on, i know no other trade
so you better trade your fuckin' mics in for some tool-box-es
'cause you'll never take my pride from me, it'll have to be pried from me
so, pull out your pliers and your screwdrivers!
but i want you to doubt me, i don't want you to buh-lieve
'cause this is somethin' that i must use to succeed
and if you don't like me, then fuck you! self-esteem
must be fuckin' shootin' through the roof, 'cause trust me
my skin is too thick and bulletproof to touch me
i can see why the fuck i disgust you, i must be
allergic to failure, 'cause everytime i come close to it
i just sneeze, but i just go achoo then a-chieve!


i wanted the fame but not the cover of newsweek
oh well, guess beggars can't be choosey
wanted to receive attention for my music
wanted to be left alone in public, excuse me
for wantin' my cake, and eat it too, and wantin' it both ways
fame made me a balloon 'cause my ego inflated
when i blew, see, but it was confusing
'cause all i wanted to do's be the bruce lee of loose leaf
abused ink, used it as a tool when i blew steam
whoo! hit the lottery, ooh-wee!
but with what i gave up to get it was bittersweet
it was like winnin' a used mink
ironic 'cause i think i'm gettin' so huge i need a shrink
i'm beginnin' to lose sleep: one sheep, two sheep
goin' coo-coo and kooky as kool keith
but i'm actually weirder than you think, 'cause i'm—

now, i ain't much of a poet
but i know somebody once told me to seize the moment
and don't squander it 'cause you never know when it all
could be over tomorrow, so i keep conjurin'
sometimes i wonder where these thoughts spawn from
yeah, ponderin'll do you wonders
no wonder you're losin' your mind, the way it wanders
(new-ooh, ooh-ooh) yodel-odel-ay-hee-hoo!
i think it went wanderin' off down yonder
and stumbled onto jeff vanvonderen
'cause i need an interventionist
to intervene between me and this monster
and save me from myself and all this conflict
'cause the very thing that i love's killin' me and i can't conquer it
my ocd's conkin' me in the head, keep knockin'
nobody's home, i'm sleepwalkin'
i'm just relayin' what the voice in my head's sayin'
don't shoot the messenger, i'm just friends with the—


call me crazy, but i have this vision, one day that
i'll walk amongst you a regular civilian
but until then, drums get killed and
i'm comin' straight at mcs, blood gets spilled and
i'll take you back to the days that i'd get on a dre track
give every kid who got played that pumped-up feelin'
and shit to say back to the kids who played him
i ain't here to save the fuckin' children
but if one kid out of a hundred million
who are goin' through a struggle, feels it and relates, that's great
it's payback, russell wilson fallin' way back
in the draft, turn nothin' into somethin', still can make that
straw into gold, chump, i will spin—rumpelstiltskin in a haystack
maybe i need a straightjacket
face facts: i am nuts for real, but i'm okay with that
it's nothin', i'm still friends with the


i'm friends with the monster that's under my bed
get along with the voices inside of my head
you're tryin' to save me, stop holdin' your breath
and you think i'm crazy, yeah, you think i'm crazy
i'm friends with the monster that's under my bed
(get along with) get along with the voices inside of my head
(you're tryin' to) you're tryin' to save me, stop holdin' your breath
(and you think) and you think i'm crazy, yeah, you think i'm crazy
well, that's nothin'

(new-ooh, ooh-ooh)
(new-ooh, ooh-ooh)
(new-ooh, ooh-ooh)
well, that's nothin'
(new-ooh, ooh-ooh)
(new-ooh, ooh-ooh)
(new-ooh, ooh-ooh)
(new-ooh, ooh-ooh)

guess i got a way with words, i could get away with murder
ever heard of asperger's? it's a rare condition
it's what you're sufferin' from when you simply don't care if it's an
eighty degree day and there's no frickin' air conditionin'
and you can't see the bitch’s hair is frizzin'
'cause you got the windows up, blarin' the system
in your chevrolet prizm
the devil ain't on a level same as him
picture someone who revels in straight masochism
and imagine him givin' an adjective an ass-whoopin'
so bad they should put his ass in prison
a word bully, i verbally abuse verbs
like they did somethin' to me personally
used to get bullied, so i'd cut class and ditch it
now i bully rap, i'm the shit, faggot (sniff it!)
cadillac from a k car
my ass from a hole in the ground, still can’t tell 'em a-part
came straight out the trailer park
screamin', "i'm proud to shop at k-mart," and it became art
and i'm still fed up and as pissed off as they are
to this day i still get in fights with the same broad
at the same walmart, arguin' over the same cart
in the middle of the aisle whilin', i don't give a fuck, i don't play
bitch, you think you saw this basket first?
you're ass backwards like motherfuckin' bob and silent jay
illest shit you could think i would say
mind's like a pile of clay
when's the last time that you saw a villain with a cape
ripped a gapin' hole in it, flipped out
ripped down the drapes, tied 'em around my neck
went down the fire escape of the empire state (ohh!)
slipped, fell straight down to the ground
splattered all over the entire state
and straight to hell, got impaled by the gates
saw satan, stuck his face in an ashtray
while i sashayed around flames with a match
and i gave him the gas face
and this ain't got nothin' to do with a scale
or being gay, little faggot, but by the way
thoughts are gettin' darker by the day
i'm a combination of skylar grey
tyler, the creator, and violent j
it's a fuckin' miracle to be this lyrical
paint my face with clown makeup and a smiley face
i'm insane, every rhyme i say
suns you like an ultra-violet ray
i’m sellin' hatred, buffet style, all the shit you can eat
$11.99, so come on and pile a plate!
i’m throwin' down the gauntlet to see what hell i can raise
with the rhyme i’m spittin' while i’m shittin' on competition
in the meantime it’s always mean time, i'm gettin'—


i’ve been a career asshole
i don’t see why these people always got my back
i done said so much fucked up shit
i was born a mistake, but i was put here not by accident
i had a purpose and that purpose
was to beat a beat purplish, slaughter tracks
i done put my two dimes and a nickel in this shit
i’m comin' to get that quarter back
like ndamukong, the drama can build
your mama can ask me for my autograph
'cause that cougar's a milf
she's the oldest trick in the book, but i sure would fall for that
you done brought a bat to a rocket launcher fight
when i get on the mic i'ma snap
make you wish the ambulance that took me to the hospital
when i overdosed woulda caught a flat
if it makes you sick to your stomach, acid indigestion
my suggestion’s kaopectate
if it feels like i'm runnin' away with the game
it's 'cause i am, don't speculate, spectate
all i got is dick for days and insults for decades
but i get by with my wicked ways
lady, you can suck a dick 'til your neck aches
cry 'til you get puffy eyes, red faced
but i'm leavin' on this jet plane
you ain't fly, you're an airhead
and i'm sick of poundin' a square peg in a round hole
sorry, another catchphrase
but your baggage ain't gon' fit in my storage overhead space
'cause it just ain't big enough to fit your damaged goods
other words: don't try to put your heart in a headcase
'cause, baby, stable mentally i ain't
i need my meds, i peed my bed
i'm going blind, i don't see my legs, i keep on falling down
no wonder you can't stand me, i need my cane
someone help me, i think my face is melting
if you felt these migraines
and see these maggots eat my brain
this g-i-a-n-t hole in my empty head
if you read my mind, you can see my pain
and you'd see why i be this way
ever since i was knee-high playin' with g.i. joes
told these hoes shut their p-i-e holes, now peep my game
'cause i'm 'bout it 'bout it
like a fuckin' (fuckin') echo (echo)
(psych) psycho on a cyclone cycle, spiralin', here i go
i'm outta control like no other mic go
stab you 'til the knife goes – dull
i'm nothin' but a hole inside your skull where your eye goes
'cause i'ma sock it to you!
dyke ho, you don't like it?
get on your harley davidson menstrual cycle
and ride it like a motorbike
i'm finna blow the mic the whole night, so
strike up the fuckin' maestro, i'm nitro
and hi, ho, hand me my shovel!
i'm liable to dig my hole deeper
and it's off to h-e double hockey sticks, i go


ohh, please be empty
please be empty, please be empty
thank you, god!
shit… is that a girl?
i'm gonna rock this blouse and put a cock in my mouth
and get my balls blew out, and get gay into the a.m.​
and lay with eighteen guys naked
and let myself show, let myself show
buttfuck it, suck it, pull it, tug it
life's too short to not stroke your bone
so everybody, everybody
circle jerk, touch my body (ahhhhhh!!)
who is that? where are you going? come back!
why does everyone always leave me?
hello? fuck you then!
blow it out your ass!
