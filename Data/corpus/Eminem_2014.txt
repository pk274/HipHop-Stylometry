another day, another hotel, the inside of it is nice though, oh well
this is my life so as i go and try on clothes for tonight's show
to see how far that line goes, still blows my mind, show business
guess i'll just never get, so this shit just always feels so weird
to this day because all's i ever did
was just say the shit i would've wanted to hear
other people say to me when i was a kid
so please don't make me some type of hero
'cause i will say some ol' inspirational shit in a real way
but still will have a field day with some of the fucked up shit
in the world and tell it to suck on the dick, 'cause i still make fun
of a sitch someone's in like a son of a bitch at another's expense
i'm fuckin' relentless as fuck when it comes to this pen
i struggle with coming to senses, stuck on the fence
it's a balance beam, if i seem unbalanced, it's challenging
when my conscience allows me to think the most foulest
childish things without even blinking, without even thinkin' about
all the stinkin' amounts of people that seems to be reachin'
but the crowds, they're screaming
and the palace sold out this evening
but now it's lay me down to sleep
and is it really my soul to keep, or have i sold it cheap?
is it greed? and do i take more than i need?
when i joke of leavin', but keep overachievin'
'cause what it's stole from me i've barely broken even


so a martyr is how i paint myself
and through my harrowin' ordeals i’m so vain i want my respect
but ignore the butterfly effect that comes from my dialect
'til i sit in the dark and i reflect
and my reflection shows what it's like here
'cause this vanity, surrounded by all these lights
yeah, it's like a nightmare
i said, this vanity surrounded by these lights is a night mirror
and i don't like how i see myself, so i open the bible to isaiah
'cause i swear to christ there are nights when i stay up and might
say a prayer twice just to make sure god hears
'cause this ice layer i skate on's a nice way of putting it
but i like stayin' feistier than a triceratops and like a dice player
i got a nice paradise here, sealed off in my lair
away from the bullshit good safe place to sit and talk shit from
and this house, is quite bare, but it ain't when you can't leave it
and i feel so isolated, it's nice i made it
but it's like i paid the price of fame twice, i hate it
so i bitch about my life then make another song
vicious cycle ain't it, then wonder why i stay famous
i keep walkin' the line, this goldfish bowl gets old
but especially when you don’t know
if your conscience is sayin' i told you so
'cause you don't even know anymore
if you got the soul of a soldier, or you sold your soul


and from here you look so small
hovering high above us all
please come back to me

i still remember the times when
they were simpler than the rhymes of
vanilla ice were when i was just killin' the mics
i'll never forget what that feeling was like
i miss those times now when i was just starting out
without a dime and now i'm diamond
i can't even stage dive in the crowd anymore now when i've been
stuck in this house hibernatin', hate even going outside
it sucks, sometimes i just wanna walk into target and look at shit and browse, i don't even want to buy nothin'
i just wanna fuckin' walk around inside it
look how excited i sound when i get to talkin' bout life and
everything about it i miss, which now reminds me
put a thousand lighters in the sky for the outsidaz
wow, i must have had alzheimer's
long time since i shouted them out, 'bout time
'cause it's been on my mind lately how
zee, you always supported me
you vouched, i will never forget that and
how you guys accepted me for me and pace
i love you too, you slept on my couch
and i've been thinkin' 'bout the time
when i slept on the floor at the outhouse
rhyming's all we ever wanted to do
and regardless how life has turned out
inside i'll, i'll always be an outsider
my life has been turned inside out but i—


but i keep walkin' the line...

sometimes i feel like all i ever do is
find different ways to word the same old song
ever since i came along
from the day the song called “hi! my name is” dropped
started thinking my name was fault
‘cause any time things went wrong
i was the one who they would blame it on
the media made me the equivalent
of a modern-day genghis khan
tried to argue it was only entertainment, dawg
gangster? nah, courageous balls
had to change my style, they said i'm way too soft
and i sound like az and nas, out came the claws
and the fangs been out since then
but up until the instant that i went against it
it was ingrained in me
that i wouldn't amount to a shit stain, i thought
no wonder i had to unlearn everything my brain was taught
"do i really belong in this game?", i pondered
i just wanna play my part
should i make waves or not?
so back and forth in my brain the tug of war wages on
and i don't wanna seem ungrateful
or disrespect the art form i was raised upon
but sometimes you gotta take a loss
and have people rub it in your face
before you get made pissed off
and keep plugging, it's your only outlet
and your only outfit, so you know they gonna talk about it
better find a way to counter it quick and make it… ah
feel like i've already said this a kabillion 80 times
how many times can i say the same thing
different ways that rhyme?
what i really wanna say is, if there's anyone else that can relate to my story, bet you feel the same way i felt
when i was in the same place you are, when i was afraid to—


i was a, afraid to make a single sound
afraid i would never find a way out, out, out
afraid i'd never be found (my dreams)
i didn't wanna go another round (yeah)
an angry man's power will shut you up (agh!)
and trip wires fill this house with tip-toed love
run out of excuses for everyone
so here i am and i will not run (yeah)


i know what it was like, i was there once
single parents, hate your appearance
as you struggle to find your place in this world
and the pain spawns all the anger on
but it wasn't 'til i put the pain in song
learned who to aim it on that i made a spark
started to spit harder shit
learned how to harness it while the reins were off
and there was a lot of bizarre shit, but the crazy part
was soon as i stopped saying i gave a fuck
haters started to appreciate my art
and it just breaks my heart to look at all the pain i caused
but what am i gonna do when the rage is gone
and the lights go out in that trailer park? oh
and the window is closing and there's nowhere else that i can go with flows and i'm frozen
‘cause there's no more emotion for me to pull from
just a bunch of playful songs that i make for fun
so, to the break of dawn, here i go recycling the same old song
but i'd rather make “not afraid 2”
than make another motherfucking “we made you,” ah
now, i don't wanna seem indulgent
when i discuss my lows and my highs
my demise and my uprise, pray to god
i just open enough eyes later on
and gave you the supplies and the tools
to hopefully use that'll make you strong
enough to lift yourself up, when you feel like i felt
‘cause i can't explain to y'all how dang exhausted my legs felt
just having to balance my dang self
when on eggshells, i was made to walk
but thank you, ma, ‘cause that gave me the
strength to cause shady-mania, so when they empty that stadium
least i made it out of that house
and found a place in this world when the day was done
so this is for every kid who all's they ever did
was dreamt of one day just getting accepted
i represent him or her, anyone similar
you are the reason that i made this song
and everything you're scared to say
don't be afraid to say no more
from this day forward, just let them a-holes talk
take it with a grain of salt—and eat their fucking faces off!
the legend of the angry blonde
lives on through you when i’m gone, and to think i was a—


i was a, afraid to make a single sound
afraid i would never find a way out, out, out
afraid i'd never be found (my dreams)
i didn't wanna go another round (yeah)
an angry man's power will shut you up (agh!)
and trip wires fill this house with tip-toed love
run out of excuses for everyone
so here i am and i will not run (yeah)



i feel phenomenal as usual
pharmaceuticals, glue sniffin', pools of vomit at bonnaroo
but i don't know if i'm in tennessee, chicago, or houston
in the corner tryin' to seek solitude
shallow but such a hollow dude
i won't even swallow solid food
alcoholic too, plus i'm on lean like the tower of pisa
top it off i'm on mushrooms, so fuck all of you!
roses are violet, mollies are blue
lost in a ball of confusion, it's all an illusion
it's probably the shrooms i'm on
‘cause i think i started hallucinating, ‘cause i just thought i heard jay electronica and odd future's new shit
and all i could do was follow the music
and end up with paula abdul at lollapalooza
fillin' water balloons with nail-polish remover
just to pop 'em and wallow in fumes
i feel uptight, i gotta get looser
after i finish polishing off this bottle of booze i got a solution
concentrated like orange juice, so i'm not as deluded
‘cause all this delusion got me seein' shit
excusez-moi, but that hoochie that passed
you see her ass? wouldn't make her my main squeeze
butt juicier, ass, it belongs in a juicer
it's mouth-waterin' too
so i walked over to her, like, “i’m marshall
wanna try to meet my standards? i'll introduce ya"
oh, i'm a misogynist too, but i'm not a masseuse
but my attitude is rubbin' off on the youth, uh!
chronic abuser, and i don't mean a user of marijuana
i mean verbal assault that i use to smoke all of you losers
got a bazooka, a shotgun, a ruger, a glock, and a nuke
and a rottweiler too, and i'm not in the mood, so
when i say i'm bringing the tec out
i'm not coming to repair your fuckin' electronic computers
god, i'm gonna puke, i'm so gone off the hookah
i think i swallowed a loofah
i'm tore up, demolished, i'm fuckin' stoned like oliver
like i looked medusa in the eyeball to seduce her
the thoughts i produce are loony tunes
the box of reusable latex gloves and the socks and the shoes
that were placed next to veronica's boobs
and the paycheck stubs that were stuffed in the glove box
in a blue honda with used condoms were clues
the girl was just not the one suitable for him


right for me, (that will) change me
rearrange my head to be
just right for you and me
don’t laugh, please listen to me


thought i’d give in to the pressure
collapse and crumble perhaps, relapsing under that
well, that's a bunch of crap
in the clutch, i'm the captain crunch of rap
and i'm sick of acting humble, that's enough of that
fuck that shit, cut the sack
like it's a natural reaction
that's why i'm actually trapped in this shoving match
‘cause push keeps coming to that
i can keep getting my ass kicked and coming back
like a sarcastic crumpled sack of shit, still mad
disgruntled, had some struggles, yeah
but that passion and hunger's back
what a fantastic juggling act!
and the way i flip my tongue on the track
it's like verbal acrobatics, but in fact
last time i tried to pull off a dramatic stunt as drastic
i fuckin' crashed my hovercraft
after i strapped a duffel bag to my back
and stuffed a massive punchin' bag in it
and an elastic bungee strap, rubber, plaster, a thumb tack
and a piece of plastic bubble wrap
went spastic and fuckin' snapped
jumped and splashed in a puddle of battery acid
stumbled back, recovered, back flipped
and landed on a gymnastic tumble mat
and for my last trick, lunge on back
latch on a nasa shuttle flap, fuckin' snap the rudder in half
chuckled and laughed, utter my last rebuttal
and just as i'm to come crashin'
i grab my go-go-gadget inflatable gigantic humongous mattress and ceramic construction hat
rub my magic mushroom tat
for luck, then splat, get up from that
face taped to a waste paper basket
throw up, then gasp, lungs collapsed
and that's more likely than finding someone that's…


right for me, (that will) change me
rearrange my head to be
just right for you and me
don’t laugh, please listen to me


couple of shots of jäger
public intoxication, dis-fuckin'-combobulation
flooded with thoughts of anger
while i was away i know probably some of you got to thinkin'
"you're top ten, ain't cha?"
stop it, you fuckers are talkin' crazy
and stop interrupting, you're not even up in that conversation
whether you're punchin' a clock or famous
underground, pop, or nameless
whatever your job is, i give a fuck what's your occupation
you're thinkin' just ‘cause you came in with scrubs
and you brought the scalpel and sponge
the oxygen tank and the suction and shot the brain surgeon
stuck in the operating room
once you done swapped your name with him
smuggled in ronald reagan
if you dug him up; donald fagen
while juggling waffles, bacon
a fuckin' mcdonalds egg and cheese sausage bagel finagled it
flung it across the table
then bump it and knock it shake it
jumped and got in the way, then disrupted my concentration
i said fuck it and lost my patience
they all woke up from sedation
ain't none of you dr. dre, so then what is it got you thinkin'
you can fuck with this operation?!
(aftermath) still running hip-hop amazin'
i'm still pluggin' along
no need for an assumption, here's confirmation
i'm up for the long duration
i'm just looking for something to walk away with
some pocket change and a little integrity
though i'll probably be jumpin' across the stage
'til i'm fuckin' madonna's age and
stuck in an awkward place in my life
but i shit you not like i'm plugged up with constipation
that day will come
before i finally stumble upon some lady that’s…


right for me, (that will) change me
rearrange my head to be
just right for you and me
don’t laugh, please listen to me

i'm liable to start a violent spark with a silent thought
i disgust you like dialogue from the shop to the wired frog
night club, shit, i was taught
if your cd's on fire you had to put it out yourself like highland park
no fire department, so you might not hear sirens at all
but don't be alarmed if i sound off
something just ain't right with me, dog
a martyr on a private charter, whose life could be harder?
widely regarded highly? bite me, sweetheart
i'm slightly retarded, but tonight i'm startin'
shit, i'm feeling self righteous and might just hop in a mosh pit
on some mike tyson and pac shit
lookin' to box with anybody, disorderly conduct
i'll fuck around and snort a key and pick a fight with a locksmith
fan of the lox, bananas, manic, i'm going in shock
frantic, i'm trapped in a closet
panic attack 'cause i'm claustrophobic
no, faggot, i mean i can't maneuver for movement
'cause i have no room for improvement
i'm practically squashed, compacted and boxed in
toxic, cans of arsenic, flammable bars, examine the content
bar exam, start of insanity
charles hamilton slash manson and bronson
animal snarls, cannibal jaws
shark mandibles, lambs to the slaughter
looking skantless as hannibal's stalking
anthony hopkins with his hands in his pockets
*whistle* black out, zach galifianakis
gallons of vodka, but that gal has some knockers
i bet'cha they ring a bell when i come back and i'm conscious
what happened, doc? i passed out again
alcohol's making me break into vacant's naked
stolen magnum box and bag cirocs in back of a datsun
fell asleep watching fear factor and scare tactics
too close to the stairmaster
poked a hole in the air mattress and popped it
woke up shortly thereafter, hungover
no underwear, grasping a bayer aspirin and dropped it
air maxes in my closet, preposterous nikes made out of ostrich
and the cross stitching is a cross mixing
of a rhinoceros, possum skin, giraffe and a dolphin
fin, cotton dockers, oshkoshes, drop crotches
swatch watches and sneakers match with the parkas
but it's like being overstaffed at a boxing gym
with all these trainers, but i don't have any boxers
and i'm standing here naked, hangover, still wasted
like paper you write raps on, obnoxious
yo, why does it always sound like i'm grabbing my nostrils?
fuck that, i'll battle 'em all, i'll battle a mall
i’ll stand there and yell that at a wall
'til the mannequin dolls scatter and the inanimate objects
that i'm battering all shatter and fall
'cause i hear the track and i'm starting to get fucking amped
i'm a spark plug, i'm like the car with the cables
hooked up to my fucking back, i'm a duracell
but i sure as hell got it backwards 'cause y'all get jumped
and i'll catch the battery charge, but
i got a hunch like your back when it's arching
when i start attacking your squadron
you'll feel like mastercard when i'm charging
so take a swipe at me, i'm coming straight at you
like clay matthews from the green bay packers
so get the sack like wisconsin
that's nutbag that i'm talking, who am i kidding?
you faggots are all gonna do my bidding
don't get dragged to the auction
neiman marcus, bags of vuitton and all
i'll push a bitch into oncoming traffic, just watch this
stretched, tinted, black sedan my ass
see how mad you act when i drop you off at saks fifth ave
in a fucking taxi cab to go shopping
affable guy next door's laughable
my next whore's gonna have mechanical arms
that'll jack me off with a lotion dispenser with a motion sensor
no emotion, hence i guess this sick prick dies hard
i got a magic johnson
it's like a magic wand allows me to not let a blonde arouse me
if ronda rousey was on the couch with the condoms out
holding a thousand magnums at once to pounce me
i laugh in response to how she dances and flaunts it around me
her flat little badonkadonk is bouncing around
and all i see is paulie malignaggi, she slaughterhouse in a blouse
and madonna with mud on her, god dammit i am a misogynist
i slap linda ronstadt with a lobster, throw her off a balcony
just so happens she's fond of algae
'cause now she faceplants on the concrete
complete lack of responsibility
half of you assholes ain't strong enough to pick up a spirit
shit, you fags couldn't shoplift at a thrift shop
but i let the track lift 'em up, boost the energy
klepto, i'm back to rip shop up, but my thing is this now
five-finger discount
been rapping so long i've been killing this shit, it's easy
kidnapping your mom 'cause i'm still in this bitch, thievery
ransom for jonbenét ramsey, and chandra levy, and gary condit
(em) paul was scared that if i went back to the blonde
i might relapse, get on some bullshit
perhaps i'll launch some cracker taunts at action bronson
macklemore, mac miller and asher roth
and have some back and forths
and record a wack response to kendrick lamar's "control" verse
and perform "fack" in concert *"fack" plays*
yo, i put that shit on a greatest hits album
now that was awesome
it takes some massive balls to do some shit like that
sometimes i have to ponder why people are like (i'll stick around)
and put up with my crap so long for, what's the attraction, mama?
is it the fact that i'm a walking, talking, actual quadruple entendre
or the pointy nose that's pointing at you, mama?
who knows at this point, it's always poking so na-ah
still get along with this voice 'cause that's the "monster"
so do-si-do with the (na-ah) sociopath
everyone who knows me knows that
what they don't know is the fact rihanna calls me pinocchio
(na-ah) she loves the way i lie
sits on my face and waits for my nose to grow
pathological liar, oh, why am i such an asshole
that my disguise is pants, but they on fire
so am i-a, (wu) cappadonna, cut the track off
sabotage christmas, crap in your stocking
i'm wrapping up all the presents
in fucking camouflage so you can't even find 'em
jack santa claus, snap rudolph's antlers off
wrap his schnoz in gauze bandage and blind him
blowing a head gasket at bed, bath and beyond
put the basket back all the bath salt packets are gone, i
know you really tired of me sampling billy squier
but classic rock acid rap is the genre
got slash on guitar, splash of bizarre, thrasher, and aerosmith
and i'm a spectacular archer, feed count dracula chocula
godzilla, half dragon and bob dylan, bandwagoners
i'm kicking the damn stragglers off and i'm strangling 'em
smack kim basinger on her ass in the sauna
