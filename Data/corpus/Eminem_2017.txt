if i could rewind time like a tape
inside a boombox, one day for every pill or percocet that i ate
cut down on the valium, i'da heard everything
but death is turning so definite—wait!
they got me all hooked up to some machine
i love you, bean, didn't want you to know i was struggling
feels like i'm underwater submerged like a submarine
just heard that nurse say, my liver and kidneys aren't functioning
been flirtatious with death, skirt-chasing, i guess
it's arrivederci, same nurse, just heard say they're unplugging me
and it's your birthday, jade, i'm missing your birthday
baby girl, i'm sorry, i fucking hate when you hurt, hai
and sweeties, thank you for waiting to open gifts
but, girls, you can just open 'em
dad ain't making it home for christmas
wish i had the strength to just blow a kiss
i go to make a fist, but i can't make one, i'm frozen stiff
i yell, but nothing comes out, i'm crying inside, i shout
my vocal cords won't permit me, i scream, but it's not aloud
you put your arm around momma to calm her, wow
i just thought about the aisle i'll never get to walk us down
never see you graduate in your caps and gowns
it's 'bout to be 2008, how's this happening now?
i've got so much more to do
and, proof, i'm truly sorry if i let you down, but this tore me in two
the thought of no more me and you
you gave me shoes, nikes like new for me for school
doody, i'm trying, but you, you were the glue that binded
so many things—time, i'd give anything to rewind it
i had to walk down my halls and constantly be reminded
by pictures all on my walls and i couldn't sleep at night 'cause
that image burned in my brain of you on that table
me falling across your body, not able to stand to save you
god, why did you take him?
i'm tryna keep his legacy alive, but i'm dying, where's nathan?
little ladies, be brave, take care of your mother
smile pretty for pictures, always cherish each other
i'll always love ya, and i'll be in the back of your memory
and i know you'll never forget me
just don't get sad when remembering
and, little bro, keep making me proud
you better marry that girl 'cause she's faithfully down
and when you're exchanging those sacred vows
just know that if i could be there, i would
and should you ever see parenthood, i know you'll be good at it
oh, almost forgot to do something, thank my father too
i actually learned a lot from you
you taught me what not to do
and, mom, wish i'd have had the chance
to have one last heart-to-heart honest and open talk with you
doody, i see you, i go to walk to you
and i can feel my soul leave my body and float across the room
nurses lean over the bed, pulling tubes out
then the sheet over my head, shut the room down
girls, please don't get upset
i see them cheeks soaking and wet
as you squeeze hold of my neck, so forcibly, don't wanna let
me go, pillow drenched, emotional wrecks
with every second, each closer to death
but suddenly i feel my heart begin to beat slow
then a breath, machines go (*beep beep beep*)
must've guessed the cheat codes to this shit
i'm tryna rewind time like a tape
find an escape, make a beeline, try and awake
from this dream, i need to re-find my inner strength
to remind me, even if a steep climb i must take
to rewrite a mistake, i'm rewinding the tape

(i don't want it!)
i'll put out this last album, then i'm done with it
one hundred percent finished, fed up with it
i'm hanging it up, fuck it!
excuse the cursing, baby, but just know
that i'm a good person, though they portray me as cold
and if things should worsen, but i bet you they won't
i'm pledging to throw this methadone in the toilet
shred these old letters i wrote
all that old pathetic loathing, closing credits can roll
i'm proud to be back
i'm 'bout to, like a rematch, outdo relapse
with recovery, mathers lp2
help propel me to victory laps
gas toward 'em and fast forward the past
consider them last four minutes as
the song i'da sang to my daughters
if i'da made it to the hospital less than two hours later, but i fought it
and came back like a boomerang on 'em
now a new day is dawnin'
i'm up, tuesday, it's mornin'—now i know (haha)
(*toilet flush*)

we never saw from each other's sides, or eye to eye
just eye for eye, lie for lie, fight or flight
so much baggage, need a luggage rack
but we carry on with our public spats and our feuds
up back in the news, love taps when i dissed you
like it was fun, actually used to run back to the booth
jump back in the studio, give you a tongue-lashing, then you
laughed at the stomach tat with the tombstone
it was funny back in our youth
but then it wasn’t after we knew
that we were done and actually through (and actually through)
but if there's one fraction of truth
if it could be spun back i would do
so many things different (things different)
'cause it was such a dumbass excuse
you hit me once and that i would use
to continue the pattern of abuse
why did i punch back? girls, your dad is a scumbag, i’m confused
because—


you were the beat i loved with a writer's block
the line that's hot, that i forgot
we laughed a little, cried a lot
i'll never forget when you came home and you held hailie
day before you went to jail and daily
how we'd wait for that mail lady
or by the phone for mom to call
and i watched you pull yourself up and we decided on
givin' it one more try despite it all
you're my lightning rod when my sky gets dark
i'm your shiny rocks in that tiny box
when we tied the knot, when we broke the knot
every line we crossed we were supposed to not
every time we fought, the insults they got… thrown too far
words that we said that we didn’t mean
the words that we meant that we didn’t say
the ones that we thought that we shoulda said
letters written that we coulda read
which maybe woulda led to some good instead
and had this put to bed
but i'd be lyin’ still if i said i wasn't sittin' here askin' myself—


how come you can be a lord and a loser?
how come, how come, you can be a liar and a good father?
a good dad, but a bad husband
why are you a good father?
a great dad, but a bad husband (dad) (you said)
forever be a hero in my eyes (i reply)
but there’s always another side to a good father
a great dad, but a bad husband


we brought out the worst in each other
someone had to make the sparring end
'cause i loved you, but i hated that me
and i don't wanna see that side again
but i'm sorry, kim
more than you could ever comprehend
leavin' you was fuckin' harder than
sawing off a fuckin' body limb
once upon a time we're all we had
maybe that's what drew us
to each other, it was true love
shit, we never knew was possible
we might have loved each other too much
and maybe that's what made us do what
we did to each other, all the screw-ups
'cause you always thought that you was
more in love with me
and i was thinkin' i was more in love than you was
for all the times that we thought it worked
'til we saw how wrong we were
when the dust settles now and all the dirt
if i touch the rawest nerve
all i want is for us not to hurt
and it's been an exhaustive search to find the words
but i just heard "mockingbird"
and got the urge to jot some verses and thoughts
the purpose was not to stir up or open wounds
i've caused a few and so have you
or argue whose fault it was
partly yours, partly mine, but really no one's
this is so tough, i'm gettin' choked up
oh fuck it, we both suck
we broke up, got back together
we both thought we had forever
not bad people, just bad together
we were so nuts, backstabbed each other
another blow struck, but there's no duckin' this blow
'cause it's over and it's closure
but i'm not so sure how to close this
i just don't know how some people can be so good
at one thing and so fucked at a whole 'nother
shit, it's no wonder!


how come, how come, you can be a lord and a loser?
how come, how come, you can be a liar and a good father?
a good dad, but a bad husband
why are you a good father?
a great dad, but a bad husband (dad) (you said)
forever be a hero in my eyes (i reply)
but there's always another side to a good father
a great dad, but a bad husband

and i started from the bottom
like a snowman—ground-up
like round chuck, and still put hands on you
stayin' wound up is how i spend time (get it?)
sucker free, confidence high
such a breeze when i pen rhymes
i just got that air about me like wind chimes (yeah)
'nother day in the life (uh)
used to have to scrape to get by (yeah)
now my community's gated and i
made it and my neighbors say hi (say hi)
i'm givin' 'em pounds, i'm upscale now
guess it means i'm way in the sky (way in the sky)
but i still remember the days of
minimum wage for general labor
welfare recipient since a minor
look how government assistance has made ya!
adversity, if at first you don't succeed
put your temper to more use
'cause bein' broke's a poor excuse
that should only give you more fuel
show 'em why you're you
so close, god, it's like i almost got it
but close only counts in time bombs and horseshoes
so i unabomb shit—tick, tick, tick—no remorse, pew!
screw it, i'm lit, and that attitude i blew up on quick
that's why they call me firecracker
i grew up on wic—wick, wick, wick—with a short fuse
i got some important news to report to
anyone who thought i was done: nah bitch, not quite
spotlight's back on, got my faith, where's yours?


do you still believe in me?
didn't i give everything i had to give you to make you see?
i'll never forget if you turn your back on me now
and walk out, i will never let you live it down
i'll never quit, do you still believe in me?


man, i know sometimes
these thoughts can be harsh and cold as ice
to me they're just ink blots
i just fling 'em like slingshots and so precise
so you might wanna think it over twice (yeah)
or you retards can roll the dice
but beef will at least cost you your career
'cause even my cheap shots are overpriced
but this middle finger's free as a bird
nuke warhead at birth, hugest forehead on earth
too short for the verse, studied his formula, learned
how to incorporate a curse
point it towards corporate america
stick a fork in and turn
'cause four-letter words are more better heard
the world force-fed a turd to me, you're getting yours
but sometimes i overdo it, but i just get so into it
i was there consolin' you when no one knew it
when your situation showed no improvement
i was that door, you walked over to it
i'm the light at the end of the tunnel
so people are always lookin' to me as they're goin' through it
when that tunnel vision is unclear
shit becomes too much to bear
since "cleanin' out my closet"
when i was havin' trouble with the snare
i'm that unrealistic prayer answered
and i'ma get you jacked up like you're tryna fix a flat, uh
when you struggle with despair
that double-fisted, bare-knuckles coupled with this pair
of nuts i'm cuppin', i am your 'fuck it' switch, nothin' can compare


do you still believe in me?
didn't i give everything i had to give you to make you see?
i'll never forget if you turn your back on me now
and walk out, i will never let you live it down
i'll never quit, do you still believe in me?


started from the bottom like a snowman
oh man, put that in your corncob pipe and smoke that
but my battery's low, i'ma need a boost to my pack
and i know that i always got proof at my back
i called you "proof" because i knew for a fact
my ace in the hole, homie, i'm callin' on you
'cause i think i'm slowly startin' to lose faith in it, so
give me that inkling and mo–
–tivation to go, hussein with the flow
fake fans that are two-faced didn't show
let heartbeats loop, produce hate in my soul
layin' vocals two days in a row
true statement, hate to go down this road
but there's only one route to cross this bridge
so i walk in this bitch with loose change
'cause all my dues paid, but this booth's takin' its toll
but it's never too late to start a new beginnin'
that goes for you too, so what the fuck you gon' do?
use the tools you're given!
or you're gon' use the cards you're dealt
as an excuse for you to not do shit with 'em?
i used to play the loser/victim
'til i saw the way proof was driven
i found my vehicle and i haven't ran out of gas yet
and when they stacked decks, turn handicaps into assets
fanny packs, hourglasses
if time was on my side, i'd still have none to waste
man, in my younger days
that dream was so much fun to chase
it's like i'd run in place
while this shit dangled in front of my face
but how do you keep up the pace
and the hunger pangs once you've won the race?
when that dual exhaust is coolin' off
'cause you don't got nothin' left to prove at all
'cause you done already hit 'em with the coup de grâce
still you feel the need to go full tilt
that bruce willis, that blue steel, that true skill
when that wheel's loose, i won't lose will
do you still believe?

i built this castle
now we are trapped on the throne
i'm sorry we’re alone
i wrote my chapter
you'll turn the page when i'm gone
i hope you’ll sing along
this is your song
i just want you to know that i ain't scared
whatever it takes to raise you, i'm prepared
to do whatever, to do whatever
uhh, december 1st, 1995, dear hailie
this is your song

you'll be coming out of mommy's stomach soon
i better do something quick if i'ma be able to support you
i can barely support me, but as long as you're healthy
that's all that matters for the time being
but obviously assuming you will be
just thinking ahead, i’ma make it if it kills me
let’s see how far i can take it with this music
i'm getting sick of chasing this illusion (ha!)
sorry for sloppy writing
the pen in my hand is shaking, please excuse me
dad’s a little nervous, but at the same time excited
if i use this same energy while i'm saying rhymes and write them
with the same passion and the same exact enthusiasm
as i'm using in this letter, maybe they can fuel me as i'm
trying to build these castles out of sand, baby girl
for you to sit on the throne, i got plans, baby girl
welcome to mom and dad’s crazy world
love, daddy, maple-flavored kisses, buttered pancakes, and syrup (haha)


i built this castle (mm)
now we are trapped on the throne (uhh, shit)
i'm sorry we're alone
i wrote my chapter
you'll turn the page when i'm gone
i hope you'll sing along
this is your song
i just want you to know that i ain't scared
whatever it takes to raise you, i'm prepared
to do whatever, to do whatever
ahem, alright, let's see
december 1st, 1996, dear hailie

you got your momma's personality, same eyes as i got
her beautiful smile, but your ears are the same size as mine are
sorry for that, a little minor mishap
but you'll grow into 'em, baby, i'm on the grind now
i'm doing little shows, open mics, all-nighters at studios
while i'm tryna keep the lights on
why does it seem like i'm so close to this dream, yet so far?
i just keep steering, i'ma turn into someone
i haven't the slightest clue what i'ma do if it falls through
you took your first steps today, you'll probably walk soon
my infinite cd flopped, too many soft tunes
they're talking bad about dad, it's ticking me off too
makes me feel like i don't belong or something, ooh
i think i might have just stumbled onto something new
got a prediction for the future, i'm hoping that you
open this envelope when you're older and it holds true


i built this castle
now we are trapped on the throne
i'm sorry we're alone
i wrote my chapter
you'll turn the page when i'm gone
i hope you'll sing along
this is your song
i just want you to know that i ain't scared
whatever it takes to raise you, i'm prepared
to do whatever, to do whatever
december 24th, 2007, dear hailie

now if you found these letters, i guess i better try to explain
a lot's happened in between them since i rised to this fame
i've said your name but always tried to hide your face
this game is crazy, i wanted to claim my love for you, but dang
i never knew it'd be like this, if i did i wouldn't have done it
you ain't asked for none of this shit, now you're being punished?!
things that should've been private with me and your mother is public
i can't stomach, they can take this fame back, i don't want it
i'll put out this last album then i'm done with it
one-hundred percent finished
fed up with it, i'm hanging it up, fuck it!
excuse the cursing, baby, but just know
that i'm a good person, though they portray me as cold
and if things should worsen, don't take this letter i wrote
as a goodbye note, but your dad's at the end of his rope
i'm sliding down a slippery slope
anyways sweetie, i better go
i'm getting sleepy, love, dad–shit, i don't know



instinctive nature to bring the anguish (yeah)
to the english language
with this ink, you haters get rode on like a piece of paper
this rap shit got me travelin' place to place
you barely leave your house
'cause you're always stuck at your pad, it's stationary
yeah, that's why when i brainstorm, gotta write it out
simon cowell of rhymin' foul, that's why you sound so shook
wire bound notebook got tied around your throat
hook it inside your mouth, go—hruh
that's what it's like when the mic is out
'cause i'm tearin' at your flesh with it
'til your larynx and neck are split
with these lyrics, weapons, expert with
like hair extensions, extra clips
and you're scared to effin' death of it
bitch, you're starin' at a legend that
in a pair of skechers, sweatshirt ripped
and hoodie black, should be strapped
to a chair or stretcher, electric, swear on every record, bitch
finger so high in the air, i'll bet your senses flip
like a barometric pressure switch
carin' less who i offend with this
i'm at your neck like pez dispense
go 'head, spit your flow, bitch!


and i'll take a hundred of you, hundred of you
all at once like i had nothin' to lose, what can i do?
my appetite for destruction is loose, destruction is loose
and all it wants is to have somethin' to chew
somethin' to chew, somethin' to chew


yeah, uh (haha), and still conjoined at
the hip with hop, still on point and poignant
skilled as floyd is
in this field, and still no filter, boy
i'll put you in your place (yeah) like a realtor, boy
you still ain't in the buildin', boy
i will destroy shit, even as i build it
get the drill bit, pen is filled with poison
which is the source, easy to still pinpoint it
(like what?) like a real thin joint it
(what?) comes on quilted northern
(and what?) in a built-in toilet
(yeah) bitch, i told you i'm a dog (woof)
i wouldn't heal with ointment
way i'm kickin' these fairies' tails
should write a children's storybook (yeah, yeah, yeah)
million voices in my head
but still get a little bit of thrill and some real enjoyment
(off what?) off the feel of going in
(like?) like your bitch when she gives me brain
like she thinks i'm dumb
grabs the crown of my dick and blows me to kingdom come
'til i feel anointed
she makes iller noises
when she's with me, must be from the windy city, uh
pretty apparent, she's a milf when blowin' me
'cause i conned her into
rippin' the condom in two (woo!)
dick is a bargainin' tool
now i'm gettin' blew like klonopins, rude jude
i go there, you wouldn't
well, i still have a few views in common with you
just not youtube, 'cause…


you're a has-been
that has been the case since back when
you last went and threw your hat in the race
you've been trash (bitch!)
stick your raps in the trash bin
or end up in my next rhyme
you're a fuckboy, so next time
it's gonna be heads flyin' like dez bryant
with a tec-9 against rex ryan (yeah!)
now watch me set it like correct time
all you get is sloppy seconds like a timex, i
clock rejects into the next life
talking reckless, but it's just my
strongest suit, but you can get my colombian necktie
prostitute, just climb in the humvee and let's ride
why you hitching at night?
i put an end to your life, sex crime
kidding aside, insidious vibe
girl, you know you got the prettiest eyes
but all you're getting is bribed
any old lie to try to get you inside
then we gon' end up spending the night
and i'm skinning your hide like an indian tribe
what kind of nut drives a budweiser truck
finds a slut, tries to surprise her, cuffs, ties her up
binds up, cuts, slices her twice?
but the muff diver must just like it rough
fuck right in her vagina, blood
flies up on the visor, like a geyser, uh
(music, please!) enthusiast of the roofie
goal is to get a floozy inside the jacuzzi
and have a loosey-goosey as cool c is with an uzi
but i am to rap what blue jeans mean to bruce springsteen
glued we be, i'm trutv, you're too pg
i'm schoolly d, you're spoonie gee!
no diss there, just notice there
are no similarities that we share
besides the fact we breathe air
happily married to rap and i'm glad that we buried
the hatchet and patched it up
now i'm back to ratchet up my attack
and i'm at your mothafuckin' throat like—


and i'll take a hundred of you, hundred of you
all at once like i had nothin' to lose, what can i do?
my appetite for destruction is loose, destruction is loose
and all it wants is to have somethin' to chew
somethin' to chew, somethin' to chew

feeling kinky, lip syncing to too $hort's "freaky tales" (biatch!)
having creepy visions of whiskey drinking
and envisioning sneaking into where christie brinkley dwells
i know this is risky thinking but i wanna stick her like she's decals
but when murdering females
better pay attention to these details or you could be derailed
better wear at least three layers of clothing or be in jail
if you get scratched because your dna'll
be all up under her fingernails
man, he hears you, i don't think he cares
he gives a fuck, even his pinky swears
three personalities burstin' out of me, please beware
her tv blares, can't hear the creaking stairs
she's unaware in no underwear, she's completely bare
turns around and screams, i remember distinctly
i said "i'm here to do sink repairs."
chop her up, put her body parts
in front of steven avery's trailer and leave 'em there


but hey man, i was framed
i know what this looks like, officers
please just give me one minute
i think i can explain
i ain't murdered nobody
i know these words are so nutty
but i'm just here to entertain
how come your shirt is so bloody?
there's a missing person, so what? he's
got nothin' to do with me
i'm almost certain i was framed


woke up, it was dawn, musta knew somethin' was wrong
think i'm becomin' a monster 'cause of the drugs that i'm on
donald duck's on, there's a tonka truck in the yard
but dog, how the fuck is ivanka trump in the trunk of my car?
gotta get to the bottom of it to try to solve it
must go above and beyond, 'cause it's incumbent upon me
plus i feel somewhat responsible for the dumb little blonde
girl, that motherfuckin' baton twirler that got dumped in the pond
second murder with no recollection of it
collectin' newspaper articles, cuttin' out sections from it
memory's too fucked to remember, destructive temper
cut my public defender's jugular then stuck him up in a blender
another dismembered toddler discovered this winter probably
'cause the disassembled body
was covered up in the snow since the month of november oddly
i'm wanted for questioning
them son of a bitches probably just wanna pin this on me


but hey man, i was framed
i know what this looks like, officers
please just give me one minute
i think i can explain
i ain't murdered nobody
i know these words are so nutty
but i'm just here to entertain
how come your shirt is so bloody?
there's a missing person, so what? he's
got nothin' to do with me
i'm almost certain i was framed


still on the loose, they
spotted me inside mcdonald's tuesday
in a toronto blue jays cap, lookin' like your college roommate
with rihanna, lupe, saddam hussein, bobby boucher
or was it cool j? the cops is on a goose chase
just escaped from the state pen
for 
i was framed
i know what this looks like, officers
please just give me one minute
i think i can explain
i ain't murdered nobody
i know these words are so nutty
but i'm just here to entertain
how come your shirt is so bloody?
there's a missing person, so what? he's
got nothin' to do with me
i'm almost certain i was framed

lady, you remind me of my raps on that relapse shit
'cause you got an ass thick as them accents
two ass-cheek implants, call that an asset
'cause you could set a glass on it, it's massive
from the first time i saw you, i actually
said to myself: "i gotta meet her" like a taxi
exactly, love affair in the backseat
sorry if i'm being graphic
but i'm stiff as a statue you sat on a shelf
i feel like i'ma bust, maybe i'm just ahead of myself
let me slow down, slow your camaro
i'm tryna catch up, i'm tryna jump your bones to the marrow
got me under your control and your spell
wanna wrap you up, put you in a bow like an arrow
grab you by the (meow!), hope it's not a problem, in fact
about the only thing i agree on with donald is that
so when i put this palm on your cat
don't snap, it's supposed to get grabbed
why you think they call it a snatch?
i just wanna climb in the sack
i'ma keep it a hundred like my speedometer's at
i'm watchin' you rap, i'm the dude followin' back
about six cars, i'm in the 'lac, and i wanna fack


all day, all day, all night
you ask, i'll stay the night
with you, you say you're fire
me too, you're burning up
i want it—


hate to inconvenience you at the convenience store
but them jeans you wore are like i've never seen before
i pretend i work there while i clean the floor
checkin' you out like the clerk while he rings you up
pull out behind you when you're leavin'
and you don't even know it (word, yo rick, man!)
she's brushin' her hair, adjustin' her mirror
she's rappin' my shit, but she wasn't aware
i was there, or maybe she was and just didn't care
who knows? at least that ain't up in the air for some to see
so like a chick who thinks her coochie don't stink
if she ain't plannin' to do shit this summer's eve
maybe she wants to keep me company
but fuck the pepé le pew shit!
"ain't steppin' to you, bitch," i say to myself
plus she's bumpin' my music, ain't chasin' no tail like a skunk in heat
i could sweat her to some degree
but fuck it, i'm the male, let her come to me
(could you repeat that again?)
"letter" come to me—"mail." "sweater", "heat," "some degree."  fail
fuck it, pull up beside her
sideswipe her dodge viper, wood is so bright
i ask does she want a computer lodged in her vagina
said my dick is an apple, she said put it inside her
i said—


all day, all day, all night
you ask, i'll stay the night
with you, you say you're fire
me too, you're burning up
i want it—


black out, come to, hands covered in blood
motherfuckin' gloves and a shovel stuck in the mud
i just bodied the beat, so that hole musta been dug
'cause it just died like food coloring (duh!)
so let's get turnt like a shish kabab
twist it, ma, like an air-conditioning knob
we'd be great together
don't care if it takes forever
if i gotta wait, i guess it's better late than never
you felt my heat rubbin' off on ya
i love your personality, come on, little mama
you're hot enough to melt rick's beat, come jump in the water
i bet you get your self-esteem from your persona
with an ass to match, girl
your body is lit, you're striking, i'm a gas
girl, you're just gonna have to put them other chumps on the back burner
you got buns, i got asperger's
just let me rest my head between that set of d's
while i shred mc's like cheddar cheese
that's just the thoroughbred in me, ain't a better breed
my dog thinks so too—look at my pedigree! (roof!)
ma, the world is what i think of you
i think you're divine, so i might swing on you
i'm just kiddin', girl, i wouldn't lift a finger, too
unless it's the middle one to finger you


all day, all day, all night
you ask, i'll stay the night
with you, you say you're fire
me too, you're burning up
i want it—


on the ones and twos, to three or four in the mornin'
rick's on the cut like neosporin (girls!)
he's mixin' it up for me, and you're in
a teddy like short for theodore
we're outtie, five thousand
i wanna fuck, it's my big dick
so everybody get ready fucking now!

i'm packin' up my shit, as much shit in the car as i can fit
and i'm just drivin' as far as i can get
away from these problems 'til all of my sorrows i forget
what's tomorrow like? 'cause tonight i'm startin' life again
get to the corner and stop, fuck am i goin'?
besides psycho when i fantasize startin' my whole life over
yeah right, oh and i might go and
get hypnotized so i don't even recognize no one
i try to look alive but there's nothin' like holdin'
your head up high when you're dead inside and i just died, so in
case you're wonderin' why are my insides showin'
'cause i done spilled all my guts and those are mine, so i'm
pickin' 'em up and stuffin' 'em back
fuck it, i've done enough in this rap shit
recovery brought me nothin' but back
to right where i was and perhaps
this coulda been my victory lap, if i wasn't on the verge of relapse


what's in your head, in your head
zombie, zombie, zombie-ie-ie
what's in your head, in your head
zombie, zombie, zombie-ie-ie, oh (yeah)


it seems to be the reoccurring main theme
the shit i would daydream as a kid, i was eighteen
i went from an irate teenager to still raging
as adult, amazing: back then i put anything
into the rhyme, whether it was sad, mad, happy or angry
i spit it, the mainstream, i hit it
yay me, i did it! …did what?
hailie, baby, i didn't mean to make you eighty
percent of what i rapped about
maybe i shoulda did a better job at separating
shady and entertaining from real life
but this fame thing is still the hardest thing to explain
it's the craziest shit i
ever seen, and back then it was like i ain't even
bothered taking into consideration
you one day being older and may hear me say things
i didn’t (a) mean and (b) just ain’t me
okay, so ladies and gentlemen
let's strip away everything and see the main reason that i
feel like a lame piece of shit, i sound cranky and bitter
complain, beef and bicker 'bout the same things
'cause when i look at me, i don't see what they see
i feel ashamed, greedy
and lately i've been contemplating
escaping to get away and go wherever this road takes me
it's making me crazy, what's in my—



yeah, shout to everybody
who's been on this trip with me
you don't have to, agree
but if you feel like me


someone get this aryan a sheet
time to bury him, so tell him to prepare to get impeached
everybody on your feet
this is where terrorism and heroism meet, square off in the street
this chump barely even sleeps
all he does is watch fox news like a parrot and repeats
while he looks like a canary with a beak
why you think he banned transgenders from the military with a tweet?
he's tryin' to divide us
this shit's like a cult, but like johnny he'll only unite us
'cause nothin' inside us drives us like this fight does
similar to when two cars collide 'cause
our spirit's crushed and this spot's a tight one
but here the jaws of life come
to pull us from the wreckage, that's what we get pride from
when we can’t from our stars and stripes 'cause
this type of pickle that we're in is hard to deal
but there's always tomorrow still
if we start from scratch like a scab, get the scars to heal
and band together for charlottesville
and for heather, fallen heroes, fill this wall with murals
nevada get up, hit the damn resetter
let's start from zero, this is our renewal
spray tan, get rid of, get a brand new, better
america, and here's to where it all—


and here's to where we all began, all began (stand up!)
here's to the land that made me
and made me who i am, who i am (hands up!)
here's to the land that raised me
this one for the only place that really knows me
for the cracks in the road that drove me
there's no place like home


didn't wanna piss your base off, did ya?
can't denounce the klan, 'cause they play golf with ya
you stay on twitter, way to get your hate off
nazi, i do not see a way y'all differ
and all you got are race cards, bigot
the swastika with your name carved in it
should be your trademark, 'cause hate's all you played off
and you just lick the plate off
so i guess it pays to feed off of chaos
so basically, you ate off hitler!
but you ain't ruinin' our country, punk
or takin' our pride from us, you won't define us
'cause like a dictionary, things are lookin' up
so much, got a sprained neck, know we would rise up
against this train wreck and take a stand
even if it means sittin' when they raise the flag
to sing "the star-spangled banner"
this man just praised a statue of general lee
'cause he generally hates the black people, degrades hispanics
take it back to the shady national convention
wish i woulda spit on it before i went to shake his hand
at the event or maybe had the wherewithal
to know that he was gonna try to tear apart
our sacred land we cherish and stand for
so, hands in the air, let's hear it for
the start of a brand new america
without him and be proud of where we're from
and here's to where we all—


and here's to where we all began, all began (stand up!)
here's to the land that made me
and made me who i am, who i am (hands up!)
here's to the land that raised me
this one for the only place that really knows me
for the cracks in the road that drove me
there's no place like home


i won't give up
i won't give up on my home, that so many died for
you already know that i won't give up
i won't give up on my home, that so many died for
you already know
there's no place like home, no place like home
wherever i go, no place like home
no place like home, no place like home
wherever i go (yeah)


and here's to where we all began, all began (stand up!)
here's to the land that made me
and made me who i am, who i am (hands up!)
here's to the land that raised me
this one for the only place that really knows me
for the cracks in the road that drove me
there's no place like home

some nights i want to run for the hills
it's never easy with you
i cannot reason with you
but your smile is as rare as it comes
what would i do without that?
maybe that's why i come back
oh, what i wouldn't do for you!


startin' to think we were made for each other
but one of us in this relationship is raisin' the other
you remind me of my mother
we drive one another crazy as each other
and we're both adults, so there's no excuse
for the games that we play with each other
where you at? at a friend's? no, you ain't, mothafucker!
but i give her the benefit of the doubt
whenever the doubt kicks in, shiver when i touch her
'cause i love her so much, i'm a sucker
how her bottom lip can quiver when she's in trouble
she's in hot water, think i caught her cheatin' again
give her another chance? another one after that?
i'm swimmin' in that egyptian river, 'cause i'm in denial
say i don't eat shit, but i got a shit-eatin' grin when i smile
makin' an excuse for us to act it out
she's just actin' out with her inner child
then i set the truth on fire
'cause i'd rather believe a lie
then i breathe a sigh of relief, i don't believe in
goin' to bed mad, i keep on tryin'
to make a bad girl good
but haven't i stood by you in good times?
and bad? i'm startin' to feel like your goddamn dad
'cause i literally feel like you could die if ever should i
leave you for good and never would i
it'd be all bad, never understood why they call it goodbye
but i think i'm a pretty damn good guy
and you're a good person too
i can save you, i can make you change
but i keep puttin' my fuckin' foot in my mouth
every time i gotta come and bail you out
when you get in trouble that you get yourself in
and i'm in trouble, but i can't leave, i'll sell you out
i could never turn my fuckin' back on you—what is that?
i'm co-dependent, i'm just now noticin' it
but somehow it's like every time i'm about to go to end it
i ain't got the cojones to do it, nor the heart
our apartment's tore apart
you're usin' my heart for a dartboard
but god must've aligned stars for us
'cause somebody paired us up
and they say he ain't capable of makin' a mistake
but this one's perfect, 'cause i'm—



i feel sorry for this beat, sympathy pains for this track
this road is takin’ me back
down memory lane with this rap
i can still look out in this crowd, be wowed and be taken aback
i’m simply stating a fact
i had wembley stadium packed
but now we're on a path headed to nowhere and fast
another terrorist attacks
like a tariff, blows half of madison square up, alas
we perish in the blast
but that isn’t scaring us, we pass
nowhere we're fearless, 'cause we're just—


ashes blowin’ in the air
our world's on fire, but we don't care, yeah
(we don't give a… no, no)
wasted youth, always on the road
never lookin' back and we're never gettin' old
'cause the skies are black
but our heart's made of gold (golden)
fuck doin' what you're told (what we're told)
we're goin' nowhere fast


fuck doin' what you're told, act like a two-year old
shit is soon to go kaboom and blow
anyways; for mc's it's a funeral
when i'm devisin' this rhyme
'cause i'm awake and you're mourning
that's why i rise and i shine
like a new day has dawned on me
gusto, guts, bravado
nuts and plus i kick up dust and cuss a lot
i musta got you in somewhat of a debacle
'cause some stuff that's awful
really don't mean nothin' although
there's a lot of shit i said in jest that's tough to swallow
but if at times my heart it seems
like it's in the wrong place, it's probably 'cause it's on my sleeve
keanu reeves speed of life, avoid or veer
or just steer toward it, we're only lookin' forward
but where we're goin', we have no idea
nowhere to go, but hysterical, it's gettin' warm in here
i set the world on fire, was born to be an arsonist
just one spark and it's lit
but i'ma still get dark on this shit
told you i'd leave my mark on this bitch—war machine
but you forced me in a corner
i'm sure to have somethin' for your rear
and in the course of the assault as torture gets more severe
go to war with me, you'll end up blew to timbuktu
i send at you a ten-ton nuke like kim jong-un
and end up ruinin' your career
but when all is said and done
and at the end of my run i'll just rewind clocks, forever young
make time stop, will i ever fall off? that day will never come
'til the pine box, bitch, fuck you! i'm better than i ever was
'til the bomb drops, hope it never does
but i'm not gonna sweat it 'cause
this world's screwed, it's already fucked
and i'm on top, so everyone's just—


ashes blowin' in the air (so we're…)
our world's on fire, but we don't care, yeah
(we don't give a… no, no)
wasted youth, always on the road
never lookin' back and we're never gettin' old
'cause the skies are black
but our heart's made of gold (golden)
fuck doin' what you're told (what we're told)
we're goin' nowhere fast


you can't tell us nothin'
hard-headed and we're stubborn
so, one ear and out the other when we're young, we're young
(we're on the run of our lives)
who knows what the future for us could hold
another shooter? uh oh
(we're on the run of our lives)
no more tomorrows, we're done
and all we are is—


ashes blowin' in the air (so we're…)
our world's on fire, but we don't care (don't care, yeah)
(we don't give a… no, no)
wasted youth, always on the road
never lookin' back and we're never gettin' old
'cause the skies are black
but our heart's made of gold (golden)
fuck doin' what you're told (what we're told)
we're goin' nowhere fast



you claim if you get knocked by the cops
you'll give 'em not even a statement
walk in the arraignment
shoot the bailiff, karate kick the plaintiff
gotti with the stainless
i'll just call it shoddy entertainment
if y'all was in the party gettin' faded
on molly, had the audience sedated
you wouldn't catch a body if it fainted
probably let it fall and hit the pavement
but you'd be the first lobbyin' to claim it
bitch, stop bein' a lame
your hobby isn’t robbery and dismemberin' body limbs
like you was tommy lynn sells
and chainsawin' them in the basement
hardly fits your job description, ain't nobody dippin'
out the back of the club like, "oh my god, he's trippin'!"
only time you get the blade is
probably with the dang lawn equipment, ain't it?
wouldn't take a bobby pin and wave it
i need to stop bein' debated
you're still copyin', xeroxing
i'm still coppin' a feel
like bill cosby at will, poppin' a pill
then spill oxys in jill's coffee
then send her out to the hotel lobby
a lil' wobbly and still groggy
this blond fuck's reprehensible
misconducts, never sensible
kiss my butt, my set of principles
is gone, but 'til i get the president to respond
my pen and pencil is a missile launcher
and senator mitch mcconnell’s
just as big of a bitch as donald—
shit's on, bruh! (ha-ha)
let me sing this shit soprano
while i do it pizzicato
ivanka, stiff-arm her while i'm hittin' on melania
and this song's for all ya


'cause nobody likes me, everybody hates me
they want me to go eat some worms (i hope you offended)
and drag my name through the mud, through the dirt
but i'ma make you eat your words (i hope you offended)
you can try to hold me down, but you better let me up
'cause you're only gonna make things worse (i hope you offended)
'cause i swear when i get up, i'm never gonna let up
'til everybody eats my turds


these drums and hard snares bring out the worst in me
like justin ross harris at a nursery
goin' ham at candy yam
on nanny cam, i'm gettin' handies with the zanny xannys
in the caddy armrest, i'm imaginin' objects
so i'm battin' cobwebs from a daddy longleg
in hamtramck
got the panoramic camera
xanax, a banana hammock and a santa hat
i'm smellin' like a damn mechanic
with a chick that looks like janet jackson with a spanish accent
twice her age and i'm actin' half it (ha-ha)
grow up?
nah, not that i know of, y'all
basement just got a frickin' overhaul
got a stripper pole installed
started rollin' all through those klonopins
like a bowlin' ball
like an overdose on twice the ratio of propofol
and go through no withdrawal
while i get fellatio and give a facial to
an interracial blow-up doll of rachel dolezal
you're so appalled (em…)
so's my manager
bitch, i amateur, fuck a pro career
coast is clear, but nowhere to go from here
and nobody's close so don't compare
they ain't nowhere near, i'm way over here
my competition can't see me—
'cause i don't own a mirror!
but, marshall, you are terrific
so smart and gifted
i'm so narcissistic, when i fart i sniff it
do a fake dab to smell my armpits, whiff it
your anxiety's throwin' gang signs
but i made strides with these rape lines
i'm cuttin' back on women hate crimes
like ray rice when he facetimes
bang, bang, bang, bang time
dang knives're butcher than gay wives
you're gonna need sutures the same size
as the blade i push into caput'cha
when i pull 'em like (what?) sleigh rides
gotta stab a bitch at least eight times
to make it on dateline
i came to stake my claim like a canine
waitin' in a buffet line
so, kellyanne conway
i'm a really bad hombre
come play, belly dance on me
i've been makin' wedding plans all day


'cause nobody likes me, everybody hates me
they want me to go eat some worms (i hope you offended)
and drag my name through the mud, through the dirt
but i'ma make you eat your words (i hope you offended)
you can try to hold me down, but you better let me up
'cause you're only gonna make things worse (i hope you offended)
'cause i swear when i get up, i'm never gonna let up
'til everybody eats my turds


eight-year-old with the wordplay
girl, take this pole like a survey
today wasn't my birthday
but i'm caked up like a dessert tray
so we're in shape
'cause you're in a slurrin' state
i’m a 10, you’re an eight (urinate)
like what i do before, after, and durin' rape!
you wanna get into a pissin' contest
and find out who's better?
and be made a fool out of when i pull on 'em?
r. kelly with a full bladder (r. kelly with a full bladder)
non-high school grad, i'm not a scholar
but i'm so cold when i'm droppin' knowledge
my degrees is the same as i got in college (zero)
but nobody's hotter, you owe me my respect
i owe you nada like haloti, partner
blow me, told you i'm so dirty, homie, you can throw me
in some holy water, with some floaties on
and get the soap and try to get the pope to hold me
while you hose me off and, nope, i won't be washed
you hope to god i don't explode
i gotta blow this spot up though, i got a lotta mo'
i won't put the sugar coating on it though
'cause sometimes you can feel like your energy's expired
rap's got you drained
dead tired, zapped
you feel like a wet pile of crap
but look, man, like the feds buggin' my phone (uh-huh)
i get why you're tapped
"but you gotta get your fire back
catch fire, get upset and fire back!"
is what i tell myself
when times get bad
'cause sometimes i might get sad
but i take the same advice i had
and tell myself like i used to tell hailie
when life's a drag
told her to do like her dad:
don't cry, get mad!
'cause little baby powders
belong in diaper bags
i'm hyper, by the time you see this side of me
i'm right in your ass (sodomy!)
foot up it, i stood up for the kid
who had to put up with the bullies at his school (at his school)
you ain't had to have no money
or go shoppin' just to cop a fuckin' attitude (attitude)
now my dough's amountin' to a mountain
that's rised too high to count it
never asked to be rich, all i did was wish
i had a dime for every time that i was doubted
but then i think about it, then i'm enraged
'cause i just figured out that if i was paid
for the time i spent to put the pen to the page
it'd be minimum wage (minimum wage)
but it's embedded in my head i never hunted for the bread and butter
what i wanted was to be the one that they was scared of but
i'm never gonna get the credit for the sweat and blood
i put up in the pen, and when i'm dead i wonder
will they put me on a pedestal or forget i was ever this incredible?
i guess i better go harder than ever 'cause
i'll never get another motherfuckin' opportunity again
to offend as many people with this, i can simply because i can


'cause nobody likes me, everybody hates me
they want me to go eat some worms (i hope you offended)
and drag my name through the mud, through the dirt
but i'ma make you eat your words (i hope you offended)
you can try to hold me down, but you better let me up
'cause you're only gonna make things worse (i hope you offended)
'cause i swear when i get up, i'm never gonna let up
'til everybody eats my turds

yo! i bust in, devilish grin, disgustin'
asshole, freckled cheeks and a butt-chin
callin' all party animals, get
on the floor when i pop up on some whac-a-mole shit
in search of a chick who's stacked and so thick
and implants are so big
she can hang me up on that rack, big ol' tits
like anna nicole smith
body's bananas and sass to go with
i spot you at first glance and go "shit!"
you wearin' those pants that don't fit
that butt won't ever give up
that's why you stick it out no matter what, huh?
'cause you got an ass that won't quit
so, get on the horn, my saxophone
grab hold of my instrument, get a grasp, and blow "whee"
you just laugh and go heehee
'cause you're just as nasty so that's appropriate
that's why—


i love you, 'cause you remind me of me
that's why i love you, 'cause you're like me (yeah, me)
i said i love you, 'cause you remind me of me
that's why i love you, 'cause you're like me, nasty (yeah, me)


you know, i'm wearin' a new shirt tonight too
with me on it


i'm lookin' at your tight rear like a sightseer
your booty is heavy duty like diarrhea
the plan's to bring you to my house
you're drinkin' jack and beam
i'm thinkin' soon this tramp'll lean so we should bounce
but you're outta your tube-top
if you're thinkin' that mi casa es su casa
yeah, you're a cute fox
perfect ten so back that up like a moonwalk
girl, you're smokin' like snoop dogg
but you must be tokin' if you think you're takin' over my quarters
there goes the dime into the jukebox
two shots of blue hpnotiq and soon i'll
turn this pool hall to a barroom brawl
so, rick, scratch on the break like the cue ball
turn the volume all the way up on your boombox
and excuse the locker room talk, i'm just too raw
but apparently, so are you, ma
'cause you just kicked me in the balls and told me to screw off
and that's why—


i love you, 'cause you remind me of me
that's why i love you, 'cause you're like me (yeah, me)
i said i love you, 'cause you remind me of me
that's why i love you, 'cause you're like me, nasty (yeah, me)


said "can i take you home, where we can be alone?"
shorty, you the shit, girl, i ordered you to sit
i know you're probably feelin' me more than you admit
pull up a chair, sweetie, let me order you a drink
i only go to meetings court-ordered from a shrink
so from the bottom to the top, floor to ceilin'
you ain't run of the mill, you're one in a million
'cause real tits are still fun
but everybody knows fake tits are still better than real ones


so come and spend the night with the guy most are terrified of
but tonight, curiosity overrides ya
beside ya fired up like a starter pistol
crystal, let's slide hon, tonight i'm your pilot
'cause you should be up in the sky, girl
you're so fucking fly, you belong in the mile high club
so come on, baby, the night's young
don't string me along, i'm high-strung
we might wind up on mound like we're tryin' for the cy young
fuckin' 'fore we get to the house
screwin' our brains out like changing a lightbulb
that's why i like ya, 'cause i'm crazy just like ya
now every time i get brain, you screw mine up
i barely can think straight, your head game is a mindfuck
so ready, set, aim and fire
yes, babe, i’m fallin' in like, that's kinda, why i love


i love you, 'cause you remind me of me
that's why i love you, 'cause you're like me (yeah me)
i said i love you, 'cause you remind me of me
that's why i love you, 'cause you're like me, nasty (yeah, me)

he's comin' home with his neck scratched, to catch flack
sweat jackets and dress slacks, mismatched
on his breath's jack, he's a sex addict
and she just wants to exact revenge and get back
it's a chess match, she's on his back like a jet-pack
she's kept track of all his internet chats
and guess who just happens to be movin' on to the next
actually, just shit on my last chick and she has what my ex lacks
'cause she loves danger, psychopath
and you don't fuck with no man's girl, even i know that
but she's devised some plan to stab him in the back
knife in hand, says their relationship's hangin' by a strand
so she's been on the web lately
says maybe she'll be my gwen stacy, to spite her man
and i know she's using me to try to play him, i don't care
hi suzanne, but i shoulda said "bye suzanne"
after the first night, but tonight i am


a one-night stand turned a two-night stand
it was "come sunlight, scram," now we hug tight, and...
he found out, now she feels deserted and used
'cause he left, so what? he did it first to her too
now how am i supposed to tell this girl that we're through?
it's hard to find the words, i'm aloof, nervous, and sue
don't want this to hurt, but what you deserve is the truth
don't take it personal, i just can't say this in person to you
so i revert to the studio, like hole-in-the-wall diners
don't have to be reserved in a booth
i just feel like the person who i'm turning into's
irreversible, i preyed on you like it's church at the pew
and now that i got you i don't want you
took advantage in my thirst to pursue
why do i do this dirt that i do?
get on my soapbox and preach, my sermon and speech
detergent and bleach is burnin' the wound
'cause now with her in the womb
we can't bring her in this world, shoulda knew
to use protection 'fore i bit into your forbidden fruit
fuck!


my name's (ooh), my name's (ooh)
river (ooh), river run
call me (ooh), call me (ooh)
river (ooh), we'll let the river run


always the bridesmaid, never "the bride, hey!"
fuck can i say? if life was a highway
and deceit was an enclave, i'd be swerving in five lanes
speeds at a high rate, like i'm slidin' on ice, maybe
that's why i may have came at you sideways
i can't keep my lies straight
but i made you terminate my baby
this love triangle left us in a wreck, tangled
what else can i say? it was fun for a while
bet i really woulda loved your smile
didn't really wanna abort, but fuck it
what's one more lie, to tell our unborn child?


i've been a liar, been a thief
been a lover, been a cheat
all my sins need holy water, feel it washing over me
well, little one (i'm sorry)
i don't want to admit to something (i fucked up)
if all it's gonna cause is pain
the truth and my lies now are falling like the rain
so let the river run

all my life, i was told, i was never nothing special
i don't need to be reminded of it every other second
'specially when all my self-esteem's
already shot to hell, i'm falling helplessly
i'm embarrassed, i don’t want no one else to see
’cause i feel like i'm a piece of shit every time she yells at me
selfishly addicted, definitely doesn’t help that she
makes me feel like i've died and gone to heaven
but makes life a living hell for me
she does that thing with her lip, now she's melting me
i'm putty in her palms, i’m wrapped around her finger
a yo-yo on a string, she lets me sit there and just dangle
until something better comes along
and she'll just drop me like a hot potato
i look like i'm in pain, but i'm okay though
'cause i know she loves me—my friends, what do they know?


in my moments of weakness
i openly admit the shit i wouldn't normally
i'm extremely self-conscious and enormously
insecure and she uses it to torture when she torments me
it only turns to ammunition for her in this war, when she
gets goin' she don't stop, when i'm up she's like a downer
when i found her it was love at first encounter
but somehow she musta took the carton of eggs off the counter
cracked them and placed all the shells on the ground for
me to walk on when i'm around her
but there's just something about her
that makes me not able to function without her
how can i get out of it when i don't know how to?
i'm a doubter, i'm a pessimist, make a believer out of me
and show me the way now or stay the fuck out of my cloud of rain
'cause i'm going straight down the drain, i'm drowning


it took a while for me to get it, but i think i've figured it out
she don't want me, she just don't wanna see me with someone else
the idea of seeing me happy destroys her in itself
to see me falling to pieces brings her joy and brings her health
but it annoys her to see me get the strength to say, "screw her!"
i threw up on myself, i'm dumb sick, i'm addicted to her
she's tryna block the door, so here's how i do her
since i'm manure, she's a sewer
and this time this piece of shit's running through her
i can see the light, now i'm running to it
what the fuck? shoulda knew it!
who would think she'd actually have the balls to do it?
as soon as i hopped in it, she doused the car with lighter fluid
she's standing there with a rag, 'bout to put the lighter to it
lit the fucking thing on fire, then she threw it



hands up, officer don't shoot
then pull your pants up, promise you won't loot
we may never understand each other, it's no use
we ain't ever gonna grasp what each other goes through


black boy, black boy, we ain't gonna lie to you
black boy, black boy, we don't like the sight of you
pull up on the side of you
window rolled down, 'profile'
then we wonder why we see this side of you
probably comin' from the dope house
we could let you slide but your tail light is blew, out
we know you're hidin' that heidi klum
on you another drug charge, homie, it's back inside for you
and just in case a chase might ensue, we got that tried and true
pistol drew right at you, we'd be delighted to unload it
in your back, then walk up and lay that taser on the side of you
fucked up, but what the fuck am i to do?
i keep tellin' myself, keep doin' like you're doin'
no matter how many lives you ruin
it's for the red, white and blue
time to go find a new one and split his head right in two
no one's ever indicted you
why? 'cause you're a...


white boy, white boy, you're a rockstar
my momma talkin' to me, tryna tell me how to live
white boy, white boy, in your cop car
but i don't listen to her, 'cause my head is like a sieve
white boy, white boy, you're untouchable
the world's coming to an end, i don't even care
nobody can tell me shit 'cause i'm a big rockstar


black boy, black boy, we don't get your culture and
we don't care what our government's done to fuck you over, man
don't tell us your attitude's a result of that
balderdash, where'd you get the chip on your shoulder at?
why you kicking that soda can?
pull your pants up, we 'bout to roll up and
throw your ass in the van cuffed
you don't have to know our plans or what our intentions are
our cards are close to our chest, you better show your hands
and put our minds more at ease
or get shot in the thyroid, comply or die, boy
we're fightin' a crime war, here come the swine
tryna clean up the streets from all these minorities
that's what we call 'em pigsties for
they're like eyesores to police
talk to you like just a piece of trash
feels like we're stuck in a time warp to me
as i kick these facts and get these mixed reactions
as this beat backspins, it's like we're drifting back in
to the sixties, having black skin is risky
'cause this keeps happening
throughout history, african-americans have been treated like shit
and i admit, there have been times where it's been embarrassin' to be a...


white boy, white boy, you're a rockstar
my momma talkin' to me, tryna tell me how to live
white boy, white boy, in your cop car
but i don't listen to her, 'cause my head is like a sieve
white boy, white boy, you're untouchable
the world's coming to an end, i don't even care
nobody can tell me shit 'cause i'm a big rockstar

seems like the average lifespan of a white man
is more than twice than a black life span
i wonder sometimes if it has a price scanner
i feel like checking out on life, can't escape this circumstance
i'd rather hear 'em say "die n-word" than die antwoord
ninja, now it's better disguised banter
but that's life, strapped 'cause we're strapped financially
and can't find answers
we're applying, but mcdonald's
seems to be the only franchise that'll hire
so how can we have higher standards?
as dallas overshadows the battle for black lives matter
we fight back with violence but acts like that are
black eyes on the movement
which makes black lives madder
at cops and cops madder
that's why it's at a stalemate
and can't arrive at a compromise so it's black ops
i wonder if we hire more black cops, the crap stops
the block is our backyards, officers, not the crack spot
call the attack dogs off of us, man
you always act all pissed off at us at a traffic stop
and bad cops fuck it up for the good cops, and man, stop
sendin' white cops in the black neighborhoods
who ain't acclimated to 'em, like that's the way to do it
who seen some fuckin' videos of rappers waving guns
and know nobody black so they act afraid of us
and that's racism, the fear that a black face gives 'em
a subconscious racist
wait, why are there black neighborhoods?
'cause america segregated us, designated us to an area
separated us, section-eight'd us
when we tear it up's the only time attention's paid to us
and education sucks, and every day's another
freddie gray for us, a levy breaks or fuzz
why is it they treat us like dryer lint?
we just want a safe environment for our kids
but can't escape the sirens
don't take a scientist to see our violent nature lies in
the poverty that we face so the crime rate's the highest in
the lowest classes, it's like a razor wire fence
and we're trapped in these racial biases
that plague our society which makes our anxiety levels raise
every time we see a devil's face
lions, tigers, and bears, oh my
it's more like billy clubs and gats
and we really love it when you think we're guilty ‘cause we're black
"but you kill each other, facts
you peel each other's caps, for silly stuff like hats”
single mother strugglin' through substance abuse
while people with nothin' to lose shoot each other for shoes
fuck your republican views
pull ourselves up by our bootstraps, where the fuck are the boots?
and streets act as a narrator, don't gotta read comics
or be that into characters, just to see that, just to be black
you better be strapped with a derringer
or be “capped in america” like steve rogers
'cause no one oversees these cops and
all we see is 'em beat charges
we done seen 'em beat rodney king unconscious, and got off
so we don't need all you crooked police officers' peace offerings
just keep marchin', 'til we reach congress
but they're gonna say you're tryin' to take an irrational stance
if you try to slander the flag but
somebody has to be the sacrificial lamb
so they call it a kaepernick tantrum
if you don't stand for the national anthem
we raise it, you better praise it
or you'll be made to feel like a traitor, we'll
treat you like rodney dangerfield
home of the brave is still racist 'ville
so this whole nation feels like a plantation field
in a country that claims that its foundation was based on united states ideals
that had its natives killed
got you singin' this star-spangled spiel
to a piece of cloth that represents the "land of the free" that made people slaves to build

i walk on water
but i ain't no jesus
i walk on water
but only when it freezes (fuck)


why are expectations so high? is it the bar i set?
my arms, i stretch, but i can’t reach
a far cry from it, or it's in my grasp, but as
soon as i grab, squeeze
i lose my grip like the flying trapeze
into the dark i plummet, now the sky's blackening
i know the mark’s high, butter-
​flies rip apart my stomach
knowin' that no matter what bars i come with
you're gonna harp, gripe, and
that's a hard vicodin to swallow, so i scrap these
as pressure increases like khakis
i feel the ice cracking, because—


i walk on water
but i ain't no jesus
(it's the curse of the—, it's the curse of the—)
i walk on water (shit)
but only when it freezes


it's the curse of the standard, that the first of the mathers disc set
always in search of the verse that i haven’t spit yet
will this step just be another misstep
to tarnish whatever the legacy, love or respect
i’ve garnered? the rhyme has to be perfect, the delivery flawless
and it always feels like i'm hittin’ the mark
'til i go sit in the car, listen and pick it apart
like, "this shit is garbage"
god's given me all this, still i feel no different regardless
kids look to me as a god, this is retarded
if only they knew, it's a facade and it’s exhaustive
and i try not to listen to nonsense
but if you bitches are tryin' to strip me of my confidence
mission accomplished
i'm not god-sent, nas, rakim, 'pac, b.i.g., james todd smith
and i'm not prince, so…


i walk on water
but i ain't no jesus
i walk on water
(it's true, i'm a rubik's—, it's true—)
but only when it freezes
(it's true—)


it's true, i'm a rubik's—a beautiful mess
at times juvenile, yes, i goof and i jest
a flawed human, i guess
but i'm doin' my best to not ruin your ex-
​pectations and meet 'em, but first
the "speedom" verse, now big sean
he's goin' too fast, is he gonna shout or curse out his mom?
there was a time i had the world by the balls, eatin' out my palm
every album song i was spazzin' the fuck out on
and now i'm gettin' clowned and frowned on
but the only one who's looking down on
me that matters now's deshaun
am i lucky to be around this long?
begs the question though
especially after the methadone
as yesterday fades and the dresden home
is burnt to the ground and all that's left of my house is lawn
the crowds are gone
and it's time to wash out the blonde
sales decline, the curtain's drawn
they're closin' the set, i'm still pokin' my head from out behind
and everyone who has doubt, remind
now take your best rhyme, outdo it, now do it a thousand times
now let 'em tell ya the world no longer cares
or gives a fuck about your rhymes
and as i grow outta sight, outta mind, i might go outta mine
'cause how do i ever let this mic go without a fight
when i made a fuckin' tightrope outta twine?
but when i do fall from these heights though, i'll be fine
i won't pout or cry or spiral down or whine
but i'll decide if it's my final bow this time around, 'cause—


'cause i'm just a man
but as long as i got a mic, i'm godlike
so me and you are not alike
bitch, i wrote "stan"

stan


dear slim, i wrote you, but you still ain't callin'
i left my cell, my pager and my home phone at the bottom
i sent two letters back in autumn, you must not've got 'em
there probably was a problem at the post office or somethin'
sometimes i scribble addresses too sloppy when i jot 'em
but anyways, fuck it, what's been up, man? how's your daughter?
my girlfriend's pregnant too, i'm 'bout to be a father
if i have a daughter, guess what i'ma call her?
i'ma name her bonnie
i read about your uncle ronnie too, i'm sorry
i had a friend kill himself over some bitch who didn't want him
i know you probably hear this every day, but i'm your biggest fan
i even got the underground shit that you did with skam
i got a room full of your posters and your pictures, man
i like the shit you did with rawkus too, that shit was phat
anyways, i hope you get this, man, hit me back
just to chat, truly yours, your biggest fan, this is stan


i can't tell you what it really is
i can only tell you what it feels like
and right now there's a steel knife in my windpipe
i can't breathe, but i still fight while i can fight
as long as the wrong feels right, it's like i'm in flight
high off her love, drunk from her hate
it's like i'm huffin' paint
and i love her the more i suffer, i suffocate
and right before i'm about to drown she resuscitates me
she fuckin' hates me, and i love it, “wait!
where you going?”, “i'm leaving you.” “no, you ain't
come back!” we're runnin' right back, here we go again
it's so insane, 'cause when it's goin' good it's goin' great
i'm superman with the wind at his back, she's lois lane
but when it's bad it's awful, i feel so ashamed
i snap, “who's that dude?”, i don't even know his name
i laid hands on her, i'll never stoop so low again
i guess i don't know my own strength
