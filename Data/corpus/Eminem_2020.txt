before i check the mic (check, check, one, two)
i give it a extra swipe with a lysol disinfectant wipe (good evening)
coronavirus in effect tonight
antiseptics on deck, i got every type (yeah)
i throw on my tux, then i (yeah) give zero fucks, then i (yeah)
act like a jockstrap (uh), cup my nuts, then i (yeah)
check my ball hair (what?), make sure it's all there (yeah)
then call the pallbearer (yeah)
it's music to bе murdered by again, why stop?
overkill likе a pipe bomb in your pine box
you're all hitched to my cock (what?)
went from punchin' a time clock to getting my shot
then treated it like a cyclops
like it's the only one i (only one eye) got
and my thoughts are like nines cocked (chk-chk)
every line's obscene, pervertedest mind, got the dirtiest rhyme stocked
that's why there's parental advising (visine) every time i drop (eye drop)
so throw on the theme to alfred, i'll channel him like the panama canal
but how could i get up in arms about you saying trash is all that i put out?
bitch, i still get the bag when i'm putting garbage out
plus, the potty mouth, i'm not about to wash it out
the filthiest, so all this talk about i'm washed up, how preposterous
because if cleanliness is next to godliness
it's obvious that it's impossible for me to be beside myself
and i'm 'bout that capital like a proper noun
still on top the pile
got me sitting on numbers like a pocket dial
quick to call you out on your bullshit
don't make me give that crock a dial
'cause if i do it, see you later, alligator
made it out the trailer, then i made a vow to cater to no one
so hate, i've gained about the same amount that's in my bank account
so here's some more shit for you to complain about, i say the
bars that never slack (yeah), but always get attacked (yeah)
i think they're gunnin' for me, it's startin' to feel like that
like i'm marked, 'cause when i rap, it's like fallin' on my back in a tar pit
'cause i have this target on my back (ew, yuck)
but if i ever double-crossed my fans and lost my stans
i'd probably pop five xans (yeah)
go in my garage, start my van
inhale as much carbon monoxide and exhaust i can
and doze off like *snores*
but odds like that, with these thoughts i have's like a giant getting squashed by ants
if this is the test of time, i'd pass with flying colors
like i just tossed my crayons (tossed my crayons)
small, medium, and large size cans
sanitizers of all types, brands, cost nine bands
which is a small price for lysol wipes and
if my palms brush across my pants, i wash my hands


shit, hold on, man
motherfuck
happy birthday to—
fuck (shh, quiet)


i sit in silence in candlelit environments
sipping wild irish while getting violent
homicidal visions when i'm spitting like this
but really i'm just fulfilling my wish of killing rhymes
which is really childish and silly, but i'm really like this
i'm giving nightmares to billie eilish, i'm diddy's side bitch


what the fuck? hold on, wait
"i'm diddy's side bitch?"
oh, i'm still east side, bitch


so 'til the e-n-d, since epmd
been givin' y'all the business (yeah), d-r-e and me (yup)
from the mmlp to (huh?) mtbmb (bitch)
bitch, it's 2020, you still ain't seein' me (haha)
so call me santa claus (santa claus)
'cause at the present (yeah), i out-rap 'em all (wrap 'em all), i'm at the mall
got your bitch in a bathroom stall, she could suck a basketball (uh)
through a plastic straw (yeah) with a fractured jaw (damn)
my dick is coat check (ha), she wanna jack it off (yeah)
i'm so far past the bar, i should practice law
mentally, i'm fucked up generally (general lee) (duh)
dukes of hazzard car (yeah), get the cadaver dogs
'cause this is murder, murder and you'll get murked, murked
this music 'bout to kill you, brr, brr (brr)
this chicken hit my phone, she said, "chirp, chirp"
i said, "hut, hut, hike your skirt, skirt"
then go eat some worms, like the early bird
what the fuck is love? that's a dirty word
make me fall in it, there's not a girl on earth
or any other planet, that's a world of hurt
and i won't buy her designer, 'cause i don't pander (panda)
but i'm back with so many knots, i need a chiropractor (damn)
and this the final chapter (why?), 'cause i'm either frying after (oh)
or they gon' give me the needle (what?) like a vinyl scratcher (dj)
yeah, i'm a card, like hallmark
at walmart with a small cart buying wall art
and y'all who claim to be dogs aren't
no bite, like a tree, mostly just all bark, arf, arf
but y'all pickin' the wrong tree, they call me dog because i'm barking (bar king, bark, bark, barking)
and i got a lot, yeah, like where cars park
i'd describe it as bowling (why?) ball hard (ball's hard)
'cause the gutter's where my mind is and when
it's in this frame, better split like the five and the ten
'cause without a second to spare, i'm strikin' again
and when the beat is up my alley, i go right for the pens (pins)
the cypher begins
i'm talkin' smack like heroin, the mic's a syringe
it's like a binge, vicodin, i would liken to tin
my mind is a recycling bin
there's no place i never been
but i never budge and i never bend
you hyperextend on me, this game's life, it depends
like adult diapers for men
even when i'm rappin' less stellar
it's sour grapes, i still whine, i'm the best seller (cellar)
like a trey deuce, spray you as these shots penetrate through dre's booth
and go straight through your grapefruit, no escape route
so you won't leave here just scathed with a few scrape wounds
your ass is grass and i am not gonna graze you
but if bars were semi-mac's, i'd be the mad hatter
'cause i got so many caps, and you don't have any straps (nah)
so you'd be a fitted (yeah), so don't act like you fittin' to snap
bitch, i'll pee (p) on your head like a phillies hat (haha)
no stoppin' me, you're on a window shopping spree
bitch, you probably go broke at the dollar tree
you never buy shit, all you ever cop's a plea
you're always punkin' out like halloween
you rather opt to flee, you need to stop it, punk
homie, you're not a g, act like you got the pump
and you're gonna cock the heat or get the glock and dump
bitch, if you shot a tree, you wouldn't pop the trunk
yeah, and i'm buddies with alfred, we about to
disembowel them, gut 'em and scalp 'em, yeah
this is 'bout to be the bloodiest outcome
'cause we gon' make you bleed with every cut from this album
so i'm choppin' 'em up like dahmer
the nut job with the nuts that are bigger than jabba the hutt
i'm in the cut, and i'm out for the blood
it's lookin' like it's that time of the month
carvin' 'em up with the bars while i sharpen 'em up, dog and a mutt
i'm gonna fuck your mom in the butt with a thermometer, fuckin' phenomenal, but
y'all will get cut the fuck up like abdominals if you don't vámonos
i keep droppin' like dominos, the formidable, abominable
stompin' a mudhole in my comp even if it's off the top of the dome
son 'em, get the coppertone, i'm at the stop and go coppin' the mop and glo
got your stomach in knots like you swallowed rope
you out of pocket though, like a motherfuckin' wallet stole


wait, why'd the beat cut off?
fuck it

i don't smile, i don't frown, get too up or get too down (nah)
i was here, so were you, you came and went, i stuck around (yeah)
still here now, stop me how? your opinion's like a broken calculator
that shit doesn't count
shut your motherfuckin' mouth


i'm emptyin' (i'm emptyin') my book of rhymes (my book of rhymes)
get 'em all off my pad, every thought that i had
i said i'm emptyin' (i'm emptyin') my book of rhymes (my book of rhymes)
get 'em all off my pad (yeah), every thought that i had (i'm eastside)


haven't used all the tricks i have, so like my balls, i'm in my bag (my bag)
get a littlе teste when i'm mad (i'm mad), sick of wrеstling this ipad (ipad)
unsuccessfully, i might add (might add)
and i know it's best to leave it lie
but even i get obsessed with reading everything
and let it get the best of me 'til i snap ('til i snap)
but i need to get off the internet (get off the internet)
i need to get on the mic (get on the mic)
you need to get off the internet (internet)
you need to get you a life
why you waste time just to comment on shit? (comment on shit)
especially shit you don't like (shit you don't like)
don't like it, don't listen, but don't tell me 'bout your favorite rapper rippin' some shit he didn't write (shit he didn't write)
what happened to slim? he was no cap with the pen
he used to rap like the people his music was for
he was exactly like them
the dude who used to be poor, why can't he tap into him?
can't use that excuse anymore
he's mad at the wind, he's in a nuclear war
with a cloud, he's yellin' at it again
i talked to your mother, she told me she loved me
all she wanna do is just hold me and hug me
wants nobody but me, she showed me the dougie
can i get a witness like notary public? (preach)
she said, "kick some fly shit" (fly shit)
i said, "i got wings on my ass" (wings on my ass)
told her my dick's a cockpit (dick's a cockpit)
i fly by the seat of my pants (seat of my pants)
sinful thoughts, this beat is crazy, this shit's retarded
this instru's mental (this instru's mental) to mini-bars, incidental charges
when did it start? i been cold-hearted in this heart since kindergarten
mental sharpness which makes slim a walking dentist office, bitch, i invented flossin'
yeah, i used to wonder (i used to wonder) where my next meal's gonna come from (meal's gonna come from)
now, i just wonder (now i just wonder) where my next mill's gonna come from (mill's gonna come from)
i cannot have no success (have no success), unless when i finally make it (finally make it)
i get to remind all the haters (remind all the haters) who shitted on me when i'm on my way up (i'm on my way)
my floor is y'all fool's ceilings
if i was you, i would step or find yourself twisted
that's how you'll wind up like spiral stairs
i will swear on a stack of bibles
i will tear new behinds out of rivals, even your idols, i don't care
it's music to be murdered by, so bon iver can swallow a fuckin' ja rule bobblehead
and die slow like alzheimer's (ha-ha)
lone sniper, i hold a microphone like a loaded rifle
my dome's brighter, all i spit from my skull's fire
all that's missing's a motorcycle with the chrome wires, spoke tires
and y'all are flow biters, so i don't gotta
explain why they call me your ghostwriter


i'm emptyin' (i'm emptyin') my book of rhymes (my book of rhymes)
get 'em all off my pad, every thought that i had
i said i'm emptyin' (i'm emptyin') my book of rhymes (my book of rhymes)
get 'em all off my pad, every thought that i had (illa)


haven't used all the tricks i have, so like my balls, it's in my bag
i tend to get a little testy when i'm mad
but gift of gab and pen to pad turn temper tantrums into anthems
put lips to ass and kiss the cracks, spit your damnedest
you're still gonna hit the canvas
rippin' rappers, veterans to whippersnappers
mr. mathers is killin' this shit, villainous wit with scant less
syllables rip the planet, biblical shit's finna hit the fan
anybody wanna go tit for tat's gonna get hit with that
then the amygdala hippocampus is gonna trigger the ignoramus
to think of the most ridiculous shit to spit then
pit it against these pitiful rappers
insidious, these idiots wittiest shit against me shitty as mc hammer's
get your whole squad, send a task force in
if you want it, you're 'bout to get what you asked for then
put your helmet on, strap your chin
you're 'bout to get you a crash course in
who not to start a motherfuckin' rap war with
or to go against, fuck would you wanna do that for?
no offense, but are you retards slow or dense?
a fuckin' penny has more sense
yeah, now you gotta get killed, but it's not a big deal, but every thought is so ill
and so methodical, thought i swallowed a pill
i'm starting to feel like i'm an automobile
with barnacle bill inside the car at the wheel
inside a carnival, 'cause i'm plowin' into everyone who wrote snidey articles
and that explains why the fuck you clowns are all in my grill
joy and pain, fortune, fame, torture, shame, choice i made
swore someday the world would pay less to lose, more to gain, daughters raised
yesterday, glory days, adored and praised, ignored the hate
addressed the fake, toured with dre, tore a page from jordan came
destroyed the game before you came, enjoy your stay
before it's gone away, but the more you claim that you're gonna point and aim
if it joined a gang, your shit isn't going to bang
you're just boring, lame and more of the same
you have an enormous chain, but a stormless brain
the most you can form is rain
your shit is pointless, same as a scoreless game
so, bitch, quit lyin', you're denyin' like mr. porter's name (haha)
borderline bipolar disorder since my stroller
eyes rollin' back in my skull like eli porter
fire mortar (brr) rounds, ayatollah, every iota i load up
i owe to my motor mouth
this is my note to self
sometimes you're gonna bomb
so you just might have to blow yourself up with no one's help
i just wrote it down in my book of rhymes
preemo, take us out


writin' in my book of rhymes
my book of rhymes, my book of rhymes
i'm, i'm, i'm, i'm, i'm, i'm, i'm eastside
writin' in my book of rhymes
my book of rhymes, my book of rhymes
i'm, i'm, i'm, i'm, i'm, i'm, i'm, i'm, i'm eastside

i don't wanna be alone, i don't wanna be


i don't wanna be alone in the darkness
i don't wanna be alone in the darkness
i don't wanna be alone in the darkness anymore
(hello, darkness, my old friend)


here i am, alone again
can't get out of this hole i'm in
it's like the walls are closin' in
you can't help me, no one can
i can feel these curtains closin'
i go to open 'em
but something pulls 'em closed again
(hello, darkness, my old friend)
feels like i'm loathing in las vegas
haven't got the vaguest why i'm so lost
but i'd make you this small wager
if i bet you i'll be in tomorrow's paper
who would the odds favor?
(hello, darkness, my old friend)
i'm so much like my father, you would think that i knew him
i keep pacin' this room, valium, then chase it with booze
one little taste, it'll do
maybe i'll take it and snooze, then tear up the stage in a few
(hello, darkness, my old friend)
fuck the colt 45, i'ma need somethin' stronger
if i pop any caps, it better be off of vodka
round after round after round, i'm gettin' loaded (haha)
that's a lot of shots, huh? (double entendre)
(hello, darkness, my old friend)


and i don't wanna be alone in the darkness (yeah)
i don't wanna be alone in the darkness
i don't wanna be alone in the darkness anymore
(hello, darkness, my old friend)


now i'm starin' at the room service menu off a benzo
i can hear the music continue to crescendo
i can see the whole fuckin' venue from my window
that's when you know you're schizo
(hello, darkness, my old friend)
'cause i keep peekin' out the curtain from the hotel
the music is so loud
but it's almost as though i don't hear no sound
i should get ready for the show now
wait, is this the whole crowd? i thought this shit was sold out
(hello, darkness, my old friend)
but it's only the opening act, it's early, don't overreact
then something told me relax
and just hope for the show to be packed
don't wanna hit the stage before they fill each row to the max
'cause that'd be totally wack
you can't murder a show nobody's at
(hello, darkness, my old friend)
but what if nobody shows? panic mode
'bout to snap and go motherfuckin' wacko at any second
'bout to cancel the show just as fans below rush the entrance
plan is a go to wreck shit, cameras in all directions
(hello, darkness, my old friend)
the press is 'bout to go ape shit, bananas on all the networks
commando with extra clips, i got ammo for all the hecklers
i'm armed to the teeth, another valium, fall off the bed
hit the ground and crawl to the dresser
alcohol on my breath as i reach for the scope
(hello darkness, my old friend)
i'm blackin' out, i'm all out of meds
with them benzodiazepines gone
now it's just magazines sprawled out on the floor
fuck the media, i'm goin' all out, this is war
(hello, darkness, my old friend)


and i don't wanna be alone in the darkness (yeah)
i don't wanna be alone in the darkness
i don't wanna be alone in the darkness anymore
(hello, darkness, my old friend)


people start to show up, time to start the show up
it's 10:05 pm and the curtain starts to go up
and i'm already sweatin', but i'm locked and loaded
for rapid fire spittin' for all the concert-goers
scopes for sniper vision, surprise from out of nowhere
as i slide the clip in from inside the hotel
leanin' out the window, going keyser söze
finger on the trigger, but i'm a licensed owner
with no prior convictions, so law says sky's the limit
so my supply's infinite, strapped like i'm a soldier
got 'em hopping over walls and climbing fences
some of them john travolta, staying alive by inches
(hello, darkness, my old friend)
cops are knockin', oh fuck, thought i blocked the entrance
guess show time is over
no suicide note, just a note for target distance
but if you'd like to know the reason why i did this
you'll never find a motive, truth is i have no idea
i am just as stumped, no signs of mental illness
just tryin' to show ya the reason why we're so fucked
'cause by the time it's over, won't make the slightest difference
(hello, darkness, my old friend)


and i don't wanna be alone in the darkness
i don't wanna be alone in the darkness
i don't wanna be alone in the darkness anymore
(hello, darkness, my old friend)

piss you off, my lady, what i really meant to say is
it goes a little something like this


soon as i'm through with the unisom i'ma hit the snooze alarm
before i lose my mind, who am i gonna use it on?
utilizing this tool, i will execute a line
like what i tried to do one time in my youth when i euthanized
my poodle in junior high, used to hide in my room and fly
to the moon and try suicide with the glue from my school supplies
then proof, denaun
eye-kyu and i would climb in that hooptie to ride to 'drew's and rhyme
bodied saint andrew's hall too many times to count
before i tear up the shelter, give my dawgs a pound
now i'm 'bout to treat all of you rappers' noggins how
dre does every time he goes back to compton now
'cause every so often i'll visit my old stomping grounds
and doc's in the house, so you know the bong is out
room is spinning like nine-hundred-thousand miles an hour
forgot what i'm talkin' 'bout, fuck, i'm discombobulated


now up is down, left is right
day is night now, in is out, black is white
so to-and-fro and side-to-side

'cause back is forth now and stop means go
no means yes, but yes don't mean no
so, baby, please, take off your clothes
(no!) yes! (no!) yes! (no!) no! (yes!) oh! (oh!), yeah


just flew the coop, the cops are in hot pursuit
but the day they catch me is the day 50'll call a truce
and quash the feud with him and ja and ja'll actually spit a bar

shout to trugoy, gotta give a de la salute
'cause my noodle's in a knot, call it pasta noose (posdnuos, yeah)
wizard of ah's (oz) and ooh's
same marshall bruce in that battle who lost to juice
who also used to sound like nas on "live at the barbeque"
now i got the juice, wouldn't beef if i was you
like, au jus, but beef, if like
"i was you," but, like, ah, fuck you (man)
long as i got these walls and these hallways i'm always
have someone to argue with, i'm just all twisted, i'm discombobulated, man


now up is down, left is right
day is night now, in is out, black is white
so to-and-fro and side-to-side
am i comin' or goin'? man, i can't decide
'cause back is forth now and stop means go
no means yes, but yes don't mean no
so, baby, please, take off your clothes
(no!) yes! (no!) yes! (no!) no! (yes!) oh! (oh!)


i'm at my best when i'm at my worst
and for that i'm blessed, so every time i rap i curse
and that's why press, i usually get attacked by first
they're at my neck like motherfucking vampires
so critics si-day i si-day the same shi-dit, i'm always degrading, little bi-ditch
well, fi-duck 'em, they can si-duck my di-dick when i'm taking a shi-dit
mid-y middle fid-inger is ex-tid-ended now, should i tell 'em where to put it?
i'm si-do fed up with it, they ask me dumb shi-dit
so i act like i'm on a kayak with my back to niagara
no life jacket, man, i had like six psychiatrists, scientists
misdiagnose me with plaque psoriasis 'cause i asked 'em, "why is it
my eye itches?" so they gave me some diet tips
and viagra with side effects, i might end up growing spiderwebs
in my head and dying a horrifying death, on my final breath
i will tell you, apply your lips to my dick, it's one size that fits
i just took an aids test and the doctor said to think positive, what the fuck?


now up is down, left is right
day is night now, in is out, black is white
so to-and-fro and side-to-side
am i comin' or goin'? man, i can't decide
'cause back is forth now and stop means go

2050, haha
we're out

ricky racks
for what it's worth
you were a slut at birth
if the world had a dick
you'd fuck the earth
i tried to get over you
it doesn't work
you're still a cunt
i'm still a fucking jerk


same as it ever was, yeah
say it'll change but it never does
ain't gonna ever 'cause
you're the cause of my pain and the medicine
never met someone who played games with my head as much
fate tethered us together like two felons
must've fell in love with skeletons
everyone's got 'em, thought that you were cinderella but (yeah)
feels like i slept with the (uh) wicked stepmother
but how the hell am i
still in love with the motherfucking chick there's at least a million of?
they say love the one you with
but this shit is killing us
our love's on some other shit
i'm a glutton for punishment
you're the gloves, i'm the punching mitts
it's above and beyond us
cuffing, i'm shoving the girl i love inside of an oven
if i catch you sucking another dick
you better unsuck it, you snuck in the crib and tried to jump under the covers again
why am i tucking you in?
probably 'cause


i gotta tell myself another lie
'cause that's what helps to get me by
'cause i'm in hell
this is my goodbye, farewell


wanna hold you, wanna choke you, wanna love you
wanna hate you, wanna kill you, wanna hurt you
wanna heal you, yeah
wanna lose you, keep you, bruise you
beat, abuse you, treat you mutual
it's juvenile, delusional, as usual
you're beautiful, i'm average (woo)
i'm brutal, you're a savage
my ride or die chick who's always cruising for a bruising
yeah, it's kinda like we're tryna light a dynamite stick
though we might get along like shit
fight, hit, bite, spit, unite, split
yeah, you're awful, but you're mine
and they say love is blind, we see each other fine
but it's no wonder i'm (yeah) the only one you'll find (uh)
to put up with your shit (what?), i need a plumber line (yeah)
but nothing comes to mind (nah) besides the number 90 (no)
'cause since '06 you flipped my fucking life, upside down
now the sky's ground, look at my frown, it's a smile now
look at my mouth, it's my eyebrows, make it rain upwards
we're on that ninth cloud, two insane lovebirds
i should fly south, 'cause man am i great, ain't lyin' to myself
but i'm just plain stubborn, i'm audi five thou'
but this is my house, bitch, you get out
then we duke it out, then it dies down
then we say, "fuck it", cry our eyes out
then...


i gotta tell myself another lie
'cause that's what helps to get me by
'cause i'm in hell
this is my goodbye, farewell


this relationship is all that it's cracked up to be
never lack lust in that 'cause we act nuts
'cause that's what attracts us
trick you with a back rub
tell you to relax then dump your ass in the bathtub (haha)
yeah, now that's love, may sound pathetic
but fuck the world 'cause they out to get us
i love you but i won't exchange vows
hey now, don't get carried away
no way i'll get married, it'll take a rain cloud to wed us
yeah, but we're so insane ‘bout each other
may take the same route and way out as junior seau
break out berettas, lay down in bed and blow our brains out together
who knows how it's gonna play out?
or whether death's what our ending will be
one of us shot in the back while attempting to flee
but i'll go to bat for you, defending your honor
yeah, no contingency fees, something we’re not, nah
we're not pretending to beef, don't cost a penny to be with me
time we're spending is free, we could be broke as a joke
won't make a difference to me, don't have to give me a thing
could've been a 50 cent ring from out of a vending machine
love unconditionally, there's no other fish in the sea
guess i'm a prisoner, see, addiction is a disease


i gotta tell myself another lie
'cause that's what helps to get me by
'cause i'm in hell
this is my goodbye, farewell


love you girl, do you feel the same?
i don't wanna play games, no games, ah
you're the only one that can out my flame
baby, just play it straight, straight, no games, ah

nah, for real, you know what i'm sayin'? like
like music's my first love, right?
but what it turned into is like
you know, these, these cats got it now, she just like a ho
(they ain't doin' like blacknailz do it)
you know what i mean? (yeah)
it's not real (yeah)
switched it up, then everybody—
done changed the shit on that damn—
yeah, everybody done ran through it
mumble rappin'
ain't no more substance in shit
right, right
they don't treat it the way it needs to be treated
i kinda want that old thing back


yeah, i was young, i was hungry
i was chasin' the bag at twenty-one, i was lucky
to find an unеaten fucking (what?) honeybun i forgot about
now i got money fallin' out, fiftiеs, hundreds, and twenties (twenties)
and i know nothing is funny 'bout the manchester bombing
but we got something in common (what?), both of us are alarming
foul, disgusting, and awful (yeah), so repugnant and ugly (yup)
i could give the boston marathon a run for its money, yeah
and you could say i'm a little bit immature
but this type of literature got me a little richer
but i get insecure when them other dudes hit on you, girl
you're letting 'em fiddle with your clitoris
remember you were my fucking—


always hated my smile
mama told me it's goofy
i'd get picked on at school
come home and she'd school me
she never sugarcoated it to me
she said if i wasn't so stupid and ugly, i wouldn't always get bullied (true)
i think of my struggles (yeah) and get emotional
could be 'cause how behind the eight-ball and far in the hole that they put me
now i'm on a roll like a tootsie (yeah)
i'm just trollin' you pussies
but i'm like a stroller 'cause you'll see just how i roll if you push me
but that's what i do this music for
when i was goin' through some of the hardest times, i drew from her
but she's like the devil 'cause i just can't let loose of her (lucifer)
'cause the thought of losin' her makes me wanna just let loose on her
then i hit the studio, tryna rendezvous with her
tell her, "it's a butt-dial girl," yeah, booty call (haha)
that's how it used to be, 'cause you and me, we ruled the world
and we made curtis blow (kurtis blow, 50)
fuck, i miss them days


you fuckin' leavin' me, bitch?
i don't think so, sit your motherfuckin' ass down
i swear to god, you run to that door
i'ma put one in the back of your fuckin' head
now i'ma ask you this one time
and your answer better be "yes"


would you marry me again
now that everything has changed? (yeah)
it'll never be the same (nah)
as the era whence we came (who?)
from nas to pac, ra (yeah), eric b. and kane (i know)
but i know a few from this era that are lyrically insane
and although most are never gonna hit the level cole or weezy at
or be emotionally attached to yo! mtv raps (yeah)
runnin' home from school to catch an episode, the feeling that
it gave you to rip the plastic off the tape you're holdin'
peel it back, yeah, tear it off, and play it (what?)
and swear to god, four o'clock
we'd crowd around the tv, butter in his underwear and socks
when naunie was kon artis (yeah) and proof had his hair in locs (doody)
yeah, back when flavor flav had us wearin' clocks
(back with) back with ed lover (yeah)
and there was two dr. dre's, that's a paradox (pair of docs)
but i never thought i'd get so jealous
at the thought of letting you go psychologically
it's gonna bother me, my eyes are already watery
part of me don't wanna stop (yeah) 'til i get you back
if i gotta put the work in and tell you i'm never givin' this up
other part wants to tell you just to get fucked
go back to whatever dick that you sucked (ah)
get back together with them, you slut
givin' up the vagina like a trip to the gynecologist
when i helped you become bigger than you were
but i guess that it slipped your mind, you must be biding your time
looking for someone to come along that'll make you feel like i did back when you were mine, huh? (damn)
but truthfully, it was never really you and me exclusively
and there's too many new mc's you can choose between
but no matter how many motherfuckers ran through it, they can't do it like me
but i can't keep burnin' the candle at both ends
and i can't handle it when i leave and you find another one
now i gotta take this beat and dismantle it
i won't grieve when i kill you
but if i can't have you, bitch, nobody can
can't believe i used to be your favorite, bitch

yeah, yeah, sick
(d.a. got that dope)


they say these bars are like covid (bars are like covid; what?)
you get 'em right off the bat (you get 'em right off the bat; yeah)
infected with sars and corona (infected with sars and corona)
like you took a bite off of that (you took a bite off of that; damn)
and it goes from martian to human (from martian to human; yeah)
that's how the virus attacks (that's how the virus attacks)
they come at me with machine guns (at me with machine guns; brr)
like trying to fight off a gnat

still stackin' my chips, hoes
higher than shaq on his tiptoes
atop the empire state buildin'
this shit is like child's play, childrеn
i will anni-nihilate, kill them
i'll fuck around and pile еight million
dead little juveniles, wait, chill, then
i'll await my trial date 'til then (what?)
ain't nothin' you say could ever trump (nah), mic, pencil get killed (yeah)
if you're hypersensitive, i wasn't referencin' the vice president, chill (chill)
i mean my penmanship at times tends to get ill, violence but with skill
that's why i hence when i write ends up with the mic and pencil gettin' killed (haha, yeah, hold up)
and i'm still ride or die for the squad (yeah)
so you know which side that i'm on
if a battle line's ever drawn, but if i get involved
it'll be like k9's in a brawl
but not similar to mike vick at all
'cause even if i don't have a dog in the fight
they ain't never gonna get rid of the fight in the dog (fight in the dog)
got stripes like a tiger, so you might get mauled, a mic in the palms
like claws, i can swing right for your jaw
and rip it off with one swipe of the paw
bitch, you still on my dick or nah? (nah)
if i suck, your wife is a straw (straw)
i'm sick and i'm not gonna cover my mouth next time that i cough 'cause


they say these bars are like covid (bars are like covid; what?)
you get 'em right off the bat (you get 'em right off the bat; yeah)
infected with sars and corona (infected with sars and corona)
like you took a bite off of that (you took a bite off of that; damn)
and it goes from martian to human (from martian to human; yeah)
that's how the virus attacks (that's how the virus attacks)
they come at me with machine guns (at me with machine guns; brr)
like trying to fight off a gnat (like trying to fight off a gnat; yeah, yeah)


and d.a. got that dope he sends to me (uh-huh)
it's like pneumonia symptoms and contracting covid instantly
which is what separates my flow from theirs
so that no one gets even close to this to pose a risk to me
so vocalistically (what?), that's social distancing (yeah)
flow going viral, you best stay strapped
with that lysol and get way back (shh)
get that pine-sol and that ajax
'cause this dry cough is just like football umpires callin' a playback
bitch, back the fuck up like fifteen yards, these rhymes call for a face mask (face mask)
'nother fourteen-day quarantine, they're cordoning off everything
this shit lookin' like a horror scene, like me metaphorically (damn)
'cause them stay-at-home orders seem
like they just keep getting more extreme
who knows when this nightmare will end (marilyn)? like monroe, norma jean (norma jean)
still got that heroin lyrical drip with that morphine and that thorazine
'cause i'm so fuckin' dope (dope) and you're a fiend
and that's the one thing that hasn't changed (nope)
for some semblance of normalcy
but i might need that hydrochloroquine 'cause i got that (yeah)
the dark horse, i'm a knight-mare
mom fed me valium like air (mmm)
thought that's why they called it a high chair (woah)
i got a contact like eyewear (woah)
wait a minute, bitch, let me lie here (uh)
20/20 hindsight in my side mirror
every year, you drop the ball like times square
my hair trigger whenever i get an idea's
like, fuck, now my name rings out like a sponge mop
and my drip was a drop
in the bucket, so that gun shot
you just heard just now in that one spot
just came from the nine mil' that i just got
that's big bucks and i got a full money clip and i'm loaded
i ain't even mean to go the fuck off
and i'm still totally inappropriate with an opiate
groping it while i'm holding it like a trophy
i'm hoping a little codeine'll get me od'in'
woah, everything is slow, i begin to floating
i know that i'm getting loaded, the pen exploded
hiroshima with the flows, a utopia
with the dope, i'm an og, i'm like the g.o.a.t.​
here to get your goat little bit of sodium, it's assault (a salt)
when i'm at the podium, at your throat, holy camoly
i'm in the zone with the shit i'm on
get imodium and a commode because nobody's even close
you're petroleum to plutonium, you're a phony
i'm at the crib with your ho
got her at the pole like voting with no clothing
stripped down to a toe ring and here we go with the gloating
i've got my nose in the air like a boeing
then i got into a little bit of an argument with her
so i took a little lick of a klonopin at dinner
then i hit her with the motherfucking ottoman and bit her
then i shot her in the liver, delivered her to the bottom of the river (dope)
but i'm probably gon' jump in the water with her
with a wad of money 'cause i got a lot of it
and when it come to drippin', i be soppin' like a hundred mile an hour
never runnin' out of either one of 'em, i gotta get it 'cause


they say these bars are like covid (bars are like covid; what?)
you get 'em right off the bat (you get 'em right off the bat; yeah)
infected with sars and corona (infected with sars and corona)
like you took a bite off of that (you took a bite off of that; damn)
and it goes from martian to human (from martian to human; yeah)
that's how the virus attacks (that's how the virus attacks)
they come at me with machine guns (at me with machine guns; brr)
it's like trying to fight off a gnat (fight off a gnat)

ugh, you're a monster


i can swallow a bottle of alcohol and i'll feel like godzilla
better hit the deck like the card dealer
my whole squad's in here, walking around the party
a cross between a zombie apocalypse and b-bobby "the
brain" heenan which is probably the
same reason i wrestle with mania
shady's in this bitch, i'm posse'd up
consider it to cross me a costly mistake
if they sleepin' on me, the hoes better get insomnia
adhd, hydroxycut
pass the courvoisier (hey, hey)
in aa with an ak, melee, finna set it like a playdate
better vacate, retreat like a vacay, mayday (ayy)
this beat is cray-cray, ray j, h-a-h-a-h-a
laughing all the way to the bank, i spray flames
they cannot tame or placate the


monster
you get in my way, i'ma feed you to the monster (yeah)
i'm normal during the day, but at night, turn to a monster (yeah)
when the moon shines like ice road truckers
i look like a villain outta those blockbusters
godzilla, fire spitter, monster
blood on the dance floor, and on the louis v carpet
fire, godzilla, fire, monster
blood on the dance floor, and on the louis v carpet


i'm just a product of slick rick and onyx, told 'em lick the balls
had 'em just appalled, did so many things that pissed 'em off
it's impossible to list 'em all
and in the midst of all this
i'm in a mental hospital with a crystal ball
tryna see, will i still be like this tomorrow?
risperdal, voices whisper
my fist is balled back up against the wall, pencil drawn
this is just the song to go ballistic on
you just pulled a pistol on the guy with a missile launcher
i'm just a loch ness, the mythological
quick to tell a bitch screw off like a fifth of vodka
when you twist the top of the bottle, i'm a


monster
you get in my way, i'ma feed you to the monster (yeah)
i'm normal during the day, but at night, turn to a monster (yeah)
when the moon shines like ice road truckers
i look like a villain outta those blockbusters
godzilla, fire spitter, monster
blood on the dance floor, and on the louis v carpet
fire, godzilla, fire, monster
blood on the dance floor, and on the louis v carpet


if you never gave a damn (ayy), raise your hand
'cause i'm about to set trip, vacation plans
i'm on point like my index is, so all you will ever get is
the motherfuckin' finger (finger), prostate exam ('xam)
how can i have all these fans and perspire?
like a liar's pants, i'm on fire
and i got no plans to retire and i'm still the man you admire
these chicks are spazzin' out, i only get more handsome and flyer
i got 'em passin' out like what you do when you hand someone flyers
and what goes around comes around just like the blades on the chainsaw
'cause i caught the flack, but my dollars stacked right off the bat like a baseball
like kid ink, bitch, i got them racks with so much ease that they call me diddy
'cause i make bands and i call getting cheese a cakewalk (cheesecake, yeah)
bitch, i'm a player, i'm too motherfuckin' stingy for cher
won't even lend you an ear, ain't even pretending to care
but i tell a bitch i'll marry her if she'll bury her
face in my genital area, the original richard ramirez
cristhian rivera, 'cause my lyrics never sit well
so they wanna give me the chair
like a paraplegic, and it's scary, call it hari kari
'cause e'ry tom and dick and harry carry a merriam motherfuckin' dictionary on 'em
swearing up and down they can spit, this shit's hilarious
it's time to put these bitches in the obituary column
we wouldn't see eye to eye with a staring problem
get the shaft like a steering column (monster)
trigger happy, pack heat, but it's black ink
evil half of the bad meets
evil, that means take a back seat
take it back to fat beats with a maxi single
look at my rap sheet, what attracts these people
is my 'gangsta bitch' like apache with a catchy jingle
i stack chips, you barely got a half-eaten cheeto
fill 'em with the venom and eliminate 'em
other words, i minute maid 'em
i don't wanna hurt 'em, but i did, i'm in a fit of rage
i'm murderin' again, nobody will evade
i'm finna kill 'em and dump all their fuckin' bodies in the lake
obliterating everything, incinerate a renegade
i'm here to make anybody who want it with the pen afraid
but don't nobody want it, but they're gonna get it anyway
'cause i'm beginnin' to feel like i'm mentally ill
i'm attila, kill or be killed, i'm a killer bee, the vanilla gorilla
you're bringin' the killer within me outta me
you don't wanna be the enemy of the demon who entered me
and be on the receivin' end of me, what stupidity it'd be
every bit of me's the epitome of a spitter
when i'm in the vicinity, motherfucker, you better duck
or you finna be dead the minute you run into me
a hundred percent of you is a fifth of a percent of me
i'm 'bout to fuckin' finish you, bitch, i'm unfadable
you wanna battle, i'm available, i'm blowin' up like an inflatable
i'm undebatable, i'm unavoidable, i'm unevadable
i'm on the toilet bowl, i got a trailer full of money and i'm paid in full
i'm not afraid to pull a—


man, stop
look what i'm plannin', haha

yeah
you know, i've been around for a while now
not sure if i have much left to prove
yeah i do, haha


i look at me now, i'm thinkin', "damn"
how proud of me i am
what i did is nothin' to sneeze at
even if your allergies are bad
i'm up in a balcony in france
i look around, i see the fans
how they surround me in the stands
probably could drown in a sea of hands
they're hollerin', "shady" ("shady")
yelling it out to me and that's what i mean when i say
that one day someway, somehow, if i get the chance to get a crowd
i'd flip it around and have a crowd give me the chants
(i've done it all, man)
but in actuality, i haven't, yet


where am i supposed to go from here? (woah-oh-oh) hey
really i have no idea (all)
all i know is every time i think i hit my ceiling (yeah, oh)
i go higher than i've ever fuckin' been (my only question is)
where am i supposed to go from here? (woah-oh-oh) hey
really i have no idea (all i know is, all)
all i know is every time i think i hit my ceiling (yeah, oh)
i go higher than i've ever fuckin' been


got no time for no haters in this bitch
or toleration for this shit
but like medication, my dedication
and the time it takes to do this shit
reminds me of how an overcrowded hospital waiting room'll get
what i mean is maybe i have more patience (patients) than i'm able to admit
yeah, but i'm still mentally stable as a three-legged table in this bitch
fame was a switch, but i was grateful to trade this shit for the trailer with a hitch
that it would make me a raving lunatic
but i made it through my situation, i hit pay dirt
now i get paper like a stapler in this bitch
but just 'cause i made a little bit of change
don't mean i've changed a little bit
brain full of wit, dangerous, can't extinguish this english language when it's lit
and i'm just berating you with it, it's shady 'til i'm eighty-two
i'll spit this crazy, even dre, he knows (nose) i'ma blow
better get the handkerchief again, haha


where am i supposed to go from here? (woah-oh-oh) hey
really i have no idea (all)
all i know is every time i think i hit my ceiling (yeah, oh)
i go higher than i've ever fuckin' been (know i talk about this shit a lot, my only question is)
where am i supposed to go from here? (woah-oh-oh) hey
really i have no idea (all i know is, all)
all i know is every time i think i hit my ceiling (yeah, oh)
i go higher than i've ever fuckin' been


oh, now what am i gonna do?
can't nothing hold me, i'm on the loose
born a winner, damn, it's so hard to lose
i can do it even when i'm tryin' to
when my record flops, it still go through the roof
this atmosphere's for a chosen few
who was on they grind makin' money moves
and you ain't gon' get there if you watered-down
you gotta take shots with a hundred proof (check it out)


been in survival mode
since a five year old, it was i alone
since my trike was stole, spiral notebook and microphone
but lookin' back how bad it was then
if it hadn't been for the pad and the pen
addict mom and deadbeat dad
i wouldn't have had the savage within
havin' to win every single battle i'm in
all i ever wanted was to be an emcee
tediously i wrote obediently, believing in me
epmd must've had teachin' degrees
learned to defeat enemies with the ink, thinkin' of these rhymes
would be as eazy as e
and graffiti would be like remedial readin' to me (yeah)
'til my last breath leaves my lungs
i'ma beat my drum (yeah) for the streets i'm from (yeah)
the east side slums (yeah), gotta remind 'em (yeah)
i'll take a foe out (yeah), like fee-fi-fum
you see my finger (what?), you see my thumb (what?)
you see my fist, fuck a peace pipe, i'm (what?)
here for the smoke but it's not the weed i want (what?)
with this beat i brung for the beef i've come (woo)
but you better bring it if you wanna reply from
'cause for you to be lyrically inclined, it'd be a steep climb up
that'll be an uphill battle
but i'm up like your feet in a recliner
and i think i'm about to go out on a limb like a tree climber
time to push my ceiling higher 'cause


where am i supposed to go from here? (woah-oh-oh) hey
really i have no idea (all)
all i know is every time i think i hit my ceiling (yeah, oh)
i go higher than i've ever fuckin' been (for the last time, my only question is)
where am i supposed to go from here? (woah-oh-oh) hey
really i have no idea (all i know is, all)
all i know is every time i think i hit my ceiling (yeah, oh)
i go higher than i've ever fuckin' been (damn)

"this could never work," is what we said at first
but whatever this is, it's working
but we're in two different worlds and (yeah)
i'm not your husband (nah), you ain't my girlfriend
all i know is that (what?)
when i'm with you, i'm a different person, yeah
and i ain't never met a chick as perfect
girl, you're a ten, so here i am (yeah)
laying here with her again
thinking 'bout you
she's asleep, you're texting me around two
crying face emoji, you say, "this is me without you"
we're sneaking out to meet at cheap hotel rooms or
sex in the car, then i'll text you tomorrow
do i question it? nah, no objection at all
'cause both of us are still involved, so
as i'm peelin' off, all i'm thinking 'bout is


i'm not happy here (nah), with her
rather have you (yeah), rather have me too
'cause you're not happy there (you're not happy there), with him
rather have me (i know, but), we’re just in too deep


you're laying there with him, thinking 'bout me
he's asleep, you say, "let's meet around three"
you went to leave the house, he caught you sneaking out, now he's freaking out
you thought he was sleepin' soundly, woah
you say you're going for a drive, you don't question him
when he stumbles in, like, "where the fuck you've been?"
then you pump his ear with what he wants to hear
tell him you love him, yeah, wipe each other's tears
but it's been a couple years since we been doin' dirt
you or my girl, don't wanna see either of you get hurt
but now the lines are getting super blurred
can't tell if i'm cheating on her with you or cheating on you with her
but really, nobody's at fault, can't help who you love
hope they don't overhear us talk
'cause we both are getting sloppy
probably subconsciously part of me's hoping we get caught 'cause


i'm not happy here (nah), with her
rather have you (yeah), rather have me too
'cause you're not happy there (you're not happy there), with him
rather have me (i know, but), we’re just in too deep


we're laying here with them, thinking 'bout us
'cause now when we get home, we get jealous
of each other being someone else's
call us long john silver's 'cause we selfish
but i just wanna see ya
don't care if it's at the ritz or motel 6
if i'm there with ya, rich or poor
when i'm laying here with ya, it could be the kitchen floor
i could stay in bed with ya starin' at ya 'til the morn'
i just wanna be your secret lover, yeah
i'd rather share ya than to not have you at all
so once a year or twice a month i'm here if you want it
yeah, i'm open season
and i'm always game, so i keep it a hundred, dear, haha
'cause we could never be each other's everythings, you got a wedding ring
so it's him instead of me, but i'll be your second string, now and forever because


i'm not happy here (nah), with her
rather have you (yeah), rather have me too
'cause you're not happy there (you're not happy there), with him
rather have me (i know, but), we’re just in too deep (i'm in way too deep)

and i don't think that i can stop it (here it comes)
i do my best to try to block it (redrum)
i've been sipping on like, vodka (head's numb)
i'm blacking out, you better watch it (it's bedlam)


i thought i heard a voice in my head that said "kill"
i had no other choice that was left except fill
my pencil full of poisonous lead, the devil
he wants me to murder this beat, so i will
he told me there are doubters who question my skill
they wanna put my style to the test, am i still
the best? they want the crown on my head, i said, "chill
if you want me to murder this beat, then i will"


i thought i heard a voice in my head that said "kill"
i had no other choice that was left except fill
my pencil full of poisonous lead, the devil

they wanna put my style to the test, am i still
the best? they want the crown on my head, i said, "chill
if you want me to murder this beat, then i will"


now this will probably be the most illest shit that i've ever said
god bless the dead and let biggie possess the pencil lead
they called me a sped and said that i had a messed up head
'cause i said, "motherfuck school," and instead went to special ed
sippin' bacardi and lime i start to recollect on the time
that i startled my mom and had her scared to death
word to method man
she heard some wu-tang coming from towards the patio
she was like, "what the heck was that?"
she went to check on the noise and go inspect the deck
then i jumped out with a sword and yelled, "protect your neck"
now bow to the lord, hold up, no, better yet, kneel
better yet, get down on all fours and take a vow to always
rejoice in the sound of my voice, but you don't have a choice
just a third of my will will overpower yours
using about a fourth to create the amount of force
it'll take to knock out a horse like a tranq full of tylenol
enter my house of horrors with a thousand floors
got a crown of thorns, but it won't fit around the horns
but i'ma keep it a buck like a dollar store
i'm more than you bargained for and i am far more worse
than a forty-some bar lord jamar verse
nothing means more than respect, so when i curse
you could say i swore to protect
my image, i have zero time or regard for
a never-was, been claiming rap when it's not yours
if it was anyone's house, g rap and rakim would be havin' you mop floors
run-dmc would be havin' you cleanin' sinks
yeah, your group was off the chain, but you were the weakest link
rest of these youngins of mine
time to start throwing some shade, this time i'm shutting the blinds
'cause when i'm looking at y'all, shit, it's no wonder it's why
i need a visor, 'cause y'all are just sons in my eyes
born a cynic and more demented than an orphanage with a morgue up in it
next door to an abortion clinic
newborn infants tortured and tormented
with their foreheads dented when they drop 'cause the floor's cemented
their corpses get ornamented
the coroner with a storage bin rented
to store them in and the torsos of forty women reported missin'
distorted, twisted, this isn't no storybook ending
this is only the beginning
so, lord, forgive me, i'm hearing voices
i can't ignore them anymore, they're winning


i thought i heard a voice in my head that said "kill"

they wanna put my style to the test, am i still

like officemax
never down, i'll be up like an insomniac
girl, i got racks you got a rack
how you got all that back and no body fat
i'm in awe with that
when i stopped the pontiac at the laundromat that i saw you at
you almost had a heart attack, went into cardiac
you ran inside and told your boyfriend like, "i'll be back"
but for all you knew i probably act like i'm daniel wozniak
i'm a psycho-pa-pathic killer
i'm a cap peeler, caterpillar
with the botanic of bananas
you never heard better vernacular
comin' after your scapula
for the lack of a better word, dracula
'cause i'm attackin' a rapper at the phrenic nerves
i'm a savage, back to put the dagger in the back of competitors
predator and scavenger
i am a carnivore and a baller, you're at the dollar store
what the fuck you got a wallet for? y'all are poor
i was livin' in squalor but, uh-uh, not no more

yeah, i'm a (what?), i'm a (what?), i'm a (killer)
yeah

yeah (i knew this day was coming)
sometimes, you gotta come back down (it's all going to hell now, man)
stoop to someone's level (yeah)


five dozen flies buzzin' over your head
call me the grim reaper, sleep is my cousin
you're dead to me now and i'ma be the last face you see
'fore you die 'cause in (yep)
my eye are tigers and i'm a survivor so i will rise up and (what?)
be triumphant 'cause when i'm looking at my legacy (leg, i see)
bunch of dogs tryna dry hump it
like triumph the puppet, so i'm like, "fuck it"
pile the carnage up 'til it's so high, it's touching the sky
let 'em all line up and attack
single filing up in the stack
call 'em toy soldiers (yeah)
'cause they just wind up on their backs
now the sky's nothing but black
but i am not coming back, i done told ya
i told the woke me to go to sleep
but still, they keep on provoking me
they're hoping to see me completely broken emotionally
but how in the fuck am i not supposed to be woke
when these fuckers just keep poking me? now


i've been down, kicked
like around six thousand times since i was a kid
as a child, picked on, clowned, been
countless times i've been outed
gotta remind myself of it every now and then (yeah)
so the route i went's self-empowerment
in a hole, taught myself how to get out of it
and balance it with talents, wit
'cause life is like a penny (life is like a penny)
'cause it's only one percent
who overcome the shit they've underwent
i went awol like what my back was up against
don't tell me 'bout struggle, bitch, i lived it
i was five or six the first time i got my hind end kicked
malcolm, isaac, and boogie jumped me and took my tricycle
and i don't know if i would call that white privilege, yeah
but i get it, how it feels to be judged by pigment
besides getting it from both sides of the tracks
but i swore i'd get them back
even if it meant selling my soul to get my revenge and (what?)
thought of a scheme and it got me to thinking
if i can believe in myself, i could prolly achieve it
that's part of the reason i do all my talking with ink
and as long as i'm breathing, i vow to outsmart 'em and beat 'em
a god with a heart of a demon, go at 'em and i'ma get even
like i'm in the garden of eden, i'm 'bout to go off of the deep end
this evil is calling, i'm already seething and


okay, so while macklemore was keeping his room nice and neat (yeah)
i was getting my ass beat twice a week (what?)
looking for a place for the night where i could sleep (yeah)
flippin' sofa cushions over just tryin' to see
if i could find some change and scrape up for a bite to eat
if denaun and me find a couple dimes a piece
twenty five cents each'd get us a bag of chips
we'd be glad to get that even if we had to split
we'd do backward flips, looking back at it
i think that would fit with the definition of not having shit
couple that with the fact my mother was batshit
pop was a sack of shit, yeah, he died, but i gave half a shit
yeah, which brings me back to the dear ol' dad that i zero had
since a year-old, forty-seven year-old scab
just to hear them words, ear piercing
like my earlobe stabbed with a needle for an earring
should i feel upset? you were dead to me 'fore you died
me? tear no shed
should i have made a mural at your funeral?
had your coffin draped with a hero's flag?
where the fuck you were at
when de'angelo done hurt me real bad at the rio grande?
never met your grandkids, fucking coward
only guts you had was from your stomach fat
i couldn't see your ass goin' to heaven
so i'm asking for a pass to go to hell
so i can whip your fucking ass
i hate that i'll never get to say "i hate you" to your face
no coming back from where i'm going
sky is dark, my soul is black, hand on the shovel
dig with the blade of it then i step on the metal
vendetta to settle, tell the devil


i'm leaving heaven (yeah)
i'm leaving heaven (you know, i should dig your motherfucking ass up)
angels won't find me (just to spit in your fucking face)
where i am going (holding my baby pictures up like you're proud of me)
i'm leaving heaven (fuck you, bitch)
i'm leaving heaven (you know what? maybe if i'da had you)
angels won't find me (i wouldn't have went through half the shit i went through, so i blame you)
where i am going (or maybe i should say, "thank you")
('cause i wouldn't have been me, haha)


so you better, you better run (yeah)
you better, you better run (so i'ma let it go now, rest in peace)
you better, you better run (cocksucker, haha)
you better, you better run (see you in hell)

call this evil intent, like me in a limo (yeah)

my name is marsh and this world, i'm out of it (out of it)
'cause with all this a-b-c shit, i'm starting to sound like alf a bit
ha, i kill me, this medicine's counterfeit
i was mislead by the sound of it, how am i gonna get turnt up on this valium shit? (yeah)


checked in at the royal garden
to chill and avoid my problems
until paranoia caused me
to feel like i'm going bonkers
for real, think my toilet's talkin'
i spilled like, like forty bottles
of pills, think your boy is startin'
to feel like a spoiled carton of milk
'cause it just occurred
my girl's cheatin', i'm kickin' that fucking bitch to the curb
but the word "fucking" ain't meant to be a descriptive word
the type of bitch she is, ain't no adjective, it's a verb
ho thinks her snatch is magical
but that's how she attracts men, though
traps 'em and attack similar to an actual arachnid
or a vaginal tarantula or black widow
in fact, it'll be nothin' to throw that lil' bitch with a capital b out the back window
of the black cadillac limo like a whack demo
when i'm strapped, when i spit rapid, like a ratchet
a halfwit, i'll aim at, then i'll
been fire bitch, i can outrap reynolds
a pad and pen'll be great, but a napkin'll do
return of the whack sicko
head spinnin' like invisibl skratch piklz
yeah, shady's back, see the bat signal
it's time to go bat shit, like you accidentally ate a louisville slugger and crapped it
i'd like to introduce myself
hi there, bitch...


my name is marsh and, i'm out this world (this world)
s on my chest (superman) like it's plural (it's lit)
call me extra, extraterrestrial
extra, extra, extraterrestrial (skrrt, yeah)


i could keep beefin', fuck is the point?
i could make it really difficult for motherfuckers to come to detroit
if you're still looking for smoke, i already gave you an l
i'd rather just see you in hell, but i should get puff on the joint (diddy)
wait, run it back, i said give you an l, inhale
puff on the joint, i am the blunt you avoid
used to get jumped for my prowings
when i was growing up they said a slinky's a wonderful toy
my mother thought i was such a fun little boy
"oh, what a bundle of joy"
until the morning she suffered a punch in the groin
from a tantrum i was throwing
like a motherfuckin' disgruntled employee
i don't cut the beat 'til i fuckin' destroy it
once i get going, rain, thunder, it's storming
puddles are forming, i hear somebody's voice
in my head, say it's still a dream
then he said kill emcees
trippie redd, with pills and lean
sipping meds in the limousine
getting head, guillotine


my name’s marsh and, i'm out this world (this world)
s on my chest (superman) like it's plural (it's lit)
call me extra, extraterrestrial (yeah)
extra, extra, extraterrestrial


yeah
so all of y'all can just suck a penis (suck a penis)
i'll do the opposite (i'll do the opposite)
eat you pussies like cunnilingus (like cunnilingus)
there ain't no stoppin' it (there ain't no stoppin' it)
they say i'm such a genius (they say i'm such a genius)
when that kamikaze hit (when that kamikaze hit)
now they call me "butterfingers" (they call me "butterfingers")
'cause i just keep droppin' shit (i just keep droppin' shit)
you wanna butt heads? shut up, beavis, haha
i got your bitch with her butt out
i'm hittin' a lick 'cause she stickin' her tongue out (bitch)
you got no hitters, you might be pitchin' a shut out
she 'bout to give up the dugout (yeah)
i should just live in a nuthouse
right now, i live in an igloo (yeah)
and i'm not chillin' the fuck out
treat you like a stepparent, does to a stepchild with red hair and
plus i get dough like ed sheeran, so call me the ginger bread man
i'm a stan of redman, x-clan and i'm a treach fan
but i look up to myself (yeah)
like a fucking headstand (yeah)
so why, w-w-w-why else would i call myself an alien?
how could i hit a dry spell? (yeah), i'm named after the wetlands


i'm marsh and, i'm out this world (this world)
s on my chest (superman) like it's plural (it's lit)
call me extra, extraterrestrial (yeah)
my name is marsh and, my name is, my name is
my name is marsh

i could be with anybody, i choose you
still, it's no excuse to abuse you
but no one knows what i'm goin' through, so i'd use you
to be truthful, i wouldn't know what to do if i lose you
so i refuse to, might have a screw loose and a fuse blew
but i think i might be buildin' up a tolerance to you
'cause one minute i'm hollerin', "screw you"
next, i take it back, guess you can say i'm tryna unscrew you
but the shit's about to pop off, yeah, i feel you up
then i got you totally open as soon as i take your top off
you're so hard to resist, you knock my socks off
my friends say you're bad for me, hogwash


i'll never love again
the way i loved you
did you find someone new?
are you doin' this with them?
'cause i remember when
still remember when you was mine, yeah
we were inseparable at one time, yeah
you know my love for you was undying, yeah
used to always have my back


some days it feels like you're all that i have
that's why i'm tryna hold onto you for as long as i can
and you just want me for my money so i got you wrapped all in saran
damn, talk about eatin' out the palm of my hand
but if not for my financials
i wouldn't have you anyways, there have been ample
plenty days, where i'm just in a daze and i can't pull
myself up out this rut and you're so much of a handful
i can only take so much of you all at one time
because too much of you's just too much to swallow sometimes
gotta take you in doses, but when you're not at my side
i shake in convulsions, separation anxiety 'cause we may be the closest
yeah, baby, we hopeless, don't we make an atrocious
combination? we know, it's like playin' with explosives
quite dangerous though, but my brain's in hypnosis
such a wide range of emotions
migraines, but why the fuck am i takin' these motrins?
ibuprofens, like a drop of rain in the ocean
and you're my fix on the days when i'm broken
but the shit's about to go sideways, i just know it


i'll never love again
the way i loved you
did you find someone new?
are you doin' this with them?
'cause i remember when
still remember when you was mine, yeah
we were inseparable at one time, yeah
you know my love for you was undying, yeah
used to always have my back


so i spiral downwardly 'cause i'm too cowardly to leave you
head is clouded in a fallacy, but in reality
somehow it seems like when i lay me down to sleep i'm counting sheep
you're bound to creep
'cause every time i turn around, you keep runnin' out on me
you're my xanax and my valium, i'm an addict, you're a downer
you're my habit, it's like i found you in the cabinet
but it's like i can't uncap it 'cause it's childproof
a scoundrel and fiend's how i feel around you
awful, every time i lost you, felt like i had you in my pocket
now i'm flippin' over the furniture, punchin' holes in the walls through
everything that we've gone through
how many times you've fucked me
but the way it felt for me to be on top when i was on you
swore my fealty, but word to g.o.d
i thought you loved me, bitch, you tried to kill me, i'm getting off you
quit callin' for me, hard proof's how i respond to
the ambien and tylenols too
fuck all you


fuckin' bitch
we're done

(oh, oh, yeah) yeah
you know, if i had a chance to do it all over again (oh, oh)
i wouldn't change shit (oh, oh)
d.a. got that dope
i'm screamin' out no regrets


yeah, they miss the old me
i think they want me to od on codeine
they want my life in turmoil like in '03
they want front row seats, i give 'em nosebleeds
they want me imploding, exploding, self-loathing, eroding
i'm screaming at 'em with no regrets and i'm hulking
i'm rippin' out of my clothing
i had to go see the doc like kool moe dee (yeah)
never took much to convince dre
never been swayed by color or skin shades
since day one, hellraiser with twin blades of a sensei
givin' up, no comprende (woo)
tin brain, prolly fucked in the membrane
slim sha— mind's in the gutter, but insane
pen game like i just struck in the tenth frame (screamin' out no regrets)
yeah, i live on the edge, i sit on the ledge
to shit on your heads, i been on the bench
forgive and forget is the only thing i'd ever live to regret
hell-bent on revenge, you left me for dead
i crawled out my grave, you better be ready and set
my enemies ain't put an end to me yet (i'm screamin' out no regrets)


you been through the hardest spot, ego the largest, i made you a star (i'm screamin' out no regrets)
i been movin' slowly, tryna play it low, the 'vette look like a storm (screamin' out no regrets, yeah, no apologies, i ain't takin' shit back)
put you through dumb shit, got you thinkin' i run shit (i ain't havin' regrets)
i've been feeling so alone, just like i'm so (yeah) lost


all the hate, can't tell exactly where it stems from
but it's happening again, huh?
y'all used to be in my corner
now you just backed me in one
innocent bystanders, i'm bound to hit some
for some adversaries, i carry big guns
so some targets'll get the kill shot
some, i just barely nicked 'em
i can make a mistake and erupt and end up takin' a dump
for sayin' some dumb shit, thinkin' i run shit
misplacin' my anger enough to give earl and tyler, the creator the brunt (yeah)
shoulda never made a response, shoulda just aimed for the fake ones
them traitorous punks, 'cause snakes are just cunts
they can get fucked with eight hundred motherfuckin' vibrators at once (yeah)
and for any of those who may have come close to about dyin'
and can't listen to "arose" without cryin'
for those who feel low like you're 'bout spiralin'
but this is only for those that i'm inspirin'
weapon never unholstered without firin'
my will i'm imposin', foes are gonna feel like they're in the throes of a mountain lion
they talk about my daughters hopin' i fly off of the handle (handle)
'cause my first thought is to trample and write a thousand bars
but sometimes it's like dropping' an anvil on a house of cards
or godzilla squashin' a crouton with combat boots on
or droppin' a goddamn nuke bomb on top of an anthill
(i'm screamin' out no regrets) can't do it, nah


you been through the hardest spot, ego the largest, i made you a star (i'm screamin' out no regrets, took it all)
i been movin' slowly, tryna play it low, the 'vette look like a storm (screamin' out no regrets, yeah, no regrets though, no white flags either)
put you through dumb shit, got you thinkin' i run shit (i ain't havin' regrets, yeah)
i've been feeling so alone, just like i'm so lost, just like i'm—

she loves me, she loves my knot
not for who i am, but what i got, yeah
and i don't wanna blow up her spot
but da-na-na, na-na, da-naa (woo)


lady, i been watchin' you from the back every time that you walk past
hate to put you on blast but you got a bomb ass (yeah)
been checkin' you out ever since the second you
stepped in through naunie's dressing room, girl, you're stunning, i'd bet that you'd
zap me if i was next to you, sparks'll fly, i expect 'em to
i'd be shocked if they didn't, 'cause you're carmen electra-cute (cutie)
and those ain't just sound effects
i knew something was special soon as we swapped info, i knew that


she loves me, she loves me not
for who i am, but what i got
but she loves me, she loves me not (aha)
she loves me (one more time)
i said, 'cause she loves me (she loves me), she loves me not
for who i am (she loves me), but what i got
but she loves me, she loves me not
she loves me


sorry i missed your call again, i be in the studio usually
but tomorrow afternoon for me'd work beautifully
if your schedule's open, you say, "that's cool with me
but you stood me up twice, slim, you're 0-for-2 with me"
'cause like a basket, you've been going through hoops for me
well, if the ball's in my court, why don't we shoot for three?
yeah, i'll pick you up and we'll cruise through the d
and as soon as we hung up, i'm like, "woo"


'cause she loves me (she loves me), she loves me not
for who i am (she loves me), but what i got
but she loves me, she loves me not (aha)
she loves me (ayo, lemme do this bridge right quick)


she pulls me close and whispers to me, oh-oh
lies in my ear, but that's all i wanna hear
that's okay, long as we both know this is all it is, woah
she can have my love for as long as we both are here


we're back in my spot now (yeah), the music is loud, so (what?)
i turn the boombox down (shh), we cut off our cell phones
you're killin' me soft now, wanna hit it like balboa
'cause girl, you're a knockout, your body is out cold (out cold)
(woo) i put the moves on you like a u-haul
bend you over the foosball table, your shoes fall
to the floor, but canoodlin', i'm not in the mood for
gotta get me out of these drawers if you wanna (want a) spoon, doll (yeah)
but before we get to droppin' these drawers, there's options to explore
we can fuck in the closet (yeah) or on my elevator (uh)
and maybe when it stops and the door opens
we fall out and we just get off on this floor (haha)
you say you're falling for me, but not 'cause i'm famous
then explain to me who that tattoo that's on your leg's of
girl, your game is an a-plus, but you think i don't notice
who the screensaver on your damn phone is
it ain't 'cause who i am, bullshit, i like you
just don't take me for no stupid ass, no disrespect
'cause even though you're like my truest fan, know it's
clear you only love me 'cause i'm superman, lois, but fuck it


'cause she loves me (she loves me), she loves me not
for who i am (she loves me), but what i got
but she loves me, she loves me not
she loves me (yeah, one more time)
i said, 'cause she loves me (she loves me), she loves me not
for who i am (she loves me), but what i got

my, my stepdad


one thing that sticks in my craw
when i was six and i saw my stepfather hittin' my ma
socked her right in her eyeball
i'm startin' to think i'm psychotic
with all the pictures i draw of
shit that i've already witnessed, it’s probably twisted my thoughts
all i can hear is drama with mom and him
i can always hear 'em arguin' down the hallways
the walls are thin so the noise is startin' to feel like the norm
our dog pissed on the carpet, he stomped it so hard
doctors had to put it down
he killed my chihuahua, this motherfucker!


i, i, hate
my, my stepdad (stepdad)
so tonight i'm sayin', "bye-bye stepdad" (stepdad)


outside, i look like i'm calm
inside, i'm a tickin' time bomb
'cause of this motherfucker, who sticks his dick in my mom (my mom)
last night, he said i left the kitchen light on
but he walked in there this morning and purposely flipped it, i saw him
hickory switch to my bottom, i counted sixty-nine times
he swatted me with it, i'd cry
he just started hittin' me harder
god, i wish i could just jaw him
if i could get my weight up
but i'm just a second grader
this prick is bigger than i am
but i've been readin' at school about this shit called liquid cyanide
i'm fantasizin' at night when he's sleepin' at just the right time
sneak up with a lethal injection
and put him down like they did to my dog
i'm talkin' euthanasia (euthanasia), like kids in taiwan
this fuckin' shit's like saigon (saigon)
neighbors called police on him
so many battery charges, this dude's like lithium-ion
then mom and him let bygones (bygones)
just be bygones
so on eggshells, i walk and just try not to piss this guy off
but this is why i...


i, i, hate
my, my stepdad (stepdad)
so tonight i'm sayin', "bye-bye stepdad" (stepdad)


so this year, i'm goin' into the fifth and i'm tall
i'm five foot six on my block, i'm the toughest kid but i got
way bigger fish to fry
which is why i'm tryin' to get this bitch to fly off
the handle and wait for the fist to fly to put this guy in a pine box
he's always lookin' for chaos but tonight i've cooked up a plan
so this christmas, i got some color books and some crayons
i'm layin' on the floor, in the living room with some friends colorin'
he walks by, kicks my arm and goes, "oops" and just laughs
i yelled for mom (mom) and as she's rushin' to my defense
i stood up and said, "fuck you, punk" and i took off and ran
to my bedroom, as i fled
knowin' shit would hit the fan
slammed the door and hid behind it with an aluminum bat
he kicked it in
i swung it hard as i could at his head
his noodle went splat, he fell right at the foot of my bed
i'm a little bit scared but my anger's overtooken the fear
i threw down the bat and just started whoopin' his ass
beat him with my bare hands, the big bad wolf ain't so bad
"ding-dong," the pussy is dead, the bully finally gets his
stomped him until he pissed enough to fill a two-liter with
then buried him next to my dog
and if i go to juvie for this, i'ma tell 'em


i, i, hate
my, my stepdad (stepdad)
so tonight i'm sayin', "bye-bye stepdad" (stepdad)
'cause i, i, hate
my, my stepdad (stepdad)
so tonight i'm sayin', "bye-bye stepdad" (stepdad)

yeah, you know what? (loud pack)
haters are funny, man (haha)

like a sasquatch in a crawlspace
'cause you're watchin' your heart race like you're scarface
in a car chase with the cops or an arcade
stuck inside of a mario kart race duckin' saw blades

colored van pull up with a handful of xans

it's okay not to like my shit
everything's fine, drink your wine, bitch

does bill cosby sedate once he treats to cheesecake and a decent steak? (huh?)

i am the complete opposite of these retards who spit these weak bars, i'ma leave carnage
each thought'll be so toxic, it'll block the wind through your esophagus

and i hit them pads like a boxing gym
better watch for slim, better get to popping and when i'm at the top again
i won't topple, i'm giving it to anyone who wanna come and get it and i'm not gonna stop
but when they ask me is the war finished with mgk? of course it is
i cleansed him of his mortal sins, i'm god and the lord forgives even the devil worshippers
i'm moving on but you know your scruples are gone when you're born with lucifer's horns
and you're from the school of notorious, puba, cube and the poor righteous teachers tutored my students
showed them all the blueprint and formula
but it seems like the more they studied my music, the more they remind me of eyeballs
i'm watching my pupils get cornier (uh)
but i'm contemplating yelling "bombs away" on the game
like i'm outside of an ariana grande concert waiting


they call me saddam hussein, ayatollah khomeini
where's osama been? i been laden lately
look at how i'm behaving, they want me gone away

shady like a shadow or your silhouette, intellect, i better check to see why you feel upset
'cause i met your bitch on the internet now i'm getting head like a pillow pet
that bimbo can put her lips all the way around this bone and then blow
like a dusty cartridge from an old nintendo
those were the days but i bet you, i'm never gonna be broke again, no
i don't smoke but i got paper, to be blunt, i'm rolling indo
and i keep it one comma, zero, zero, zero, zero
real, real, real, murder, murder, murder, kill, kill, kill
nickel-plated, twenty two, two, two
bitch, shut the fuck up 'fore i shoot you too
ain't shit i won't do just to get a few youtube views
run up in a church like pew, pew, pew
'cause that's what i do, do, do
but, even to the untrained human eye
we ain't the same, you and i
somebody should have explained to you why
for you to go against me, it's simply insane, you will die (yeah)
that's why they call me kamikaze, it's plain suicide, yeah
but i know magic and here go my last trick
i'm 'bout to say "abracadabra" and pull a b rabbit up out of my hat
i'm about to relapse and i betcha that you won't know how to react
but a look of disgust, i don't doubt it'd be that
as i begin to fuckin' devour the track
and you backpedal, that is a cowardly act
like a saudi attack when the towers collapsed


they call me saddam hussein, ayatollah khomeini
where's osama been? i been laden lately
look at how i'm behaving, they want me gone away
they wanna jonbenét me (fuck you), i'm unaccommodating

i love conflict, got a obnoxious (what?) subconscious (yeah)
i'm afraid to unlock it (nah)

i'm what an idiotic ('otic) savant is (savant is)
but i've been throwin' down gauntlets since that underground rawkus (yeah)
where i planted my roots (what? yeah)
that's how i had a whole planet that roots for me
as in the group, and no one thinks dark as i think (nah)
so imagine the havoc these black thoughts are to wreak (tariq)
as in trotter, i keep slaughterin' beats
shout out to beatminerz and t-minus
but, me, long as i breathe, promise to be honest
and wholeheartedly, apologies, rihanna
for that song that leaked, i'm sorry, ri
it wasn't meant to cause you grief
regardless, it was wrong of me, but


i be on my own (yeah), head up in the clouds like zeus

i've seen the hugest (hugest) debuts ('buts)
i've had a great view to see the (see the) game through (through)
and drake, they're gonna turn on you (you) one day too (too)
and the more you win, the sooner (sooner) they do
they'll be calling you a trash bin
sayin' that your new one isn't better than your last and
even if it is, once they start to turn their backs
they ain't never comin' back in
they did it to chance
next they'll be mentionin' future in the past tense (yeah)
or sayin' "adiós" to migos

i got eleven years of sobriety (yeah)
so the only bottom i'ma be hittin' is if it's sodomy
wait, i mean, you would think that somebody handed a saw to me (sodomy)
how i'm choppin' these bars
they keep wantin' me to rap responsibly
when i'm constantly passin' the buck like the fuckin' dollar tree
but i'ma always remind you that i came from poverty
black people saved my life, from the doc and deshaun
and all that we want is racial equality
r.i.p. laquan mcdonald, trayvon, and breonna
atatiana, rayshard, and dominique
eric garner and rodney king
no, we can't get along 'til these white motherfuckin' cops
who keep murderin' blacks are off the streets (off the streets)
and, as far as squashin' beef, i'm used to people knockin' me
but, just not in my camp
