ice cube, is not for the pop charts
so where should a brother like you start expressin' yourself
my boy'll show you how
yo dre  - what up? - drop english right about...
....now, gettin' back to the pg
that's program, and it's easy
dre is back - new jacks are made hollow
expressin' ain't their subject because they like to follow the words
the style, the trend, the records i spin
again and again and again
yo ya on the other end
watch a brother playin' dope rhymes, with no help
there's no fessin' and guessin' while i'm expressin myself
it's crazy to see people be what society wants 'em to be
but not me
ruthless, is the way to go, they know
others say rhymes that fail to be original
or they kill where the hip-hop starts
forget about the ghetto, and rap for the pop charts
and those musicians, curse at home
but scared to use profanity, when up on the microphone
yeah they want reality, but you won't hear none
they rather exaggerate a little fiction
some say no to drugs, and take a stand
but after the show they go lookin for the dope man
oh they ban my group from the radio
hear n.w.a. and say ''hell no!''
but you know it ain't all about wealth
as long as you make a note to
(express yourself)
