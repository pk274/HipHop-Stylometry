all you gotta pay is attention, listen
keep the information flippin', that's the mission
make sure it trickle down to the children
make sure they know how to make a killin'
yeah, nigga, you said it take a village
teach they ass they ain't gotta go pillage
free game, no charge, go large
never let a nigga pull your ho card
bogart the boulevard
fuck the police, pay attention to the ogs
i'ma tell you like a nigga told me
you gotta hustle like e-40
get a duffel like snoop d-o-double-g
too $hort lay a bitch like gold leaf
i'ma show you how like i'm the chief
so you mama ain't gotta go lay a wreath
