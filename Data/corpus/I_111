once upon a time in the projects, yo
i damn near had to wreck a ho
i knocked on the door, "who is it?"
it's ice cube, come to pay a little visit to ya
and what's up with the niggas in the parking lot
she said "fuck em, cause they get sparked a lot"
i sat on the couch but it wasn't stable
and then i put my nikes on the coffee table
her brother came in, he's into gang-bangin'
cause he walked up and said "what set you claimin'?"
i don't bang, i write the good rhymes
the whole scenery reminded me of good times
i don't like to feel that i'm put in a rut
by a young nigga that needs to pull his pants up
he threw up a set and then he was gone
i'm thinkin' to myself: "won't this bitch bring her ass on?"
her mother came in with a joint in her mouth
and fired up the sess, it was sess no doubt
she said, "please excuse my house," and all that
i said, "yeah", 'cause i was buzzed from the contact
lookin' at a fucked up black and white
her mom's bitchin' cause the county check wasn't right
she had another brother that was three years old
and had a bad case of the runny nose
he asked me who i was then i had to pause
it smelled like he took a shit in his little drawers
i saw her sister who really needs her ass kicked
only thirteen and already pregnant
i grabbed my forty out the bag and took a swig
cause i was getting overwhelmed by bebe kids
they was runnin' and yellin' and playin' and cussin' and tellin'
and look at this young punk bailin'
i heard a knock on the door without the password
and her mom's got the twelve gauge mossberg
the nigga said "yo, what's for sale?" (yo, what's for sale, man?)
and the bitch came out with a bag of yayo
she made the drop and got the twenty dollars
from a smoked-out fool with ring around the collar
the girl i was waiting for came out
i said, "bitch, i didn't know this was a crack house"
i got my coat, and suddenly


the cop busted in and had a mac-10 pointed at my dome
and i said to myself, "once again, it's on"
he threw me on the carpet and wasn't cuttin' no slack
jumped on my head and put his knee in my back
first he tried to slap me up, wrap me up, rough me up
they couldn't do it so they cuffed me up
i said, "fuck, how much abuse can a nigga take"
hey yo officer you're making a big mistake
since i had on a shirt that said i was dope
he thought i was selling base and couldn't hear my case
he said, "get out my face" and musta had a grudge
his reply, "tell that bullshit to the judge"
the girl i was with wasn't sayin nothin'
i said "aiyyo bitch you better tell em somethin'"
she started draggin' and all of a sudden
we all got tossed in the paddy wagon
now i beat the rap but that ain't the point
i had a warrant so i spent two weeks in the joint
now the story you heard has one little object
don't fuck with a bitch from the projects


yo man the projects man ain't no joke
tell 'em
especially the motherfuckin' ones in watts and south central la boy
you don't fuck around with them projects, boy
rats'll whoop yo ass
yo, yo you see that ho over there man
look at that ho over there man
