right about now, n.w.a court is in full effect
judge dre presiding
in the case of n.w.a versus the police department
prosecuting attorneys are mc ren, ice cube
and eazy-motherfucking-e
order, order, order!
ice cube, take the motherfucking stand
do you swear to tell the truth, the whole truth
and nothing but the truth so help your black ass?
you goddamn right
well, won't you tell everybody what the fuck you gotta say?


fuck the police comin' straight from the underground
a young nigga got it bad 'cause i'm brown
and not the other color, so police think
they have the authority to kill a minority
fuck that shit, 'cause i ain't the one
for a punk motherfucker with a badge and a gun
to be beating on and thrown in jail
we can go toe-to-toe in the middle of a cell
fuckin' with me 'cause i'm a teenager
with a little bit of gold and a pager
searchin' my car, lookin' for the product
thinkin' every nigga is sellin' narcotics
you'd rather see me in the pen
than me and lorenzo rollin' in a benz-o
beat a police out of shape
and when i'm finished, bring the yellow tape
to tape off the scene of the slaughter
still getting swole off bread and water
i don't know if they fags or what
search a nigga down and grabbing his nuts
and on the other hand, without a gun, they can't get none
but don't let it be a black and a white one
'cause they'll slam ya down to the street top
black police showing out for the white cop
ice cube will swarm
on any motherfucker in a blue uniform
just 'cause i'm from the cpt
punk police are afraid of me, huh
a young nigga on the warpath
and when i'm finished, it's gonna be a bloodbath
of cops dying in l.a.Â 
yo, dre, i got something to say
