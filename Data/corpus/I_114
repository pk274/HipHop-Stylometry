here's a little somethin' 'bout a brotha like me
never shoulda been let out the penitentiary
ice cube would like to say
that i'm a crazy motha from around the way
since i was a youth, i smoked weed out
now i'm the type of punk that you read about
doin' a crime or two, that's what the hell i do
you don't like how i'm livin', well, kcuf uoy
this is a crew, and i'm in it
my man dre'll knock you out in a minute
with a right, left, right-left, you're toothless
and then you say, "damn, they ruthless"
we'll make you say it again (damn)
n.w.a's messing up the program
and then you realize we don't care
we don't just say no, we're too busy sayin', "yeah"
about drinking straight out the eight bottle
tell the truth, do i look like a role model?
to a kid looking up to me
life ain't nothin' but girls and money
'cause i'm the type of brotha that's built to last
we had some in the present, some in the past
but i don't give a damn 'cause i keep bailing
yo, tell 'em what they yelling


homies all standing around, just hangin'
some dope-dealin', some gang-bangin'
we decide to roll and we deep
see a sucka on daytons and we creep
real slow, and before you know
i had my ak pointed in the window
check it in, punk, or i might blast
he got scared and hit the gas
we tried to catch him, but you all know
you can't catch a 5.0, so
we headed right back to the fort
sweatin' all the girls in the biker shorts
we didn't get no play from the ladies
with six thugs in a car, are you crazy?
she was scared and it was showing
we all said, "kcuf uoy, hctib" and kept going
to the hood, and we was fittin' to
look for somethinâ€™ else to get into
like a new female, or in fact
a bum rush, but we call it rat pack
on a sucka for nothin' at all
ice cube'll go stupid when i'm full of eight ball
i might stumble, but still won't lose
now i'm dressed in the county blues
'cause i'm the type of brotha that's built to last
we had some in the present, some in the past
but i don't give a damn 'cause i keep bailin'
yo, tell 'em what they yellin'


here's a little gangsta, short in size
a t-shirt and levi's is his only disguise
built like a tank, yet hard to hit
ice cube and eazy-e cold rockin' it
