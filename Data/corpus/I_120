i got that bomb, bomb, diddy, diddy, diddy, bomb, bomb
when i hit you
push the issue
my ghetto dope is amazin
the bitch that's with you already know that i'm blazin
slide the number, we can slumber, on the under
girl no wonder, you got a ass full of thunder
the frozen tundra ain't cold enough
and baby ain't old enough

hit the shit we on
the rolleo's and the baguettes
you still fuckin with them faggots
we turn haters into maggots
oak on the dash, but no coke on the hash
you broke ass niggas learn to mash, like me
constantly, put the hustle down
with four or five niggas that's musclebound
send your head to the taxidermist
won't be satisfied, till i get my face on a thermos
you got to earn this, you can't take it
can't fake it, got to live it, or we gots to visit
who is it, the exquisite, don mega
