you best to free your mind
before i free my nine
and stop fucking with d'voidofpop
or feel my hot rocks
bang,bang, boom boom, ping ping i'm the black
white boys got a magazine and don't kow how to act
i'll attack and make you vomit
down with khalid abdul muhammad
do he got a brother, i'm it now
i'm the illest
wanna kill this house nigga don cornelius
can you feel this?
you punk niggas make me sick
sucking on the devil's dick
scared of revolution
need to start douching
houston is the place
i caught a case
them motherfuckers tried to put a scar on my face
but i bust two times to the gut
do the reverend calvin butts
got a pair of nuts?
i started this gangsta shit in '86
now you dissing me
for publicity
isn't he a ho to the third degree
who me
i'm a g who like to scrap-a-lot
down with rap-a-lot
and i can't stop, won't stop
so fuck bill and hillary
ice cube there ain't no killing me
ice cube, scarface
dropping on these selling out niggas, doing it like this
