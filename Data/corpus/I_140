if you cancel ice cube, you cancel yourself
you need the pied piper to get you through these vipers
these punk motherfuckers wanna send you to rikers
cut the check, who give a fuck if they like us?
cash that bitch for all the bangers and bikers
"hey, grandmama, i'm spinnin' the tires"
she said "where'd you get it?", "i got it from liars
you know, the one you said will be thrown in the fires"
see, granny used to sing "we shall overcome"
sixty years later, we barely got a crumb
sixty years later, we still in them streets
we didn't overcome, we victim of elites
nigga, grab that microphone, nigga, crab them cleats (woah, why, why, why?)
nigga, catch that pass, nigga, rock them beats
to every man, woman, boy or girl
that find theyself in love with this white man's world
