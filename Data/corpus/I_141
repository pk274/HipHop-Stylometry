hello


the motherfuckin' world is a ghetto
full of magazines, full clips, and heavy metal
when the smoke settle
i'm just lookin' for a big yellow
in six inch stilettos
dr. dre, hello, perculatin', keep 'em waitin'
while you sittin' here hatin', yo' bitch is hyperventilatin'
hopin' that we penetratin', you gets naythin'
'cause i never been to satan for hardcore administratin'
gangbang affiliatin', mc ren'll have you
wildin' off a zone and a whole half a gallon
(get to dialing) 9-1-1 emergency
(and you can tell 'em) it's my son, he's hurtin' me
(and he's a felon) on parole for robbery
ain't no coppin' a plea, ain't no stoppin' a g
i'm in the 6, you got to hop in the 3, company monopoly
you handle shit sloppily, i drop a ki properly
they call me the don dada
pop a collar, drop a dollar, if you hear me you can holla
even rottweilers follow the impala
wanna talk about this concrete? nigga, i'm a scholar
the incredible, heterosexual, credible
beg a ho, let it go, dick ain't edible
nigga ain't federal, i plan shit
while you, hand picked motherfuckers, givin' up transcripts
