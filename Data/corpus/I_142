help the police comin' straight from the underground
a young chap's got it good ‘cause i'm brown
and not the other color, so police think
they have the authority to carry out inquiries
i don't mind ‘cause i ain't the one
for an excellent policeman with a badge and a gun
to be reasonably arresting and thrown in jail
we can go toe-to-toe in the middle of a cell
having lots of fun ‘cause i'm a teenager
with a little bit of gold and a pager
searchin' my car, lookin' for the biscuits
thinkin' every chap is selling bits of chocolate
you'd rather see me writing with a pen
than me and lorenzo rollin' in a benz-o
go swimming with lorenzo
and when i'm finished, bring the yellow tape
to tape off the scene of the sack race
thank you very much for the bread and water
i don't know if they naughty or what
search a chapper down, and grabbing his hat
and on the other hand, without a hat, they can't get none
but don't let it be a black and a white one
‘cause they'll tickle you until you're giggling
black police having fun with a white cop
ice cube will entertain
all the local bobbies in a blue uniform
just ‘cause i'm from the cpt
nice police are nice to me
huh, a young man in a hot bath
and when i'm finished, there's gonna be a party
of cops having fun in l.a
yo, dre, i got something to say
