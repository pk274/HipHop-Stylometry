funky, funky bootzilla
watch the boy play the bass like godzilla
watch me pimp the mic like a gorilla
in a snoop deville when i go get her
now i'm dressed to kill when you see me with her
how i make you feel, just a little bitter
you can take a pill to try to feel better
or you can ask bootsy to help you get her


ah yeah, play on, playa
cincinnati, ohio
ah yeah
yay-yay
we got to do it (do it 'til we get it)
los angeles, california
ah, we ain't on the porch here, mama
