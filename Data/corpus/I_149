man, i ain't gon' be shit in the morning
after drinking that, uh


if i can sell you the american dream, i can sell you anything


i got to get out, i'm getting put out of my house
i got to pack up my refrigerator and couch
it's a set-up, but the bank wants me out
or the l.a.p.d. will smoke me out
this adjustable rate, it choked me out
they gave me a loan, and i had no clout
they gave me a house, for me and my spouse
called my momma and my aunt
y'all should re-finance
i let 'em dance with the devil
dig their own grave and i gave them the shovel
fuck, my daddy built that house
and when he got drunk, he almost killed that house
is this the american dream, or the american scheme?
that got me walking in these american streets?
it's kinda sad when you have to get a hernia
cuz you help your grand mama move her furniture


if i can sell you the american dream, i can sell you anything


look at this maggot, with a stimulus package
i can give a fuck about a dow jones average
what the fuck you do when your paycheck is average?
law abiding citizen turn into a savage
got to feed children, got to feed the habit
fell into a rabbit hole, chasing that rabbit
now i'm in wonderland feeling like the son of sam
i'm at your west coast branch, gun in hand
i'mma feel like superman
walk by the teller, better call the trooper, mam
it's the revenge of the lambs
big bad wolf, we're sick of these scams
sick of these plans, sick of this dance
walked into his office took the nine out my pants
you're not a man, you're a serpent
then i prayed to god let the nine get to workin'


i better get to workin'
you know i heard they hood robbin'
your money or your life and there ain't no stopping
i better get to workin'
you know i heard they hood robbin'
your money or your life and there ain't no stopping


ain't that a bitch
when you got to steal from the poor, and give to the rich
ain't that a bitch
when you got to steal from the poor, and give to the rich


uh, drug dealer md
doctor feel good, give you what you need
in california, prescribe that weed
oxy cotton and codeine
turn your grand mama into a fiend
and see the sign not at first, it ain't free
i know you 'bout to die, but let me see your id
i know you 'bout to lie, but can you pay this fee?
if you can't pay, then please have a seat
you can't see a doctor, but you could see a priest
we canâ€™t save your life 'til we got some assurance
your premium is paid at that insurance
i hope you got endurance
they got me on hold, and i'm under the influence
nurse high as a kite
in charge with my life
and everything is lost
without a blue cross


you know i heard they hood robbin'
your money or your life and there ain't no stopping
you know i heard they hood robbin'
your money or your life and there ain't no stopping


ain't that a bitch (that's a bitch)
when you got to steal from the poor, and give to the rich
ain't that a bitch (that's a bitch)
when you got to steal from the poor, and give to the rich


whatever you need
we got it for cheap right here, baby
this america, it ain't gonna cost you nothing
but a arm and a leg
maybe one of them motherfuckin' ears
don't trip, just put it on your credit card
put it in your baby name
