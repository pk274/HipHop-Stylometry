i was lookin' for a job when i found this bitch
today is the perfect day to quit
go in the boss bathroom and take a shit
the receptionist, that bitch a witch
i need this lil' money, i must admit
but your dignity is all you get
i treat it like a job, real ho' hum
you just don't know you're fuckin' with the wrong one
yeah, punk, you's a liar
send my supervisor straight to kaiza
pressin' charges, i'm the largest
y'all better hope that you ain't my target
make a track meet out a supermarket
don't think i ain't down to spark it
thug life, tupac shakur
fuck it, i'ma go and be an Ðµntrepreneur, bitch
