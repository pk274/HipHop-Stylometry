niggas never thought they'd see cube and biggie
in the year 2000 all drunk and pissy
off whiskey, you can miss me acting gay
he's the king of new york, i'm the king of l.a
doin it the o.g. way, it's sorta like
the brooklyn way, it's just the crook in me
so this is dedicated to the memory of
the notorious one, the glorious one
and if you go for your gun, i got to go for mine
cock my nine and seperate your head from your spine
so, "grab yo' dicks if you love hip-hop" and
fuck you niggas that shot big pop'
the conspiracy of this nation for assassination
of the young black male in this black hell
and i can tell, no matter the weather
that you and 2pac got your shit together
california love
