when you see me on ya block, call the police
let them motherfuckers know here come the beast
oh, in the late night hour


straight out of compton, a crazy motherfucker named ice cube
and i'm rollin' with the motherfuckin' neptunes
when i'm caught off, i got a sawed-off
a midget bitch that'll suck a niggas balls off
you too girl if ya fuck with me
i'm gettin' head, gutter lane, doin' sixty
about to crash like teddy pendergrass
mama said a hard head make a tender ass
to all the dogs that bark a lot
who don't give a fuck if it's dark or not
we'll be pimpin' in the parking lot
motherfuckers don't know if i can park or not
'cause i circle like vultures, la costa nostra
bumpin' all the baddest bitches like i'm 'posed ta
what's yo' name, what's yo' number and yo' culture?
you need nuts in yo' face like a poster


fuck the police comin' straight from the underground
fuckin' pig wanna act like he like me now
in '86, same bitch tried to lock me down
and motherfuckers wanna ask why i'm cocky now
to all the bitches that think they bootylicious
i think they nutritious, i think they do dishes
i'm makin' three wishes, or takin' they pictures
and spendin' they riches, and fuckin' they bitches
egomaniac, lil' homies call me brainiac
ice cube's an asshole and it ain't an act
so take a hit of that, and remember that
where my motherfuckin' niggas and my bitches at?
in the late night hour hit the front to back
check the motherfuckin' rims on the cadillac
on the ass attack, can you keep it tight?
and if the head right, nigga there every night


this is for my niggas that's schemin' for cash
and lookin' for ass (in the late night hour)
this is for my people that's countin' they riches
and pickin' up bitches (in the late night hour)
this is for my niggas that's countin' they cash
and lookin' for ass (in the late night hour)
this is for my people that's schemin' for riches
and pickin' up bitches (in the late night hour)


so check it, and everybody get naked
this might be a nigga last record
but respect it, 'cause i could do it all night, playa
i'm all fight, playa; you all spite, playa
it's all right, playa; a nigga might care
but to catch me you gotta do a light year
ice cube insane in the membrane
baby, go ahead; nigga please do the damn thang
we gonna get you high, nigga
our rhymes will get you by, nigga
tell me if i qualify, nigga
to bail in like superfly
i wanna get that, cop that, buy that, drop that
you want it too but don't know where to start at
fuckin' with me, nigga better bring his hard hat
nigga where ya heart at? leave you on the tarmac
with my top back, and my nigga mack
ridin' shotgun, with the top gun
don't catch a hot one soon as he spot one
westside connection is the doctrine
this ain't another club song
or love song that y'all can fuck on
so get the fuck on
a nigga rich, can't believe the bullshit that i'm stuck on
