goddamn, it's a brand new payback
from the straight gangsta mack in straight gangsta black
how many motherfuckers gotta pay?
went to the shelf and dusted off the ak
caps gotta get peeled
cause "the nigga ya love to hate" still can "kill at will"
it ain't no pop cause that sucks
and you can new jack swing on my nuts
down wit' the niggas that i bail out
i'm platinum, bitch, and i didn't have to sell out
"fuck you, ice cube", that's what the people say
fuck america, still with the triple k
'cause you know when my nine goes buck
it'll bust your head like a watermelon dropped from twelve stories up
now let's see who'll drop
punk motherfuckers tryin' to ban hip-hop
fuck r&b and the runnin' man
i'm the one that stand, with the gun in hand
make sure before you buck wit' duck quick
punk, 'cause i'm the wrong nigga to fuck with
("i'ma let y'all know one thing man")


hell yeah it's on, you better tell 'em
ice cube and i'm rolling with the motherfuckin' l.m
it's the number one crew in the area
make a move for your gat and i'll bury ya
ashes to ashes, dirt to dirt
punks roll when i put in work
'cause lench mob niggas are the craziest
and y'all motherfuckers can't fade my shit
south central, that's where the lench mob dwell
hittin' fools up with the big ass l
one time can't hold me back
sweatshirt, khakis and croaker sacs
stop givin' juice to the raiders
cause al davis never paid us
i hope he wear a vest
it's all about the l-e-n-c-h y'all know the rest
muthafuckin' crew, muthafuckin' mob
do a muthafuckin' job in a muthafuckin' squad
in '91, ice cube grew stronger and bigger
and i'm the wrong nigga to fuck with
("one-and-two, ah-three-e-and-ah-four-and")
("wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute")
drop a old school beat


like i said, it's a brand new payback
now in '91, let's see whose beats get jacked
sir jinx grew a little bit taller
(keep the wack beats out)
true motherfuckin' baller
and hoes can't roll on
even bitches looking like en vogue gotta "hold on"
don't let me catch daryl gates in traffic
i gotta have it, to peel his cap backwards
i hope he wear a vest too, and his best blue
goin' up against the zulu
break his spine like a jellyfish
kick his ass 'til i'm smellin' shit
off with the head, off with the head i say
and watch the devil start kickin'
run around like a chicken
grand dragon finger lickin'
yo, turn him over with a spatula
now we got, kentucky fried cracker
mess with the cube, you get punked quick
pig, cause i'm the wrong nigga to fuck with
