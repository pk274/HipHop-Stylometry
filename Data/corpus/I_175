fly girls and booze each and every night
crowd rocking rhymes, boy, that's alright
treated like a star as you can see
but just rhyming for the cash money
keep the crowd rocking for about b.g
new best believe that's c-o-d
suckers like you don't make no dents
cause it's all about making those dollars and sense
girls on my jock, when i'm up the stage
reports trying to cluck, put me on the front page
c.i.a. in back of me, and cash money is our specialty
boys in the hood keep trying to dig
all girl friends think their heads is big
promoters at the show trying to run that bull'
but odds got pull, get paid in full
gold easy record cause you know it's mine
clean my skeezer with the fu sign
rapping all the time on the us mint
love spending green dead presidents
tv elect, just want respect
show me a cheque, i'll break your neck
hardcore, l.a. not like the past
i rap just for the cash.. money!!
