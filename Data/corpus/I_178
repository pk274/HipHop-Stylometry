sister souljah, hold your fucking ground like i told ya
cause them crackers them try to run ya over
sitting in front of my house in a nova
on your walkie-talkie, why do you stalk me?
cause the jungle bunny's got money, that's not funny to the feds
cut my curl and i might grow dreads
taking heads, devil, step in the pulpit
cause non-violence: that's a bunch of bullshit
in '92, ice cube come a little bit blacker
buck-buck-buck-buck-buck down the cracker
see ya driving in your cadillac-er
through south central and i just might jack ya


cause you teach, freedom of speech
as long as black men don't say howard beach
rodney king or bensonhurst
tawana and tasha, we ain't forgot ya
don't say jew or korean
it's acting like a bad human bein'
they'll try to call you a demon
don't know what the fuck ice cube is sayin'
get off my dick, i might spray you with the semen
me know the answer: come, come down black panther
to the youth, an eye for an eye
a tooth for a tooth, a gun for a gun
a knife for a knife, and a life for a life, check it
