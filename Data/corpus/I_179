get your ride on, ride on
this ain't the day for you to die on, die on
i'm a nigga that they lie on, lie on
see these shoes you wanna try on, try on
yo, we can go to war with the enemy
all we need is a.k.s and hennessy
this ain't back in the days of tennessee
pull the trigger and release the energy ( *shots* )
see muthafuckas run till they catch one
in the back, and it might cause a cardiac
bitch act like he died and we brought him back
him screamin for his mama and his sister pack
flatline -

they ain't never had a full can of act-right
make me pull out my gat, right
and smoke his muthafuckin ass like a crackpipe

to all my thugs in the house, get your loc on
we can really give a fuck about a broke home
all we care about is bitches we can poke on
nigga, what's that bullshit that you spoke on?
better roll on 'fore we split your whole dome
cause you're fuckin with ice cube the terrible
fuck around, i make your life unbearable
make you live all scary and careful
