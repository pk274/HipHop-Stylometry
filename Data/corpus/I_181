the lakers are magnificent
critics better admit it
we winning, shoot it, pivot
with less than a second left and it swishes
don’t test us, you know how vicious
artest is, leavin' the celtics cryin'
like lebron when the magic gave em that ass whippin'
lake show you know we down for the kill
score numbers greater than gallons lost in that bp oil spill
paul’s pie gets pierced by the king of the kings
rondo’s obsessed like schmegal with the lord of the rings
his name was kobe

roscoe umali:
roscoe umali, i reppin' for the lakers
the all time greatest, can't nobody fade us
i do it for the jersey that be hangin' from the staples
jabbar, west, magic, worthy, chamberlain and baylor
fisher, pau and bynum got championship rings with diamonds
while the homies ron artest to run the defensive assignments
bench mobbin' odom, the black mamba kobe
we parade on figueroa with the championship trophy




new boyz:
we the best it's so. how you ain’t a fan by now bro?
laker’s over there head like it shannon brown dunk
anybody stepping up, we getting rid of them lanes
say lebron needs verizon, he ain’t getting a ring
play la and it’s over for sure
tell them boston leprechauns that them clovers don’t work
the lakers win another championship
that’s why we got d fisher to keep on reelin' 'em in

ray j

new boyz:
ok i’m ballin, yeah i’m ballin
them fouls you can’t be callin’
watch you in it girl
league my n---- we be on that spartan
number one and you can call in
we put that ass to bed
buzzer shot game winnin'
derek fisher, ron artest, kobe bryant on they head
we call that dude the man
catch us up in la reppin with my laker fans
purple and gold, yeah we smashed 'em up and they gone
lakers took the whole series and the rest went home

ice cube:
i’m down on the floor, i’m in my suite
it’s goin be sweet to watch the lakers
repeat i’m down on the floor, i’m in my suite
yell "beat la!" and get boston beat
cleveland or boston
cleveland or boston
glad we playin' boston, put they ass in a coffin
watch kobe bryant off 'em in the finals so often
always on fire. keep 'em chunkin' and coughin'

off that california purple
(off that, off that, off that, off that) california purple x4
