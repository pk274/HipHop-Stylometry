what's up baller, i'm a owner now
you niggas ball for me
and i be kickin' it up in my suite
lookin' down, ain't none of y'all fuckin' with me
i'm like a bully that you mother fuckers hatin' to see
better whisper my name, like the wizard of oz
if you say it 3 times, a lyrical barrage
this is not a mirage, there's no way to dodge
this career ending, metaphor collage
i'm swearing to god, this worse than jihad
fuckin' with cube is like the book of eli
i'm pullin' my blade, i'm slicing you bastards
you local motherfuckas, i rap to the masses
you internet bitches, my pen is so vicious
the genie's out the bottle, ain't grant no wishes
before you attack, you shoulda asked mac
he woulda told you i'm the architect of gangsta rap
(kill 'em)


ice cube bomaye! (yeah), bomaye!
ice cube bomaye! (kill 'em!), bomaye!
ice cube bomaye! bomaye!
ice cube bomaye! (kill 'em!), bomaye!


you mother fuckers in the d league, i'm in the g league
i got the most money, i smoke the best weed
i got the best kids and the best life
with a fine wife, nigga i'm in paradise
amateurs think it's easy
but you and that bitch ain't about to be the next george and weezy
just, haters see me
i'm a pro with a show, that's incredible
you better let it go
better learn how to do the dougie
'fore i wrap you in a sunggie
and push you in a buggy
this is ice cube, know the people love me
on some spiritual shit, like the man above me
come on

ice cube bomaye! (yeah), bomaye!
ice cube bomaye! (kill 'em!), bomaye!
