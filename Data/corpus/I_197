at which there is, a little surprise
that stupid ass bitch


yo, it ain't my fault you got the heebie-jibbies
but you still try to act like you didn't see me
so i walk over, and say "hi
bitch, don't try to act surprised"
you shoulda put a sock on the pickle
and your pussy wouldn't be blowin' smoke signals
man, this is gonna kill 'em
guess who got a big fat dose of penicillin?
they'll ask, "who?", and i tell 'em you
the new leader of the big booty crew
and after today, i'm sorry to say
you come through the neighborhood, you couldn't give it away
to a nigga, who's out to get major paid
but you'll have him, pissin' out razorblades
but a bitch like you'll be returnin' with the hiv, rip
