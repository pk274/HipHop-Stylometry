yo, we in a fight for our lives
we in a fight for our lives
and the trip thing about it
i don't know if we can win
and what's sad.. i don't think we wanna win


can you help me? a nigga need a job
i'm desperate, for some corn on the cob
i'm helpless, will i have to steal and rob?
no black business so i got to ask bob
bob got a job but it's done by a robot
no lunch break so it can do a whole lot
mo' than a human being, and it's european
ran by a korean-american
so there i am, surrounded by aluminum
it's nowhere you can run
it's nowhere you can be
it's just you and me, versus modern day machinery


i'm a fly caught in a web
a fish stuck in the internet
don't they know i'm a deadly catch?
eat this meat, every bite so full of stress
so what can i say to you?
i'm highly relatable and bio-degradable
i thought we was unfadeable
slaves to machinery, is that the way to go?
i don't need you to fuck
24-7, i gets that computer love
i don't need you to love
human contact, ain't what it used to was


it's man vs. machine, baby
my head's in the guillotine, baby
and it took it off clean, baby
automated dreams equals man vs. machine, baby
