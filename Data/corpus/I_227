i be what is known as a bandit
you gotta hand it to me when you truly understand it
cause if you fail to see, read it in braille
it'll still be funky, so what's next is the flex
of a genius, my rapid-stutter-stepping if you seen this
dope, you hope that i don't really mean this
but if play made a greater high-top fade
it's not my trademark when i get loose in the dark
you guess it was a test of a different style
it's just another dope brother on the pile
driving around with the flow of the tongue
you hung yourself shortly after knowledge was brung
to your attention, by the hardest rapping artist
that is known for lynching any sucker in a minute
stagger 'em all
when i start flowing like niagara falls
ice cube is equipped to rip it up in a battle
move like a snake when i'm mad; and then my tail rattle
i get low on the flow so let your kids know
when i bust, parental discretion is a must
