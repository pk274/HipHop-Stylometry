i be what is known as a bandit
you gotta hand it to me when you truly understand it
'cause if you fail to see — read it in braille, it'll still be funky
so what's next is the flex of a genius
my rapid-stutter-steppin' if you seen this
dope, you hope that i don't really mean this
but if play made a greater high-top fade
it's not my trademark when i get loose in the dark
you guessed it was a test of a different style
it's just another muthafucka on the pile
drivin' your ass with the flow of the tongue
you hung yourself shortly after knowledge was brung to your attention
by the hardest muthafuckin' artist that is known for lynchin'
any sucka in a minute — stagger 'em all!
when i start flowin' like niagara falls
ice cube is equipped to rip shit in a battle
move like a snake when i'm mad, and then my tail rattle
i get low on the flow, so let your kids know
when i bust, parental discretion is a must!
