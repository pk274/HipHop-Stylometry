eye to eye in f*cking traffic or we collide
all i know up in this world is to survive
take this money, take his girl and take his life
and i don't wanna, all i wanna do is bend the corner to the avenue's
without one running up against the ooze
mammy get the bad news, cousins already begging for my tennis shoes
i got the diggy diggy daz rindin' shotgun, see them hoes over there watching knock him, cock it back and pop some
pull up to the left, and cube pull up to the right
step up to your b*cth get up hope, that's what's she like
a doggpound nigga going hard for the cheese, with my nigga cube nigga
so you know it's bitch please

on the mission just to get it, i get it and then i flip it
