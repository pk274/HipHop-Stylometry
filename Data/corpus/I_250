if you got a herringbone, "welcome to the terrordome"
two-eleven, sorry, reverend

'cause i'm a motherfuckin' g
'cause i'm a motherfuckin'...

thirty in a holding tank, catch the vapors
make me a pillow out of toilet paper
concrete bench kickin' off the hemorrhoids;
éses deep, don't fuck with them boys
phone check, collect call from the baller
her mama said, "please don't call her"
do-wah-diddy, far from new jack city
seen one of my peers, "what the fuck you doin' in here?"
he said, "one-eighty-seven on the enemy
and they treat me like i just shot a kennedy!"
deputy bitch thinks she's the queen bee
ink on my thumb, index, and pinky
"sir, what set you from?" play dumb
"general popu-la-tion"
mama, put your house up, and i can bounce up
out this motherfucker, that's why i love ya
out like a boss, with a half-pint of sauce
got the shit sewed up like betsy ross
what a friend know? buy some indo

so don't run up with ya gun up
'cause i got the backbreaker, double pump rump shaker
'cause we can play hookie in the aqua boogie
with concrete nikes, ya gets no stripes
living unforgiven with the mic on
and punks running like roaches with the light on
and that's all the shit i'm starting
bust a cap (ka-kow-pow!) like jerome on martin
you looking for a punk with benefits
'cause you got a baby, that take many shits
and you know i got a grip like a baby on a tit
scopin', hopin', thighs open
but i kick back, sit back, and hit the phillie slow
hooker hoe, really doe
