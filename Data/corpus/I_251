i tell you no lies, please recognize
i'll serve your monkey ass, two piece and some fries
niggas realize, it's not a disguise
this hardcore shit will make your home girl strip
make you wanna take a sip of that red cup
guess what, rest up, don't give a fuck
never did, small shit is irrelevant
heaven knows only live for the hell of it
know the elephant, hate anything celibate
don't really give a damn, what i tell a bitch
home going to the moon might see you soon
try to get the outlaw out the saloon
hear the click clack first then you hear the boom
get the fuck off my clap, mushroom
get out my face fore' i drop you
don't try to gamble, with earl campbell (nah-ah)
i scramble your eggs boy
replace your arms with your motherfucking legs boy
they call me dexter, dave hester, clyde drexler
mma, you's a wrestler

i don't know why these suckers is frontin'
like they ain't runnin' and duckin'
with my team start that buckin' and fuckin'
that's what happen when you get somethin' from nothin'
any motherfuckers that wanna kick it done out in public
omg motherfucker and it's good to be home
and i say sorry for the wait but i was burning the throne
it's time to take shit, (take that shit) got no time for the hate bitch
they talk shit, cause they ain't shit (real talk)
it's that rise of the ape shit
with no cesar, catch me rocking the pro
like i'm on that number 8 shit
niggas in the back wit their traps upon their hats
and they guess they pack all black
they'll take your racks on racks on racks nigga
thank god the gangster's back
and we ain't gotta put up with this brainless rap
oh my goodness, omg and i'm reckless in the booth
and i ain't never been less than the truth, motherfucker!
