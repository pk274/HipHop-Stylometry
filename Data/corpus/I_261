scared little nigga, scared (scared)
scared that the devil won't let you shovel
like a slave, your own fucking grave
scared little nigga, scared (scared)
scared to think, scared to drink kool-aid
made by your poor black mama, scared of the drama
scared little niggas
scared that the powers that be, will see 'd'
black as me, you scared little nigga, scared (scared)
scared, don't wanna be associated, easily intimidated
hated when we were segregated from whitey, the almighty
scared little niggas hollering "jesus, jesus, jesus"
but mad to find out that he's us
scared little niggas, scared (scared)
scared, what you're gonna do on that day
when the usa ain't ran by the ofay
scared little nigga
