i'm spittin' pollaseeds
i'm spittin' pollaseeds
i'm spittin' pollaseeds
i'm spittin' pollaseeds

i'm spittin' pollaseeds
these niggas is too salty
i'm spittin' pollaseeds
crack 'em one by one
you niggas got me fucked up


fuck a ghostwriter, sittin' in the back
of the studio tryin' to write a nigga rap
it's the muppet show, most niggas need a&r
to tell 'em how to fuck a ho
ice cube, true emcee
write everything i say, even back in the day
i'mma spit it how i feel it, fuck a gimmick
you can keep your catchy lines, i'm bout to write a rhyme
if you got a backpack tryin' to act black
think you know the culture? you's a fuckin' vulture
you never approached a mic
you're dressed like a dyke sayin' what ya don't like
who deserve 5 mics, who deserve 2
but the nigga with 2 still can serve you
this west coast flow is different than the east
but it ain't no different in the street


i'm spittin' pollaseeds on the porch with the torch
in case these niggas come around to see the porsche
when i brandish, motherfuckers vanish
they don't understand like a nigga speakin' spanish
no comprende, me no speak no engle
here (*slap*) now yo' ass feelin' tingly
now you're doin' shit like darryl stingley
don't get stung by the motherfuckin' stingray
jumpin' over niggas, y'all better king me
put your rap careers up on ebay
crazy toones is the motherfuckin' dj
baby drop to your knees, he deserves a bj
i got a big brother nicknamed cj
when you see him in the hood take it easy
if you a breezy, take him to the heezy
do him like halle berry did michael ealy
