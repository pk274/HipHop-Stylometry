what up, locs? put your yoke around a can that's big and black
and cool like that
when you're at home at the crizzib
don't hesitate to pop the lizzid
that's what i'm doing 'cause i'm able
put my chucks on the coffee table
ain't going nowhere 'cause i know that the boys are waitin'
for me to spin my daytons
never got a 5-o-2
never act like a damn fool with st. ides brew
rollin' through the hood like a wicked mack
what you got on a six-pack?
now, if you're short, shorter than short, grab the short can s-t
or the 4-o o-z
ain't nothin' to it, you knew it
fool, you know how we do it
