keep yo' head up, fuck what they said cause
you can do it and the man will get you through it
i believe that, homey i believe that
if i can picture that, i'll bring a picture back


they say "gangster, gangster! tell me how you do it
how you get through it and them other niggas blew it"
i keep my eye on the prize then pursue it
chase it like a cheetah choke it out and subdue it

the game don't change just the players
the rhymes don't change just the fuckin rhymesayers

or change your whole life, in a major way

you know what? momma said it'd be days like this
straight hell on earth, but come up out the abyss
she said "don't let 'em see you crawl, don't let 'em see you fall
all they wanna do is laugh when you tear your drawers"
it's a cold world nigga bring a bomber jacket
if it's another hustle out there i'mma crack it
fuck the new dance i'mma learn how to eat
get my mind right, stay up out these fuckin streets
they keep callin me
they keep callin, all the lil' homies keep fallin
in them same traps niggas cain't figure out
in the fast lane boy but the bridge is out
make my blood boil, get yo' life spoiled
get you in the system, get you in the soil
and your funeral was sponsored by unocal
saw you uvn, nigga digital


to all my people goin through it on a daily basis

they want us to quit, forget
and not give a shit about these sick-ass politics
a lunatic is in the white house
make me wanna go do a lick right now
but they'll make a nigga bow down
in the penitentiary, a billion dollar industry
