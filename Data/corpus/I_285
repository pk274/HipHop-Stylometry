ooh, ooh, ooh
when the cold wind blows in the heart of the city and i'm gone
i know the streets will shed tears for me
when my story is over and my song is done
i know the streets will shed tears for me
the end


all i get is motherfuckin' love in these streets
to most of these tricks i'm a motherfuckin' treat
what's beef? i ain't got no beef
see all that bitchin'? it taste like chicken
and all these chickens? they get plucked
and nobody wants to see the volcano erupt
i'm down with daz 'cause everythang is kurupt
i'm celebrated every time i pull up
you hella hated, every time you look up
i'm elevated to rapper's deluxe
they love me, dawg, 'cause i'm one of a kind
this is god's plan, homie, it ain't mine
see, this ain't about dyin', it's all about shinin'
it's all about climbin' a hill full of diamonds
i know that you feel it, i know that you felt it
'cause a nigga gon' live 'til a nigga can't help it


when the cold wind blows in the heart of the city and i'm gone
i know the streets will shed tears for me
(they love me, dawg)
when my story is over and my song is done
(they love me, dawg)
i know the streets will shed tears for me
the end


sorry, y'all, i ain't got no haters
all i got is mother fuckers tellin' me i'm the greatest
all i got is those fly ass suits and gators
nobody servin' cube but maids and waiters
nobody tryin' to take my life
all these bitches tryna do is replace my wife
but you hoes ain't cold enough to fuck with ice
like kim she'll run circles 'round you bitches twice
now, it might get funky but it won't get ugly
niggas might not like me but they still love me
niggas might talk shit, they whisper and huddle
'cause they know my rebuttal might leave a puddle
now the streets is talkin' until they see me walkin' up the block, then all the bullshit stop
anything i do, don't take it personal 'cause when a nigga gone, that shit ain't reversible


when the cold wind blows in the heart of the city and i'm gone
i know the streets will shed tears for me
(they love me, dawg)
when my story is over and my song is done
(they love me, dawg)
i know the streets will shed tears for me
the end



i'm the bastard that spit the acid
fuck a funeral home and a casket
fuck a funeral song and a procession
keep god on your dome and count your blessings
keep the hood in your heart but heaven on your mind
shake 'em up and roll seven every time
pick 'em up, yup, stick 'em up
every time you see me got a different color cup
this ain't about dyin', it's all about livin'
it's all about makin' everyday thanksgivin'
it's all about givin', about stayin' driven
it ain't about you, it's about these children
so when a nigga die, stop cryin' and ventin'
will somebody in here bump george clinton?
will somebody in here hug my fam?
don't worry about me, you know where i am


when the cold wind blows in the heart of the city and i'm gone
i know the streets will shed tears for me
(they love me, dawg)
when my story is over and my song is done
(they love me, dawg)
i know the streets will shed tears for me
the end
