i see you, over there, lookin like somethin wrong
cause i'm over here, sittin on some chrome
shotgun to the dome
bend a corner wit me


when shit get boring, i jump in some foreign
explorin through my neighborhood, all to the good
ain't the finest order riches
still got ordinary bitches to jehovah's witness
tryin to get wit this
know i got the green thumb, hustler you never seen one
extreme fun, wit this mean one
but you'll never get none fuckin wit them broke hoes
pinnochios, fuck around and get a broke nose
that's ya fate when we congregate
it's the great writer, exponium big spider
tighter than virgin cocks, at the mall like dispurge a lot
like these niggas servin rocks
but i'm servin rhymes, two cds at a time
like it's weight, ice cube the great


this one is strictly, for niggas rollin 750s
and it's polished from the 60s
bumpin that cube shit, do shit, i bet the wheels fall off
before the skills fall off
throw up the dub, got more cocks to rub
and if you don't, i done got this far without yo love
hoes want the nigga in the t-shirt and rolex
and y'all still get the .9 up out the kotex
got the o.z., and the x.o
broads get fatal, and don't wanna let go
incredible, nigga who you rap like?
come out the movie, who you act like?
it's the don, still rappin 2000 and beyond
tryin to come up on another million
