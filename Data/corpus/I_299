hey, living in a california cage
y'all trying to study me?
gangbangin'll never die, it's too much love
you always gonna get niggas like us, you know what i mean
god damn
how many more motherfuckin' penitentiaries y'all gon' build?
how many jars you gonna try to put us in?
you know what i'm sayin'?


can't none of y'all niggas fuck with none of these niggas
these triggers, we's killers (hahaha)
sittin' on the porch in between legs
with a bitch french-braiding my hair, nahhh!
leave 'em til they matted forearm tatted
what's the connection? bitch, you looking at it
it don't stop, i hit mo' licks than it takes
to get to the center of a blow pop (one, two, three)
and it's gonna take a miracle
to drive a car this color down imperial
yeah, i got heart
but ain't trying to see marcia clark (punk ass nigga!)
so let's wait 'til it get dark
so many cars parked in my gate (*beep-beep!*)
it's like the international, house of pancakes (ugh!)
all on the grass (ugh!), every bitch passed (ugh!)
i'm first, not last, when we all hit the ass (ahh)
doin' tricks jacked up like a six (what!)
one pussy, and thirteen dicks
gangstas don't dance, we boogie (bow!)
niggas run out and get ya cookie
westside


the gangsta, the killa, and the dope dealer (yeah!)
the gangsta, the killa, and the dope dealer (yeah!)
the gangsta, the killa, and the dope dealer (yeah!)
the gangsta, the killa, and the dope dealer (what's crackin'?!)


damn, it's a trip, haha
all these cameras goin' up
i can't go here, i can't go there
i feel institutionalized
and i'm on the streets
