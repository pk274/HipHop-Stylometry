we ice cube, the west coast warlord. i got my sons omg and doughboy in the house. we got the king of rock, reverend run, in the house with his sons diggy and jojo. let's go


if my two sons hate you, i’ma violate you
give you that motherfuckin' broken bottle facial
this ain't racial, your new name is rachel
got homies in the pen that might wanna date you
i’ll under-rate you then annihilate you
like the fucking therapist that said i had a breakthrough
this is what i live for, this is called survival
all my rivals are dead on arrival
this is a revival, better bring your bible
the lyrics that i kick is something you might die for
i’m not libel, homie, i’m the dope
nope, that’s a typo, homie, i’m the pope
west coast pyscho on a motorcycle
dressed like michael, it ain't halloween
my city’s so mean, i’m idi amin
i’m the bakers man, got the cake and the cream
