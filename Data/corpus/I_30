gun blast, onĞµ ass, nigga, what ya doin'?
you fuckin' with j.r. ewing - muthafucka, who you think you're screwin'?
i got enough shit brĞµwin' to leave blood in your urine
when the west coast say it, muthafuckas do it
if i had a brick wall, you'd run right through it
like your ass greg pruitt, fold through it
my shit work, just like drew it
and it ain't nothin' to it, nigga, full steam ahead
i'll retire when i'm dead
if the word keep spinnin' and i keep on sinnin'
will i reach my end before my beginnin'?
would the devil keep grinnin' at my black ass?
i ain't the one on tv, lookin' like a jackass
i'm jumpin' jack flash, jumpin' on cash
humpin' on ass, dumpin' four mags

it take a nation of niggas to hold us back
it take a 12-gauge shell to blow your back
it take a dumb ass bitch to hold a sack
it take a nigga like me, i'm a maniac
i'm a maniac, i'm a maniac
call me brainiac, niggas chain react
i'm arrangin' that - nigga, lay ya flat
niggas hatin' that, 'cause i ain't got to rap
it goes one for the money, two for the show
three for the pussy, four for the glow
five for the rookies, six for the pros
seven for the numbers of them fuckin' zeroes
eight for the haters, nine for the cause
ten for my niggas behind big walls
fuck these devils and these laws
never question the size of ice cube's balls

fuck the law, you a beast with a badge
hope that you get a hot piece in ya ass (in ya ass)
stickin' dick to your partner's wife
that's how he got shot on that mysterious night
now, i knew a nigga named officer white
he was pushin' that white out of a black-and-a-white
and if you didn't act right, he'd come in and knock
niggas head with crack, meet officer black, ya know
denzel didn't have to act
all had to do was step back and watch maniac
chain react, watch my cranium crack
watch these muthafuckas lie and claim i'm on crack
george bush is like damien's back
can't trust no republican or democrat
do i wonder if they care about my black ass?
who gives a fuck, a nigga still gotta stack cash
