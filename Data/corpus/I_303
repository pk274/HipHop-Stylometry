well here i go again, throwin' up the w
ice cube and i'm down wit' e-double crew
pullin' up in my homie's black 6-4
hittin' switches but mine's a convertible
mashed to the westside, still got the deuce-deuce
'cause some niggas don't believe in a gang truce
heard some new shit, what is this?
epmd is goin' out of business?
goddamnit! can't leave my dog stranded
(who?) the green eyed bandit
picked up kam 'cause my nigga need a ride
bumpin' "peace treaty" but still had the 4-5
glock, cocked for the clown
yeah, we down, pulled up in echo sound
don't you know that we can drop 10 of these
dope tracks, so fuck all my enemies
cross 'em out and put a 'k'
