"in the deep and dark bowels of the underworld
order must be maintained
without a strict and unforgiving chain of command
chaos is inevitable."
whassup youngsta?
since you the new booty, and don't know nothin
i got to show you bout the peckin order
it's the order in how we do things and move things
see, somebody gon' tell you what to do
after i tell that motherfucker what to do
it's the peckin order (*echo*)
it's the peckin order (*echo*)


we got the power to make you niggas sour
big fish whale like ichikowa, steppin out the shower
it's the peckin order, ask ya daugther how we peck
inspect, high class ass to projects
push my lex through the california rain, gutter lane
infamous schemes on the brain
for my connect gang, put a strain on every link
in our chain, that's right - we all get arraigned
takin sworn notes to makin c-notes
knowin all the while that bullshit floats and niggas don't
so nigga don't - gangsta paradise ain't nuttin nice
yeah we livin so trife we need je-sus in our life


it's the peckin order
it's the order how we do things
and move things, only fuck with the true things


havin heavy intercourse with the world of depression
messin with the wrong bitches never learn our lesson
stressin, no guessin, never question
even when we playin, we testin, confession
do you still wanna meet where the killers eat?
held accountable for anythang you repeat
it's the peckin order, ask your daughter how we peck
when we smoke you, it's your best friend you suspect


it's the peckin order
it's the order how we do things
and move things, only fuck with the true things
