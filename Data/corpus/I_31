you, you've got to be strong
somehow we'll find a way, make it stay
we the big boys sonny
we'll make it stay
you can't play on this level
uh uh


i'm a big boy, like power 106
but the difference is, i can see my dick
we like pseudonyms, we don't look the same
but we mean the same, we both got game
see you little boys run, when these big boys come
big noise from these big toy guns
makin' sure that our dicks have fun
you know a lot of bitches, but you can't trick one
i'm like superman, we're super big though
you just irritatin', like shaq's big toe
you just a nigga hatin', so stay over there
before i have to lay you down from way over here
see a lot of mcs say "damn, you mean"
treat 'em like a jv expansion team
you can't play on this level, we the big timers
i'll send your bitch ass back to the minors, you know


nothing is larger
i'm in charge-ah
if ya wanna parta make the big boys a part of
the situation
and we'll light it up with no hesitation (you know)
no others greater, regulator
we the big boys
two steps ahead of all the time wasters
you're fuckin' with the big boys
daily hoes chase us, no one can face us
never will replace us, (let me tell you somethin'), so just embrace us


black money ain't always crack money
i stack money, bitch, it's act money
don't act funny, ho, it's rap money
'cause black momma, don't raise no black dummy
just because i love chicken and watermelon
talk broken english and drug sellin'
i'm a thug 'bellin', with the crips and the bloods yellin'
"cube how the fuck you get to heaven?"
i keep big heat
with big feet on exts
gettin' my cash, heat in the stash
comin' prepared with one in the air
blowin' with the don mega and butch cassidy
i got a big boy circle
and big boys
