to fuck with ice cube
you gotta shit talk, big talk, crip walk
bang hard, run yards, flip cars
'cause you fuckin' with millionaires, big stars
only clockin' a grip will make our dicks hard
i come through when i handle my business
like a goddamn menace
niggas think i eat spinach
'cause you need a dentist whenever i finish
it's the grin-ich, with a gang of lieutenants
westside!
connec-tion is the campaign
niggas tryin' to run shit, pull a hamstring
i'mma do the damn thang, baby, do the damn thang
dance!
ass bustin' out them pants
i can't stand it, ram it like the animal planet
the kinda nigga that'd take janet for granted
ice cube got that shit that you grew up on
blew up on, got a lawsuit at home
it's a shark in the swimming pool
bad news comin' through on them 22's
and i'm huntin' you out, little kids got to run in the house
i'm dirty like the south, with a gun in your mouth
click click
nigga bang bang for that blang blang
nigga get about as insane as saddam hussein
give a fuck if he got him a gang, he outta my range
give her shit stains when i get brains, nigga
