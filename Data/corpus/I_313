 
the world belongs to me, niggas don't know my pedigree
double-u, ess to the cee
we be them hogs that make it rain cats and dogs
we've got the bud just like them frogs
now everybody on the west, show some love
and everybody on the east, respect the corniche
it's not on lease, breaking laws, swimming through the water like jaws
gumby's pause, and take they drawers, no balls
god damn it, niggers' take my planet for granted, i can't stand it
catch a flight across the atlantic
step off the plane, nothing but expense of the game
bitch, i'm rich, you know my name, show me the cane
now are you sure, one hundred percent pure
cause if it's not, believe me the shit's getting hot
i've got a plot to make your whole family deaf dumb and blind
(tell em one more time), the world is mine

  
it's a quarter to eight, i'm not finished my plate
i've got a phone call to make, my niggers' tell me it's fake
oh, what a mistake, here's what i want you to break
tie his feet with some weight, throw his ass in a lake
and then set up a date between me and his mate
tell her lobster and steak, and, bitch, don't be late
oh, the pussy was great, i'm still sealing your fate
cause you can't imitate, the nigga you love to hate

 
can i grin, show my fin, i'm down with mack 10
dub c, k dee, and kausion
it don't stop, niggers' get to bowing a lot
when we enter the spot, look all the niggers' we got
worldwide, nigga, take a look outside
got a brother named clyde, he's like jekyll and hyde
ice cube is the lick, west side is the clique
(can't get enough of this gangster shit)
you want to check our caj√≥ns, we've got the fed's up on us
we've got to roll on daytona's because we know that they want us
and if they catch us in rap, it's a reasonable doubt
my niggers' pointing me out, my momma screams and she shouts
but we've got enough green from our triple beam
to hire the prosecution and the dream team
this world ain't nothing but a dollar sign
i'm a partner in crime, the world is mine

  
m: we're tight, ha ha, where you from, nigga
where you from, nigga
k: tell them one more time c: the world is mine (4x)
