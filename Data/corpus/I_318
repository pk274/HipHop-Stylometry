too big, like mc hammer hypeman (hypeman)
lit, like thunderin' and lightning (lightning)
chicken, like foster farm or tyson (tyson)
more jewelry than a judge, call me iceland (iceland)
i'm crackin' like the clash of the titans
two bitches give me head while i'm drivin'
i kick a nigga ass with my left foot
but slap the shit out a nigga with my right hand
uh, she said it's too big
damn, nigga, you knocked off two wigs (aw, shit)
i had to say, "i'm sorry"
little red corvette, now it's a ferrari
we don't want her, take her back, you can come get hеr
we keep goin' like some old-ass young niggas
smokе too much (smokin'), fuck too much (fuckin')
we havin' too much fun, but it's not enough


a snotty-nose, ghetto, little child (little child)
i've been in the game for a while (for a while)
they love me in the bay and southern cal' (southern cal')
rappers soak up all my game like a shamwow
twenty-plus years, yeah, i'm legendary
always go big when it's necessary
you doin' what? i'm smokin' on that cali
when i'm pullin' up, certified, true enough
here i come, return of the shogun
i'm a giant, fee-fi-fo-fum
i'm defiant, you a client
you still a customer, we in a riot
if you meet one of us, it's like heaven
you wanna hang out with a legend (dreamin')
if you meet all four, you might poop (shit)
you think you cool enough to smoke with snoop?


too much game for the brain (for the brain)
i could sell the stock exchange some change (some change)
i own three or four different strains (different strains)
you can find me at the shootin' range (shootin' range)
bigger pants with bigger pockets
to hold a nigga stash and a couple rockets
just in case a nigga wanna try the dogg
catch him in the mornin' while he tryna jog
and if we catch you in the mornin', it won't be a warnin'
it might be a doorman, nigga, we important
extra large, wide as the boulevard
bogard, blow you out like a pullin' guard
you fuckin' up if you think i'm lame
i got it, you ain't gotta give me game
tell 'em, slow your roll, calm down
you got a studio? we got compounds
