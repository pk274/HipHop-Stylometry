big subwoofer, big titty hooker
cocaine cooker, rooftop looker
looked out and saw t.j. hooker
jumped off the roof like superfly snuka
you know me, i'm up in it like a booger
then i treat the bitch like some dice and i shook her
i heard this youngin screamin' like a woman
yellin' that they comin', nigga, we ain't runnin'
it's a new day, still got the ak
if these bitches wanna take it back to '88
turn the music down 'fore we lockin' horns
keep the party goin', it's a false alarm
