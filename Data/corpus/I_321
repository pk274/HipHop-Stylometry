smooth
yep
smooth


it's the brotha ya love to hate with a new song
so what really goes on?
nothin' but a come-up, but ain't that a trip
they hate to see a young brotha rich
but i refuse to switch even though
'cause i can't move to the snow
'cause soon as y'all get some dough
ya wanna put a white trick on your elbow
moving out your neighborhood
but i walk through the ghetto, and the flavor's good
little kids jumping on me
but you, you wanna be white and corny
living way out
"fool go home", spray-painted on your house
trying to be a devil, that's true
but ask yourself, who are they to be equal to?
get thе hell out
stop being, a uncle tom, you littlе sell-out
house n---- scum
give something back to the place where you made it from
before you end up broke
mess around, and get your ghetto pass revoked
i ain't saying no names, you know who you are, you little punk
be true to the game


yeah, you ain't nothin' busta, you know that?
i was thinkin' about gettin' you the other day
but i said, "nah"
you know, i knew you grew up in the hood and everything
but you don't come back no more, homie
thinkin' about takin' you out, that's real


when you first start rhyming, it started off slow
but then you start climbing
but it wasn't fast enough i guess
so you gave your other style a test
you was hardcore hip-hop
now look at yourself, boy, you done flip-flopped
giving our music away to the mainstream
don't you know they ain't down with the team?
they just sent they boss over
put a bug in your ear, and now ya crossed over
on mtv, but they don't care
they'll have a new n---- next year
out in the cold
no more white fans, and no more soul
and you might have a heart attack
when you find out the black folks don't want you back
and you know what's worse?
you was just like the sucker in the first verse
stop sellin' out ya race
and wipe that stupid lookin' smile off your face
blacks always gotta show they teeth
now i'ma be brief, be true to the game


look at you, man
used to be cock diesel now pop goes the weasel
i always knew you was a mark, that's on the real, homie
used to be hardcore, now you just went off
it's like they said:
give a dog a bone and watch him go fetch
you went out like a bad knee, fool


a message to the oreo cookie
find a mirror, and take a look, g
do you like what you see?
but you're quick to point the finger at me
you wanna be the big fish, you little guppy
black man can't be no yuppie
you put on your suit and tie, and your big clothes
you don't associate with the negroes
you wanna be just like jack
but jack, is calling you a monkey behind your back
so back off genius
i don't need you to correct my broken english
you know that's right
you ain't white
so stop holding your butt tight
'cause you can't pass
so why you keep trying to pass?
black as a mutha (yo, hold up, loc)
mister big
but in reality, you're shorter than a midge
you only got yourself to blame
get a grip, oreo, and be true to the game


yeah
yo, i wanna say 'what's up' to all the brothas that's true to the game
lench mob, wc and the maad circle, kam, cypress hill, ice cube
that's how we doin' it in '92
fool, be true to the game
