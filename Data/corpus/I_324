i treat a 40 like music, i always turn it up
other beers taste like gas, so burn it up
and let's make another commercial, without rehearsal
pooh do the beat, but first, yo
crack the top off the mellow and smooth
it makes me look cool, and get my girlie in the mood
so let's make a toast to the beer that made it possible
and those other malt liquors, they gots to go
you might see me brag, you might see me sag
you see me with a st. ides in my paper bag
bailin' to the store just to get me another bottle
can't hit lotto, yo, so my motto is to get me a st. ides brew
for me and my crew (and who else?)
oh yeah, pooh
and if you challenge st. ides, you're never gonna win
ice cube is five-thousand so i guess this is the end
