it's the man, it's the myth, it’s the flow, it's the gift, it's the flick (ey)
of this wrist, make the dope so quick
make you hoes so sick, make a nigga go get (okay)
have to down a whole fifth, for i fuck a old bitch
keep this mutherfucker lit, umbrella when i spit
helen keller to your shit, a nigga bailin' with your bitch (okay)
you can't tell a nigga shit, but you can tell a nigga rich
the all-pro, fuck ton-to, its geronimo (woo-eeh)
chop down, tomohawk
swoop down like i'm a hawk (okay)
with 2 bitches ridin' on my dick, like noah's ark
trick, if you wanna start, fired up like jonavar
mutherfuckers in my yard ’cause i’m known for goin' hard-
