this shit is crowded
when the whole place crowded, i’m about it
and when a nigga is about it, don’t doubt it
i’ve got a pocket full of evil, gettin’ love from my people
you don’t wanna see the sequel, if you see it…
everything you wanna be, i’mma be it
everything you wanna do, i’mma do it
the best you ever smoked, i probably grew it
i’m the fluid and i flow like the ocean
this chickens need lotion
even you moisturized bitches need coachin’
i’m so west coastin’, i’m so slow motion
baby wanna put it in my face and crank it open
but baby, just put it in my pocket ’cause it’s open
and please stop hopin’ that a nigga is elopin’
‘cause i ain’t…
i’m goin’ straight to the bank
and if i have another drink it might be the whole tank


this shit is crowded – i’m buffaloing hoes
i’m throwin’ ‘bows in bones, i might break your nose
this shit is crowded – i’m buffaloing hoes
i’m throwin’ ‘bows in bones, i might break your nose
this shit is crowded – i’m buffaloing hoes
i’m throwin’ ‘bows in bones, i might break your nose
this shit is crowded – i’m buffaloing hoes
i’m throwin’ ‘bows in bones, i might break your nose
this shit is crowded


when the whole place crowded, i’m about it
and when a nigga is about it, don’t doubt it
i like it wet and sweaty, hot as the serengeti
busting nuts, busting cherries and it’s on
it ain’t never, ever off
unless you’re talkin’ ’bout the fuckin’ lights in my loft
unless you’re talking about the fucking porsche pulling off
and niggas passin’ out when they smell that exhaust
and it’s on…
i keep it turnt up and burnt up
when you gon’ learn? i’m a head turner
rich as ted turner, fuckin’ tina turner
hope that concern ya, get the fuck out the way
warriors, warriors, please come out and play
you can’t keep up, we in the fuckin’ milky way
and when i come back, these niggas all better pray
it ain’t a good day, i might have my ak




for me, mc means “move the crowd”
for me, mc means “move the crowd”
for me, mc means “move the crowd”
for me, mc means “move the crowd”


we packed – all together
like sweaty ass cracks (sweaty ass cracks)
we packed – all together
like sweaty ass cracks (sweaty ass cracks)
this shit is crowded
i see some of y’all love it
you hope the chick in front of you might try to rub it
but slow the fuck down, ’cause your jeans are too hard
i don’t go stupid, i’m a retard
i’m the one pushin’ when the crowd get to mushin’
and if i stage dive – you my cushion
and when i’m all about it, you can read all about it
five in the shotty when i’m in the building, and…
