she gotta jump up and down just to fit in them jeans
she gotta jump up and down just to fit in them jeans
left cheek (left cheek), right cheek (right cheek)
left cheek (left cheek), right cheek (right cheek, yeah, hahaha)
left cheek (left cheek), right cheek (right cheek, big booty girl)
left cheek (left cheek), right cheek (right cheek, ha-ha-ha, check her out)


shake the right leg (brr), shake the left leg (brr)
jump up and down, fall on the bed
don't start to swear, don't break a nail
try to inhale, tail like a whale
gotta yell for help, fresh out the dryer
this time lil' sister got to use the pliers
get 'em on your ass, no strength left
say "goddamn", bitch out of breath
with each and every step
they fight for position, right cheek fight with the left
it's a struggle tryna hold that bubble
and if she bend over, you in trouble
boy, you might see double (double)
ass everywhere, but she don't love you
just try to get a slice if you able
now you know why they call her ass roundtable
