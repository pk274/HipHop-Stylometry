yo, where the fuck is that little boy at?
stanley, bring your ass here, god damnit (man, fuck you, punk ass nigga)
but anyway man, yo, bone man
when i get fourteen, man, i wanna buy me a rag top tray on some gold things (stanley)
man, fuck that shit, man
you need to take your ass to school, get you a motherfuckin' job and shit
man, fuck that, man, fuck you, man, look here
when i get fourteen, man, i wanna buy me a rag top tray on some gold with a three-wheel motion
chin wheel pull out (ah shit), three finger ring, fat ass link (stanley) and a big booty go bitch to with it
man, fuck all that
break 'em off something
aha, it's really sad
young brothers and sisters today have a lack of understanding on
what it really means to be black


could you tell me who unleashed our animal instinct? (uh)
and the white man sittin' there tickled pink (no shit)
laughin' at us on the avenue
bustin' caps at each other after havin' brew
we can't enjoy ourselves
too busy jealous at each other's wealth (right, right)
but comin' up's just in me
but the black community is full of envy (oh shit)
too much back-stabbin'
while i look out the window i see all the japs grabbin'
every vacant lot in my neighborhood (yup)
build a store, and sell their goods
to the county recips
you know, us po' niggas, nappy hair and big lips? (that's right)
four or five babies on your crotch
and you expect uncle sam to help us out? (shit)
we ain't nothin' but porch monkeys to the average bigot, redneck honky
you say comin' up is a must
but before we can come up, take a look at us


you dumb ass nigga
break 'em off something


and all y'all dope-dealers
you're as bad as the police 'cause ya kill us
you got rich when you started slangin' dope
but you ain't built us a supermarket (so shit)
so when can spend our money with the blacks
too busy buyin' gold and cadillacs (huh)
that's what ya doin' with the money that ya raisin'
exploitin' us like the caucasians did (yup)
for 400 years, i got 400 tears, for 400 peers
died last year from gang-related crimes
that's why i got gang-related rhymes (right)
but when i do a show to kick some facts
us blacks don't know how to act
sometimes i believe the hype, man
we mess it up ourselves and blame the white man
but don't point the finger you jiggaboo
take a look at yourself, ya dumb nigga, you
pretty soon hip hop won't be so nice
no ice cube, just vanilla ice (man, fuck that)
and you'll sit and scream and cuss
but there's no one to blame but us


yeah, but why is it that one motherfucker can ruin it for twenty-two thousand motherfuckers
when they wanna come see a good jam, you know what i'm sayin?
ayy, cube, tell 'em something, shit, you know how i feel?
break 'em off something


us, we'll always sing the blues
'cause all we care about is hairstyles and tennis shoes
and if ya step on mine ya pushed a button
'cause i'll beat you down like it ain't nothin'
just like a beast
but i'm the first nigga to holler out peace, black man
i beat my wife and children to a pulp
when i get drunk and smoke dope
got a bad heart condition
still eat hog-mogs and chitlin's
bet my money on the dice or  the horses
jobless, so i'm a ho for the armed forces
go to church but they tease us
with a picture of a blue-eyed jesus
they used to call me negro
after all this time i'm still bustin' up the chiffarobe
no respect and ignored
and i'm havin' more babies than i really can afford
in jail 'cause i can't pay the mother
held back in life because of my color
now this is just a little summary
of us, but y'all think it's dumb of me
to hold a mirror to ya face, but trust
nobody gives a fuck about
