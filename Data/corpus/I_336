i love this game, yeah
haha, haha, haha
yeah


we be ballin'
everybody likes all the plays we callin'
your team fallin'
we ain't stallin'
we just slammin' and jammin' like it ain't nothin' wrong


(boo-yah!) it's back, the nba's where it's at
we the macks, vip's, watching shaq
stackin' up the numbers, makin' opponents dumber
you oughta check him smarter, or a little harder
now we can ball on land, air and water
got your daughter cheerin' harder than you think she oughta
get the order to slaughter any team like that
jordan, me, and shaq, a dream team pack
watch my man allen i. take it to the rim
two minutes left and we winning by ten
the crowd leavin', we up by a dub
fool, you in my house, you get no love


we be ballin'
everybody likes all the plays we callin'
your team fallin'
we ain't stallin'
we just slammin' and jammin' like it ain't nothin' wrong (bring it)
get your ball on



we be ballin'
everybody likes all the plays we callin'
your team fallin'
we ain't stallin'
we just slammin' and jammin' like it ain't nothin' wrong
get your ball on


you got scorers, we got scorers
you got bangers, we got bangers (we be ballin')
what, that's nothing, what!
(yay-yay)


i'm mvp, so what's up now?
the number two team just touched down
watch me as i clown, opponents all fallin' to the floor
and i'm goin' in for the score
it's quarter number four, they start to push and shove
the skills i possess must come from up above
love for everybody waitin' on us
and scrubs are everybody hatin' on us
debatin' on us, but they only visitin'
ain't tryna come through my house and win
i see you watching me, but i'm the father
and i can take you to the hole like the doctor, watch her
i see her crew gettin' hard
'cause she know that i'm a superstar
they know who we are
we goin' all the way, baby, we done went this far


shake 'em off, shake 'em off, i'm takin' off
for the rim, for the rim, we 'bout to win
shake 'em off, shake 'em off, i'm takin' off
for the rim, for the rim, we 'bout to win
we be ballin', we be ballin', yay-yay
we be ballin', we be ballin'
we be ballin', we be ballin', we be ballin'
