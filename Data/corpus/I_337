taking out the residential global persperation
freaky gyrations close to fornication

intoxication faded inebriated
designated driver liver than macgyver
blocking freaks in all of 'em tens
stallions get them to pile in
sitting on 'lacs, bitch, we write raps

standing all in line with designer umbrellas
bad fellas running with the east side connection
any kind of club with a star check they weapons
who wanna sex dmx? get naked
fucking to security show us the exit
