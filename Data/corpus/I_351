listen to the preacher man
but are you talkin' to me?
i can't hear ya with a mouth full of pigs feet
thy shouldn't eat the swine flesh
ya body is a mess, but ya blessed
with the father, son, spirit, and the holy ghost
but my whole neighborhood is comatose
lookin' for survival
the devil made you a slave
and he gave you a bible
four hundered years of gettin' our ass kicked
by so-called christians and catholics
but i'mma watch 'em burn in the fire
see i'mma g that's why i ain't in ya choir
cause i see, cause i know
the church ain't nothin' but a fashion show
get the devil do a one-eighty-seven


and they won't call me a nigga
when i get to heaven


your waitin' for the devil to come from the ground
clown, take a look around
just look at the cross that the priest is holdin'
a beast, in sheeps clothin'
but i'm rollin'
with that knowledge of self
cause heaven ain't just wealth
so mister preacher
if i couldn't pay my tithe
do i hafta wait outside?
white man, please take another look
cause we couldn't be readin' out the same book
cause you's a crook, and i'm a brotha
king james had sex with his motha
is that your edition? is that your religion?
black men you gotta make a decision
cause god is comin' on day number seven


and they won't call me a nigga
when i get to heaven


the same white man that threw me in the slamma
he bombed a church in alabama
so if i cocked the hammer god won't mind
if i have to kill the human swine
cause god is a killa from the start
why you think, noah had to build his arc
and god is a man from his feet to his hair
that's why you say "amen" after each and every prayer
i just stare at the church man
spendin' more money on the church-van
but elijah's got a plan
got the white man screamin', "damn, that farrakhan"
cause one day these babies'll up rise
much more than bow ties and bean pies
kickin' knowledge at the seven-eleven


...but when it come to standin' up
we find a convenient excuse, to lay down
back away from struggle
