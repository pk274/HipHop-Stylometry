one, two, three and i come with the wicked
style, and you know that i'm from, the wicked
crew, act like you knew
'cause i got everybody jumpin' to the voodoo, kick it
wicked rhymes, picket signs
while me and the mob gotta trunk full of nines
play ya and i'll slay ya
i got the mayor by the hair
ready to buck, buck, buck and it's a must
to duck, duck, duck before i bust
lookin' for the one that did it
but like en vogue, no, you're never gonna get it
'cause i'm the one with the fat mad skills
and i won't choke like the buffalo bills
sittin' at the pad just chillin'
'cause larry parker just got two million, oh what a feelin' (so)
shake that nigga and pass me the pill
and i'll slam dunk ya like shaquille o'neal
like it, dig it, maybe, and watch that test tube baby
kick it, 'cause i get wicked


don't say nothin', just listen
got me a plan to break tyson outta prison
come my way and get served
still got a deuce that'll bunny hop the curb
nappy head, nappy chest, nappy chin
never seen with a happy grin
show the fat frown 'cause i'm down
take a look around
all you see is big black boots steppin'
use my steel toe as a weapon
kick ya and flip ya, now they want to
label this nigga tape with the sticker
diggin' out girls that's nicety
plus i got a body count like ice-t
from here to new york
i get skins and ain't talkin bout pork
swine, pig, dig
listen to the flow of a so-called negro
who didn't know i was funky as wilson pickett
dig it, 'cause i get wicked


people wanna know how come
i got a gat and i'm lookin' out the window like malcolm
ready to bring that noise
kinda trigger happy like the geto boys
april 29th brought power to the people
and we might just see a sequel, 'cause
police got equal hate
a chazzer's a pig that don't fly straight
through with daryl gates but is willie williams
down with the pilgrims?
just a super slave
we'll have to break his ass up like super dave
i'm wicked enough to pull this
'cause now it's on to the fullest
gorilla straight from the mist
but i don't miss when it comes to (uh) this
bring the yellow tape
the white cape, 'cause i'm so straight
through with the picket signs
take this job and stick it, bigot, 'cause i get wicked


wicked man (haha, oh)
hear the— hear the—
hear the— wicked man
hear the drummer get wicked
