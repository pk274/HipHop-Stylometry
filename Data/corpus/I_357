it's the summertime, everybody's getting wine
when you go to the store, could you please make mine
a st. ides, and watch me drink it quick
at the family barbecue or the picnic
'cause it's so hot this time of year
and if you're looking for a brand new beer
grab that s-t-crooked-i, it's ironic
it's not the miller but smooth, it's like the chronic, bionic
and all the homies'll wanna take a sip
of your brews with st. ides and then take a dip
in the shade is where i was
and i'm sorry, lemonade never got me buzzed like this
it feels so good, black
i kinda wish they'd come up with a 12-pack
