step right up, step right up, step right up, son
and try this new beer, but are you over 21?
yes, i am, mister, so please pass the bottle
'cause i've been drinking ever since i could swallow
'kay, one of these are st. ides, we took off the stickers
if you were blindfolded, do you think you could pick it?
the other brand's alright, that may be true, g
but y'all can't fool me 'cause i know the s-t
i-d-e-s has gotta be the best
well, put this blindfold on and take the test
it's greater than alpha beta so i gotta tell a friend
yo pooh, show him what he win
a summertime supply of st. ides
