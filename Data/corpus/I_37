got me a down ass girl on my team
with an infrared beam...
sheeit...westside!


there go the niggas i'm supposed to meet
we gon' do this, yo-yo, slide me the heat
knew they was punks from my very first glance
shakin' niggas hands, waitin' for a chance
"do you got the yay?"
heard a motherfucker say, "right this way"
in they trunks, super chickens, about six
lookin' like bricks, do i got the chips?
hell yeah, in the back of my elco
"can we walk wit' you?" i said "hell no!"
yo-yo, see my .44? grab it
about to let these motherfuckers have it
walk back with my strap, 's' on my chest
let me get a taste test
tongue got numb, then i said "fuck that!
this a motherfuckin' jack..."


run, run, run from the ghetto pigeon
it's all mathematic, weavin' outta traffic
that's the shit i be hatin'
when these fuckin' daytons, get to ice-skating
yo-yo, back seat driving, shut the fuck up
you shut the fuck up, learn how to drive
1995, bonnie & clyde, wanted dead or alive
tryin' to jump out the lapd
headin' up century, fuck the penitentiary
wanna get my shit home to kick it
knew the job was fucked up when i took it
shit is scandalous, '95, latest mobster
shit don't stop, still bustin' out the coppers
nine in my lap, a fo'fo' in my ride
still bendin' corners, 'bout to hit the eastside
straight hoo-ridin', bonnie & clyde'n
all the way live from the westside
when plan b to effect, had to do what's next
hopped out that bitch with the quickness
you know it's all business
