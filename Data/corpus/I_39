'cause bertha butt did her fuckin' boogie with her crew
but i'd rather fuck you, boo
and make you say humdrum, tweedee dum

the disco fiend with the monster sound
i wants to get fucked up when i'm chillin', whoa
the bigger the headache, the bigger the pill-in
you let her funk me cause my funk is the best
comin from the west
kickin that shit be occupied, dedicated to the preservation motion of hips
hittin them dips, cd skips but i'm straight
as i bounce, rock, skate, now i'll toast to that
if it's rough, make the girls say
"do that stuff! aw, do that stuff!"
but ya got to be, you got to be a freak of the week
