the world is mine, nigga, get back
don't fuck with my stack the gauge is racked
about to drop the bomb i'm the motherfuckin' don
big fish in a small pond
now the feds trying to throw they book at the crook
but i shook they worm and they hook
guppies hold they breath. they want to miss me when i'm tipsy
running everything west of the mississippi
its the unseen, pulling strings with my pinky ring
we got your woman, pucker up 'fore we fuck her up
bow down before i make a phone call
got 25 niggas running up on y'all
for the cheese we want them keys
everybody freeze on your knees, butt naked please
before any of you guppies get hard
nigga! rewind my part fool and....(bow down)


(bow down) when i come to your town
(bow down) when i'm westward bound
(bow down) cuz i ain't a hater like you
bow down to a nigga that's greater than you (ooh!)


yeah
ha
let me tell you something
gangsta's make the world go round
so you ain't got to clown
but if you live on the west side of your town
make them other fools bow down
westside connection
the world belongs to us
