you can't trust a big butt and a smile
no, that's the old style
in 
(ice cube comin at'cha with a crazy pitch)
don't trust no (bitch! bitch! bitch!)
(ice cube comin at'cha with a crazy pitch)
you can't trust no (bitch! bitch! bitch!)
(ice cube comin at'cha with a crazy pitch)
don't trust no (bitch! bitch! bitch!)
(ice cube comin at'cha with a crazy pitch)
you can't trust no (bitch! bitch! bitch! bitch!)


here's how the bitches jack:
they try to catch a dumb nigga in the act
you came to the club, stepped to the bar
and pulled out a wad of dubs
after you got buzzed, she walk by
you saw how big her ass was
got her on the dance floor
and she started dancing like a hoe
jimmy got stiff, she ain't have a ride home
so you gave the bitch a lift
she didn't wanna trouble you
but hopped her big ass in your bmw
hopped to her house and started kissing
and jimmy just wouldn't listen
'cause you got real horny
and that ain't cool at four in the morning
started undressing the ho
got to the drawers and the hoe said, "no!
not on the first date
it's getting kinda late, could you come back at eight?"
you said "yeah!" 'cause you thought you met a wholesome hoe
but nigga, she know you rolling in some dough
and you'll regret and something 'bout a bitch you just met
don't trust 'em!

eight o'clock on the dot, nigga's hot
dick hard as a rock
straight on a solo creep
can't wait till her little boy go to sleep
so you can seduce the g
bust a nut and make an excuse to leave
you got her worked out 'cause you the man
but the bitch got diff'rent plans
she said "take off your clothes, jump in the bed"
while she powder her nose
you get butt naked
cause you ready to wreck it
'cause you a motherfucking pro, next thing you know
the door flies open with a blast
with four niggas in ski masks
pointing a gun at the pimp
you're scared as a motherfucker and jimmy done went limp
they beat you down just a taste
take ya to your house and make ya open up the safe
drove you far, tied up in the trunk of your own fucking car
take you out and pop the cap
i told you the bitch was a trap
don't trust 'em!
