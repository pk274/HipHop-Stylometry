we gon' chase down the bully, hit his ass with the fully
chase down the bully hit his ass with the fully
then we gon' string his ass up by his nuts with the pulley
string his ass up by his nuts with the pulley


if you stay ready, you ain't got to get ready
blast like confetti, nigga, cut like a machete
you just spent your fetti on a mother fuckin' chevy
i'm buyin' somethin' heavy, turn the ass into spaghetti
from another planet, no, it's not the serengeti

bitches think this commentary is military
i kill you and i bury you with the steel that i carry
now, if he a fascist, i'ma bash his head in
cock it back, boy, and put the lead in
all you evil forces wit'cha tiki torches
shove 'em up your ass, freaky intercourses
they try to lie, say i'm hearin' voices
apocalypse now, rollin' with the horses
hit the alt-right with a fog light
see that red sheet? used to be all white

and if you think ice cube give a shit about they statues cover them in pigeon shit

on my way home, talkin' on my iphone
mother fuckers tried to kill me with a fuckin' drone
they think i'm al capone with a natural comb
you just a clone of the original chromosome
me? i'm just a student of the terrordome
you? you just recruitin' for the skull and bones
me? i do karate on illuminati
you can view the body
i'm at a pool party


we gon' chase down the bully, hit his ass with the fully
chase down the bully hit his ass with the fully
then we gon' string his ass up by his nuts with the pulley
