here's another day at the stoplight
i'm lookin' in my mirror so i can see who can see me
south central is puttin' ice cube to the test
with four brothers in the ss
now i can't go around and can't back up
so i gotta peep game layin' in the cut
is this a jack or a kidnap?
since i'm never ever slippin', i'm fully strapped
i grab my gat out the glove
do these fools got a problem with me, or do they got love?
and when the light turn green, i don't bone out
i wanna see what these black men are all about
'cause if it's my time, i'm just short
if not, i'm pluggin' they super sport
first they get behind my ride
then they switch lanes to the left side
i'm scopin' out the one smokin' indo
comin' up fast, rollin' down his window
he threw up a sign, i put away my nine
fool, 'cause i'm colorblind


i thought i could get into caring, but if i started caring, then i would get sloppy
