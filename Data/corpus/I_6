what would you do if i punked your whole crew?
would you run like a bitch from me?
niggas don't test 'cause we come from the west
yes the w-s to the c (westside!)
westside, niggas
fuck everybody that used to be down
that ain't down no mo'
y'all niggas ain't from the best side
y'all don't know how we puts it down
trick ass motherfuckers
it's goin down


let's make it happen, nigga, fuck rappin', i'm bellin'
with three time felons, nigga, who you tellin'?
doug llewelyn that a fool sellin
thirty-six ounces what that amounts is
a whole chicken finger licken is the rumor
catch a tumor, you say i'm dickin' my consumer
suede puma's as i walk down florence
with warrants that don't go to court in torrance
tonight i'm buzzin thought i wasn't
mack 10 and w.c. is like my blood cousins
eleven strikes from armed robbery to stolen bikes
a nigga likes your motherfuckin nikes
i shift gears when i see tears
fuck a record, fuck a movie (fuck 'em)
i rack my uzi
on bougie niggas that pretend to be friend to me
we the dopest niggas on hennessy in the industry
i hit a lick well, i'm in a thick cell
gold teeth, two motors and pig tails
and when i hear "westside connection"
i get the fuckin' erection
