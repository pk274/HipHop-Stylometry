let me tell y'all, the definition of shady
it's a nigga like you that think it's all gravy
do some dumb shit, dumber than join the navy
what yo' broke ass doin' with a hundred babies?
strap it on please, you're spreadin' std's
throughout the hood, you's a walkin' disease
you took the bad ones, and you turned 'em into sad ones
bitch you dumb too, fuckin' with the last ones
you's a crazy nigga goin' in and out of there
like you love it, but nigga i'm outta here
when they crack the door, boy i ain't comin' back
i'm tryin' to figure out, why you keep runnin' back?

sick with it, bipolar, crazy as the ayatollah
went in to buy a soda, now we shootin' at the rollers
he looked at me like "cube, i thought you was a soldier"
i am nigga, but not for a coca-cola
jumped out my car when his head hit the tar
it bust like a jar but he still wanted to spar
they jumped out, and hit his ass with the taser
fifty thousand volts turned him into joe frazier
beat they ass, took they badge, took they guns and they cash
came by the bar, nigga rollin' in they squad car
blue and red lights flashin' like a superstar
i just shook my head and wondered who the fuck you are

you've got to be a crack baby, turn into a grown-up
sharp as a bowling ball, brain like a donut
my daddy told me that the early bird get the worm
he told me that the early dope fiend get the sherm
three am, see you ridin' on that bicycle
old motherfucker, what you doin' on that tricycle?
you's a cold motherfucker like a icicle
with your grandmama purse tryin' to buy a nickel
i should kick ya ass just because she can't do it
cause all you do is talk shit and you drink fluid
you say "yeah man, you better get used to it"
they say god is perfect, and i say he blew it
