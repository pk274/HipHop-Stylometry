i'm gonna get you
i'ma get you, i'ma get you
i, i drink (crooked i)
(you know the can is black)
yep
i, i drink (crooked i)
(you know the can is black with the funny)
(crooked i)


introducing crooked i, iced tea and fruit punch
damn, i got the hunch that
all the g's in the house'll be sippin'
it's non-alcoholic so it ain't no trippin'
all natural, you'll still be the man
with your hand around the black can
i wish had the 40 oz
of the crooked i, but an iced tea
better than the rest, i'm steppin' on the stages
crooked i for all ages
ice cube, chillin' on a day that's hotter
can't wait 'til they come with the piña colada
not a malt liquor, never was
'cause some days i don't wanna get buzzed
so walk past the snapple
crooked i's on sale from cali to the big apple
and all the g's drink it
