brrrgh!

in about four seconds, a gangsta will begin to speak


it's off the hook, nigga, i'm a westside crook, nigga
put 40 motherfuckin' dollars on my books, nigga
i'm not a mc, i'm not a g
i mean i'm a-to-fuckin'-z and everythang in between
rappers like gangbangin', 'cause i'm in it to the fullest
and my hood ain't never dodging bullets
it's all about the bloods and crips, dogs and rips
corners and dips, bitches and chips, nigga!


check it! ho shut your mouth and get naked!
i'm connected and ain't no bitches singin on this record
no r&b tracks, just niggas on wax
kickin' facts with these gang-bang raps
every nigga in the industry wanna rap with me
like it's all good, you ain't from my hood
nigga, i don't even like your shit, i don't like your crew
i'm true, you're through, nigga fuck you!


use to get kisses and hugs, now i'm servin ya slugs
fuck b-real and muggs, y'all niggas ain't no fuckin thugs
to your surprise, everybody dies
from columbian neck ties covered with flies
ya fuckin maggots, ya fuckin faggots
i should alert you, every motherfucker that i know wanna hurt you
so when i pull my spray can to spray
i'm sprayin c-h-k all motherfuckin day
