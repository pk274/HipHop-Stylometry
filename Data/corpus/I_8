fresh out of school 'cause i was a high school grad
gots to get a job 'cause i was a high school dad
wish i got paid by rappin' to the nation
but that's not likely, so here's my application
pass it to the man at at&t
'cause when i was in school i got the a.e.e
but there's no sc for this youngsta
i didn't have no money, so now i gotta punch the
clock, gotta slave, and be half a man
but whitey says there's no room for the african
always knew that i would clock g's
but welcome to mcdonald's, "may i take your order, please?"
gotta serve ya food that might give you cancer
'cause my son doesn't take no for an answer
now i pay taxes, that you never give me back
what about diapers, bottles, and similac?
do i have to sell me a whole lotta crack
for decent shelter and clothes on my back?
or should i just wait for help from bush?
or jesse jackson, and operation push?
if you ask me the whole thing needs a douche
a massengill, what the hell
crack will sell in the neighborhood
to the corner house bitches
miss parker, little joe, and todd bridges
or anybody that he know
so i copped me a bird, better known as a kilo
now everybody know i went from po'
to a nigga that got dough
so now you put the feds against me
'cause i couldn't follow the plan of the presidency
i never get love again
but blacks are too fuckin' broke to be republican
now i remember, i used to be cool
'til i stopped fillin' out my w-2
now senators are gettin' high
and your plan against the ghetto backfired
so now you got a pep talk
but sorry, this is our only room to walk
'cause we don't want a drug push
but a bird in the hand is worth more than a bush
