underwater flow, shit is getting deep
them fuckers tried to drown the aqua boogie freak
but i'm a octopus, especially when i got to push
when shit is fishy, my trigger finger get itchy
all you sissies, i'm a general like ulysses
fuck with me, i'm incredible like bill bixby
i never sleep, cut off my eyelids
insomniac, maniac, i'm a hybrid
bitch, i'm a pirate, they call me blackbeard
i sail the seven seas, ho, i'm off the grid
it's the ultimate, baby, i'm the bulk of it
the whole package, a nigga with no baggage
it's kind of tragic when you driving through irvine
is this germany, 1939?
i'm a gangsta boy, not the nerdy kind
they got a dirty mind, all about the dollar sign
