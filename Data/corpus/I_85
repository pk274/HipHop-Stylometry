come on, don’t trip, homie
ice grew up around crips, homie
where you motherfuckers find this phony?
acting hard, he’s a tenderoni
the boulevard to the prison yard, i push this cart
westside rolling, wherever you are
and i been coming up
and ain't none of y'all niggas running up
'cause i'm quick-draw when i'm gunning up
boy you know the sun ain't coming up
lay that ass down (buh-kow!)
tryna milk this cash cow
face down, look at you now, bitch
