ever since he dumped on 'em, homie came back to haunt 'em
ever since he shot 'em, every day it’s autumn
every day is fall, can’t sleep at all
'bout to climb the wall, gotta walk the halls
nigga broke the clause, universal laws (yeah)
now we in them jaws, of them dirty dogs
got 'em dumpin' trash, gotta dump a stash
bullshit lawyer, got 'em dumpin' cash
he ain't johnny cash, he drove a pontiac
shouldn't have mixed the cocaine and the cognac
he was a maniac, in that dump truck
and when the popo's caught him
now he lumped up, nigga slumped up
got thrown in the cell with the wolves and they pumped up
they brought the funk up
yeah, you shot my homeboy
pull out the alloy, and went cowboy
