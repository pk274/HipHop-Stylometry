everythang's corrupt, everythang's fucked up
everythang's 'bout a buck, we shit out of luck
everythang's corrupt, everythang's fucked up
everythang's 'bout a buck, we shit out of luck


go to school, the teacher wanna fuck the students
go to church, my preacher turned to prostitution
the prosecution never read my files
that evil ass judge fell asleep at my trial
this shit is wild, chickens get as sick as the cows
birds fallin out the sky, fish dyin' in piles
its fishy, politicians smell like my bowels
talkin' that shit, really crampin' my styles
i got many, now i'm pinchin' pennies no doubt
i squeezed lincoln so hard, a fuckin' booger came out
its a shame, i used to be on top of my game
they took the shirt off my back and replaced it with chains
i met mr. lee harvey, from the tea party
he used to hate obama til' he felt hurricane charley
looking for his fema check, it's gone with the wind
when em' dicks is in, you know the fix is in


for my birthday, buy me a politician
it's a shame that you got to teach yo' children
everythang's corrupt, everythang's fucked up
everythang's 'bout a buck, we shit out of luck
for my birthday, buy me a politician
it's a shame that you got to teach yo' children
everythang's corrupt, everythang's fucked up

everythang's a scam, beat the next man
that's capitalism, they'll just build a new prison
for you slick ass niggas' that's tryin' to beat the system
put you on the front line if you ain't re-enlisting
it's hot in hell's kitchen, get ready for the lynching
brain-wash media, and puppet politician
keep you out of position, out of commission
by medicine or food, that's not a decision
the 99 percent, is man tryin' to vent
police grab my fuckin' arm, then they got bent
now it's in a splint, i can't pay my rent
the interest on my credit card i ain't made a dent
the u.s mint, i heard they bout' to print
but it's fucked up cause' i won't see a cent
i'm sick of gettin' ignored, this world i can't afford
i'm going to the pen, free room, free board, bitch


for my birthday, buy me a politician
it's a shame that you got to teach yo' children
everythang's corrupt, everythang's fucked up
everythang's 'bout a buck, we shit out of luck
for my birthday, buy me a politician
it's a shame that you got to teach yo' children
everythang's corrupt, everythang's fucked up
everythang's 'bout a buck, we shit out of luck
