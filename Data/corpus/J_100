i thought this was america people
uhh
yeah
guilty until proven innocent huh?
that's how we working huh?
okay
before me there was many
after me there will be none
i am the one
uh-huh
okay, i see how we playing
ye


yeah, i get it down, anxiously the public can't wait
niggas had to have it way before it's release date
jigga get irate, press get it fucked up
took me one point eight but i had to get it straight
get the cd, twelve inch vinyl, get the tape
jigga give out food for thought dog, get a plate
i get it down, get it crunk when i get in the state of mind
that what's mine is mine, nobody get to take
i don't bend, break, fold, scratch, go down
my mental rolodex see these words? i just don't know
i know stress, drama, niggas upsetting my mama
arrested, put in the lineup, trying to put dents in my armor
but i'm a survivor, plus i'm liver than most
out on bail, fifty thou', still riding with toast
i ain't trying to collide with folk
but i don't want folk taking jigga for joke
i guess you niggas just woke - good morning!


i see how you coming at me now, i'm cool
i'm not the snitch, i don't go to the cops to get rich
i go to the block and pitch
i go with the glock and click, i go with the pop i'm sick
i go with you hard, i ain't gon' stop for shit
look in my eyes dog, right in my pupils
if i'm your rival, why would i have to do you?
press try to throw dirt on my name, disturbing my game
seemed happy when they heard he was arraigned, glad he's indicted
i got big money, big lawyers to fight it
just like cochran, cocksuckers you never see me boxed in
y'all all know it, jigga's a fighter
plus i'm claustrophobic, back on the streets before you know it
and my word niggas, i heard you niggas
i'ma address each and every one of you cocksuckers
fuck the white press, the block love us, hip-hop forever
b.i.g. is here, the soul of 2pac hovers - above us


y'all, cats, can't touch me
you can't touch me, no you can't touch me
jigga, kelly, not guilty
try to charge me but i'm not guilty
i got, all, my mamis
i've got all of my mamis
tell me, what you, want from me
tell me.. (uhh, i am the one)
what you want from me? not guilty


uhh, okay, you on my radar, i got you too bitch
got lame bitches trying to fuck with my case
same lame bitch i bust in her face
honey just mad i got her fucking replaced
plus a birthday pass without me even touching my safe
but i ain't gon' lie, the head was sick
but what we need to do, is put that mouth on a better bitch
you heard the rhetoric: "jigga hit me over the head
with a champagne bottle at the bar, can he buy me a car?"
naw, how do y'all equate your pain
would it all go away if i bought you a range?
i got one or two of those, nothin gon' change
for nothing else, you gotta live with yourself
try and lie on hov' 'cause i ride on the road
in what, most would describe as a rolls
no, that's that continental t
the only car that fit intercontinental me, not guilty


y'all, cats, can't touch me
you can't touch me, no you can't touch me
