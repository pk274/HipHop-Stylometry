uhh...
uhh, yeah
won't stop niggas
"somehow the rap game remind me of the crack game"
jigga! feel me!
pa-pause, told ya motherfuckers, told ya
"see that rap shit is really just like sellin smoke"
uhh, roc-a-fella
geyeah


we treat this rap shit just like, handlin' weight
what they want we give it to 'em, what they abandon we take
hit a rapper with consignment, let him know it's at stake
put his ass in the studio, let him cook up a cake
when it's hot, get on my money spot in every state
like the wiz and camelot, the mom-and-pop's is the gate
but first we scope shit, advertise in every area
let the fiends know hey, we got some dope shit
gon' need a middle man, so we look to radio
let 'em test the product, give 'em a promo show
just a breeze, not enough to catch a real vibe
then we drop a maxi single and charge 'em two for five
ain't tryin' to, kill 'em at first just, buildin' clientele
so when the album drops the first weeks it's on sale
but when demand grows it's time to expand yo
you don't want no garbage papi, it's ten grand per blow, fo' sho'

ge-ge-geyeah
i got that uncut raw to make a fiend's body jerk
got your whole block now, pumpin' my work
my cd's is like keys for you willie's who
like to floss my cassette tapes in sixty-two's
and my singles like gems, you know the treys
get you high for a while, but the, high don't stay
you need another fix, you better cop these last two bricks
'cause when this shit flip, i'ma get on some other shit
never pitchin' for a label, jigga's the hook-up
you know my shit is fishscale, y'all niggas is cook up
just blow up, scream my name from brooklyn to da-kota
they know my shit stretch without the bakin' soda
went from an eighth, to a quarter, to a half a key
priority's work wasn't right so i switched factories
now i'm the new nigga, who figured i'd get the game locked
now watch how the prices of your cocaine drop, papa
