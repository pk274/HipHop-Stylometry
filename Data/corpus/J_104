you're now tuned into the greatest
motherfuckers can't beat us, join us, can't fade us, hate us
can't touch it, fuck it, can't see 'em, try to be 'em
both shows sold out your coliseum, 8th wonder
locked rap for trey summers, poker faces with the aces under
phase one of the takeover, the break's over
nigga, i'm the god mc, me, jay-hova
shit knockin', almost a crime, get cochran
bangin' to the hearse where my doctors hand
hot land, fbi, dea, i did crime, got away
they wanna see me pay, motherfuckers better ride
if they try to plant, under the seat of my car
even a half a gram, better flame those, plainclothes
same goes for lame hoes, cocaine rapper
rep ya game pros


yeah
there you have it
this thing of ours as can't be touched, tested, whatever
never disrespect this thing of ours
