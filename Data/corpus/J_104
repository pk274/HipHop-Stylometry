gotta reach the top (you gotta persevere)
can't wait another year
i gotta reach the top (yo jay, your time's near)
i gotta reach the top; fuck that, my time is here
yeah!


i came up far so brothers can know my name
i paid so many dues now i'm looking for change
too many years wasted
too many years on the set seeing the flavors, but i never did taste it
i gotta reach the top before i'm done with it
so much hard work now its time to have some fun with it
i got my eyes on the number one nigga
watch your spot on the charts, "here i come nigga!"
you hear the footsteps, you hear the sound
the only way i got to go is up the only way you got to go is down
now relax on your laurels i ain't faking jack
so with your $8.99 plus tax spent on my wax
your freud, paranoid
brothers afraid to be unemployed because jay-zs' ready to play with the big boys
i gots to get it, 'til then i won't stop
too many years rock bottom, i gotta reach the top




i gots to give them lots of rhythm
when all hell breaks loose i'm performing exorcisms
lurking in the shadows
ready to put work in
a hurting on competitions is curtains
i scheme like a coke fiend
keep brothers awake like codeine
'cause when you sleep i dream deep, right?
brothers better sleep light
'cause i keep sight on number one, so go 'head, sleep tight
i put them out, conspire like i won the house
things are looking up, so brothers better be looking out
i'm closing the gap like heidi
my shits selling more than shay whitey
i'm coming for your spot nigga
ain't nothing calm about the things on my mind
shit, i leave here sunny 'cause i won every time
you had your time now it's my turn to rock
and let my cream rise




i just won't stop there
i gotta maintain the status quo of being the baddest bro
the world is watching
girls clocking my rhyming
i cracked the oyster took the pearl but can i keep it shining?
too much passes the flame
too much knowledge to ascertain
i made a mark but can i leave a lasting name?
well put this in your pipe and smoke it
as long as i'm breathing, i keep the world open
i skip to the lou so don't sip the soup
then get gassed 'cause then, damn, i gotta rip your crew
my format is all that so skip the small chat
if you're all that then reach for the stars nigga!
i recycle them bars, hot like stolen cars
claim peace if anything brothers is holding off
i got to have it till then i won't stop
so many years rock bottom i gotta reach
