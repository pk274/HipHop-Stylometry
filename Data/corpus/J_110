is it because, my game is stronger, name last longer?
on the brain, like a whole eighth of 'caine
chicks stop, mesmerize, rub up on they tatas
like push up bras, who you dealin' with ma? it's jigga
you know the rawest, ice is flawless, baby
nights is lawless, recite for ballers
and i fools y'all fake players every time
'cause you only hit chicks that you think is mine
you know how i paid his due, but i'm unfadeable
mommy screamin' "papi, can i skate with you?"
they wanna ride with me, stay fly with me
wanna help me get rid of my rivalries
wanna be the ebony to my ivory
but i'm straight though, thanks ma, i only chase dough
we can lay for tonight, but in the mornin'
i get shirley murdock, i hope your door slam lock, i'm gone
