oh, this must be the way the nigga pac felt when he made
me against the world, all eyez on me
y'all niggas got me feelin' like all eyes on me, me against the world
mmm, y'all got me on my shit
thought niggas would appreciate what i did to this game
being that i'm flesh of your flesh, blood of your blood
come from the same hood you come from
we share basically the same stories
thought niggas would appreciate what i came and did
since ninety-six, every year
something must be seriously wrong with the world
i know y'all ain't hating


(some people hate) don't tell me niggas is hating
(some people hate) uhh, nah, you know what i think?
(some people hate) i think...
(i think they've lost their minds) think y'all lost your mind
y'all got me on my shit


raw, rough and rugged, when addressing the mass public
my attitude is fuck it 'cause motherfuckers love it
got a chip on my shoulder the size of the golden nugget in vegas
and fuck being famous, i came to get the butters
i came from the gutter, my success in this game
is sort of like pro-jectic justice
a payment for brushes with police officers
a peace offering from the gods for the streets i was tossed in
til i'm deceased in a coffin
i'ma be a beast on these beats releasing early and often
please, your disdain for the brothers ain't gon change the numbers
it's the strengthening of chain among us
please we ain't afraid of none of ya's; who want it with us?
ain't nuttin changed since the ninety-six summer, c'mon


(some people hate) yeah
(some people hate) uh, uh, uh
(some people hate) yeah! you know what i think?
(i think they've lost their minds) they say success breeds envy


i guess it's just the penalty of leadership
i guess i'm what niggas wanna be and shit
or niggas just bored wanna be in shit
'fore they get to rappin', start believing it, think they ali and shit
i roll with the punches so i survive
i bob and weave, move my feet from side to side
i'm back, stronger than ever, surprise, surprise
they try to take me out the game but i's alive
it's like a old negro spiritual, but i mastered tobey
with a splash of monster kody, shoot faster than kobe, nigga
you bastards know me, the one and only
big homie from the roc, i think you pastors lonely
you need jesus in your life
it's either that or y'all gon' make me
put the double desert eagles in your life, nigga


(some people hate)
(i know nigga's ain't hating man, let me find out)
(some people hate) jealousy is a weak emotion, man
(some people kill their brothers)
c'mon man, be stronger than that.. you know what i think?
(i think they've lost their minds) you'll be alright though


au contraire, nigga, i am here 'cause i earned this shit
by riding out when niggas had learners' permit
we bring then knives out or we let them burners spit
i bring them pies out if niggas wanna burn the strip
bring your rides out, bring your buggy eyes out
turn your six, i laid back in the maybach
nigga this the payback, i know you bitch niggas from way back
niggas wanna clown, but the pound, it don't play that
get yourself found drowned where the lake at
run up on 'em notoriously, take that, take that
and then we coming where your wake at
eight maniac cats strapped with gats, you can hate that
face facts, fake rap cats
can't take back what i took back to the brook, look
