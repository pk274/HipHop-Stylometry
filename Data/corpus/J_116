now let me count it off, now let me count it off
now let me count it off, now let me count it off
hey you, blow your whistle, now let me count it off
now let me count it off, now let me count it off
(uh, come on with it, get down with it)
hey you, blow your whistle, now let me count it off
now let me count it off, now let me count it off
(uh, come on with it, get down with it)
hey you, blow your whistle, now let me count it off

yeah, it’s young vito, voice of the young people
roc c-e-o, hot piss for the p-o
i’m so trill, the wood pandlin’, handlin’ meals
twenty inch jumpers from standin’ on my wheels
they can’t understand it, god damnit, he’s ill
everytime i drive, gotta prescribe ‘em for panic pills
i’m gigantic, the titanic would never sink
even with the band playin’, before that happend, that man sprayin’ (buck!)
ar fifteens, glocks and tecs
ak’s will pop, i bring ya all out the closet, girls
niggas is homos really, but when they smokin’ on purple
they get loco, but you know i know the drilly
it’s for these positions, that's why i keep the biscuits
you ain’t tony sopranno, you pussy, sleep with the fishes
you know i’m reppin’ from that 7-1-8
shots to you f-in’ son, class over, lesson’s done
hov’!
