verse 1: memphis bleek

as long as you and i keep it movin like a drive-by
we could stack dough sky-high
niggas can't touch what they can't feel, real recognize real

as long as you and i keep it movin like a drive-by
we could stack dough sky-high
niggas can't touch what they can't feel, real recognize real
