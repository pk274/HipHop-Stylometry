yeah, uh-huh, what the fuck
too ass quick for bastards to step to
leave wounds too drastic for rescue
when i rock jewels, it ain't to impress you
what the fuck niggas commentin on my shit fo'
i'm real - how you think i got rich, ho?
pack steel - ain't afraid to let a clip go
i got enough paper to get low
come back when the shit blow over get the dough over
huh whip the rover snatch the gat from the clip holder
rip through ya shoulder bitch it's jay-hovah
i'm too right wit it, too tight wit it
you light witted but if you're feel ya nice nigga spit it
who am i? jay-z, motherfucker, do or die
in brownsville, motherfucker
blocka, rocka, m.o.p collabo
front on us and gats blow ya know?
