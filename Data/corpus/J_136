give my ladies dick, my young hoes pee-pee
hits in a row like mj ("hee-hee!")
since i was waist height, late night, bustin' in the clouds
running wild, coming home late, cussin' out my mouth
niggas said, "bryan, leave your cousin in the house
every time we play the dozen, he's bugging out"
while y'all was playing yo-yo, i was sitting on low pros
dippin' the po-po, gettin' that dough-dough
no, no, i ain't stupid—i take loot, kid
what's in the bank? shoot it, lose it like i ain't do it
you wanna play jigga, nigga? what you drank, fluid?
got a full tank, now you wanna pull rank?
i clap steel, act ill, jigga shoot thee
give you chest pains, leg sprains—absolutely! what!

try to play hard get you found 'round the dirt
six shell casings found 'round your shirt
(*crying*) in surround sound from the hearse

kidnap grown folks, get them grands up
timbaland, hot shit—get them hands up
