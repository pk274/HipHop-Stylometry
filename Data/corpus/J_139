“i work and work 'til i'm half-dead and i hear people saying
"she's getting old," and what do i get? a daughter
who cares as much about the beautiful dresses i give her
as she cares about me!”


let's do this for these babies
mercedes truck, fuck, houses on acres
blatantly ballin' on hd
y'all need to step up y'all av
life changed again i was already taking off
my flight changed again
slight change of winds
it's barely 12 noon and my wife changed again
baby need pampers
daddy need at least three weeks in the hamptons
please don't judge me, only hugged the block
i thought my daddy didn't love me
my baby getting chubby
cue that stevie wonder music, aww, isn't she lovely?
now i'm staring at her praying that things don't get ugly
and i'm stuck in that old cycle like wife leaves hubby
fuck joint custody, i need a joint right now
just the thought alone fucks with me


high on life
i could die from the fall, imagine if i hit the floor
apologies in order to blue ivy my daughter
if it was up to me, you would be with me, sort of like daddy dearest


"don't fuck with me fellas. this ain't my first time at the rodeo."


i dream filthy (my mom and pops)
mixed me with jamaican (rum and whiskey, what a set off)
and i know i'm not perfect baby
i done been through so much trauma, it gonna be hard to reverse it
with some doctors and some nurses maybe
teach me on how to treat a lady, open doors on the 'cedes
this relationship shit is complicated
all i know if we ain't speaking everyday, i fucking hate it
i don't wanna duplicate it
i seen my mom and pop drive each other mothafuckin' crazy
and i got that nigga blood in me
i got his ego and his temper, all is missing is the drugs in me


high on life
i could die from the fall, imagine if i hit the floor
apologies in order to blue ivy my daughter
if it was up to me, you would be with me, sort of like daddy dearest


"no... wire... hangers... ever!"


father never taught me how to be a father, treat a mother
i don't wanna have to just repeat another leave another
baby with no daddy want no momma drama
i just wanna take her back to a time when everything was calmer
out in paris on a terrace watching the eiffel tower
and a ferris wheel yet and still, nothing could prepare us
for the beauty that you be blue be
looking in your eyes is like a mirror, have to face my fears
cheer up, why can't you just be happy
without these back and forth thoughts, you too much like your daddy
badly i just wanna spent more time with him
sadly life wouldn't let me get around with him
now i got my own daughter, taught her how to take her first steps
cut the cord watch her take her first breath
and i'm trying and i'm lying if i said i wasn't scared
but in life and death if i ain't here


high on life
i could die from the fall, imagine if i hit the floor
apologies in order to blue ivy my daughter
if it was up to me, you would be with me, sort of like daddy dearest
