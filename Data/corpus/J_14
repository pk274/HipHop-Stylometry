uh huh yea, yeah
duro!
you gotta let it bump
uh, uh, uh like dat yeah
come on bring the chorus in


i’d do a bid, loose a rib, bust a cap, trust in that
run up to heaven doors, exchange my life for yours
leave a steak out the door, mi casa, su casa
just remember to turn the lights off in the hall
my brother from another pop, minus one shot
we nino and gee money, man, we all we got
from the stoop to the big dudes, stoppin' us from playin' hoops
and us getting mad, throwing rocks off the roof
straight thuggin' man, i thought we would never progress
but look at us now man, we're young execs
my nigga dame, my nigga biggs, my nigga ty
my nigga high, my nigga gotti
we embody all that’s right with the world
no matter how pretty she is, you never liking my girl
that's how we run, when you ain’t around
i'll spank ya son, keep him in line
if you should die, i’ll keep him like mine
god forbid, keep this in mind, my nigga


i know momma, your little baby
but these streets raised me crazy
product of my environment, nothing can save me
thanks for letting me bloom, for your wisdom, for your womb
for the roof over my head, for my shoes, for my bed
for the most important lesson in life was when you said
"strive for what you believe in, set goals and you can achieve them"
thanks for the days you kept me breathing
when my asthma was bad and my chest was wheezin'
thanks for the look of love just as i was leaving
on nights you thought that i wouldn't come back, that left you grieving
thanks for holdin' down the household when times was bad
as a man, i apologize for my dad
when the rent was due, you would hustle like a pimp would do
that wasn’t the life meant for you
you’re a queen, you deserve the cream, everything that gleamed
everything that shines, everything that’s mine


check it out, uh, uh
dear nephews, i’m writing' this with no pen or a pad
and i’m signing it, ya uncle, ya best friend, and ya dad
don't look back if you fall and you’re feeling bad
i’m right there from your cut to when you peelin' the scab
if it comes a time when you ain’t feelin' your real dad
put my face on his body don’t wait for nobody
don’t follow no nigga, that's ho shit man
stand on your own two, do your shit man
the world is yours, some girls are nice some girls are whores
don't listen to your crew, do what works for you
standing back from situations gives you the perfect view
you see the snakes in the grass and you wait on their ass
bite your tongue for no one and whatever is said
take it how they want, a closed mouth don't get fed
you know my number when it’s code red
if you're wrong, my nigga
you're my nephew, fuck it we get it on my lil nigga
