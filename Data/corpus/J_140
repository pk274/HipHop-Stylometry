yeah.. yeah..
from the crap tables down in a.c
back on the block, jay-z motherfucker from the, the, the roc
went solo on that ass but it's still the same
brooklyn be the place where i serve them thangs
b. my niggas was strugglin', to the 'burbs they came
and then we got to hustlin', murderin' thangs
i dipped in my stash, splurged on a chain
now i'm titanic, iceberg's the name
leave players on injured reserve, hurt the game
the best way to describe me in a word, insane
i dick down chicks all emerged in my fame
jigga been dope since slick rick's first chain
the god, send you back to the earth from which you came
i'm bakin' soda, water, fire, merged with 'caine
ladies don't know me said, "i heard he's vain."
well, guess what, mami? i heard the same
you heard the name


(jigga) what's my motherfuckin' name?
(jigga) and who i'm rollin' with huh?

niggas better get it right, bitches better get it right, who?
(jigga) what's my motherfuckin' name?
(jigga) and who i'm rollin' with huh?
(my niggas) uh-huh-uh-uhh-uhh-uhh
niggas better get it right, bitches better get it right


yeah, uhh, i got a
license to kill so i steer the gat
roc-a-fella, ruff ryders, niggas scared of that
got a new motto this year, "don't fuck with my ones"
knock on your door, three in the mornin'
"it's just us and the guns!"
see i scrambled with priests, hustle with nuns
i got the, mind capacity of a young butch cassidy
niggas get fly, let 'em defy gravity
fo'-five rapidly, lift your chest cavity
streets won't let me chill
always been a clumsy nigga, don't let me spill
muh'fuckers wanna wet me still, i remain y'all
raw the one, like five divided by four
shit, this just the hate that's been provided by y'all
reciprocated and multiplied by more
you likely to see jigga in a widebody or
drop-top bentley azure, holla at me y'all, uhh


(jigga) what's my motherfuckin' name?
(jigga) and who i'm rollin' with huh?

(jigga) what's my motherfuckin' name?
(jigga) and who i'm rollin' with huh?

i don't give a fuck if i sold one or one million, but i think you should
'cause if i only sold one, then out comes the hood
all black in the club, the outcome ain't good
them niggas act like wolves, how come? they could
'cause we don't drop hits, we drop bombs that smash
'til the wrists is lit up, the arm looks like glass
the necklace chipped up, the charm it flash
could fuck up your eyes like the bombest hash
see the reason why chicks let me palm they ass
all i gotta do is let 'em call me shawn they glad
let me sit up in the whip 'til i launch it back
snap they neck, then shoot 'em 'til they arch them back
the calmest cat, trust me when i palm this gat
kill your mind, body and soul, push your conscience back
monster's back, and flex drop a bomb to that
and e'rybody sing-a-long to the track, c'mon
uh-huh uhh uhh
