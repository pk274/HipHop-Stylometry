catch a charge, i might
beat the box up like mike in '97, i bite
i'm ike turner, turn up, baby, no, i don't play
"now eat the cake, anna mae"
said, "eat the cake, anna mae," i'm nice
for y'all to reach these heights

we sex again in the mornin'
your breasteses is my breakfast, we goin' in


we be all night
love, love
we be all night
love, love
