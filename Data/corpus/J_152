allow me to re-introduce myself
my name is hov (oh), h to the o-v
i used to move snowflakes by the o-z (woo)
i guess even back then you can call me
you can call me, you can, you can call me


fresh out the fryin' pan into the fire
i be the music biz' number one supplier
flyer than a piece of paper bearin' my name
got the hottest chick in the game wearin' my chain
that's right, hov
