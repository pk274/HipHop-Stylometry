uh-huh, yeah (uh)
c'mon, uh-huh, such a deep flow (grrr…)
c'mon, yeah, c'mon, yo, yo


j-a-y, i flow sick (uh)
fuck all y'all haters, blow dick
i spits the game for those that throw bricks
money, cash, hoes, money, cash, chicks (what?)
sex, murder and mayhem; romance for the street (uh-huh)
only wife of mines is a life of crime, and since
life's a bitch in mini-skirts and big chest
how can i not flirt with death?
that's life's enigma, long as life within us
we gon' sin a lot and pray that christ forgive us, fuck it
ice the wrist and raise the price on these niggas
y'all can't floss on my level
i'll invite you all to get with us if your ball is glitter
when i go, on the hall of players, wall my picture (uh-huh)
if you get close enough, you can read the scripture
it reads: "money, cash, hoes", how real was that nigga? (what)


money, cash, hoes, money, cash, hoes (what)
money, cash, hoes, money, cash, hoes (uh)
money, cash, hoes, money, cash, hoes (c'mon)
money, cash, hoes, (what) hoes, (what) hoes (what)
money, cash, hoes, money, cash, hoes (what)
money, cash, hoes, money, cash, hoes (uh)
money, cash, hoes, money, cash, hoes (c'mon)
money, cash, hoes, (what) hoes, (what) hoes (what)


flavors robust, platinum and gold touch
yeah i rap now, fast money done slowed up
niggas try to stop jay-z to no luck
roc-a-fella forever, ceo, what! (what?)
us the villains? fuck your feelings
while y'all playa hate we in the upper millions
what's the dealings? (huh) it's like new york's been soft
ever since snoop came through and crushed the buildings
i'm trying to restore the feelings; fuck the law, keep dealing
more money, more cash, more chilling
i know they gon' criticize the hook on this song
like i give a fuck...i'm just a crook on this song
bed-stuy brook-nam took on the world
shit, i led a life you can write a book on
sex, murder and mayhem, romance for the street
man, and i tell ya, it'll be the best-seller, what!


money, cash, hoes, money, cash, hoes (what)
money, cash, hoes, money, cash, hoes (uh)
