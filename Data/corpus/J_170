know i do that
hell yeah, let's start from the top
need to just kill that shit
you go first though, huh
go back!


hey y'all, i used to wreck off, bust the tec off
pop the cork off moÃ«t off y'all, 3 quarters of the way
now that's history, pop cristy 'til i'm pissy
jigga, who is he? how bad y'all wanna know?
stick my head out the v-twizzy, get busy
bust lead out, let the world feel the misery
goin' loco, elude po-po
prelude to a champion, competition
not for nothin', can't be none
limited edition, like the lex with coach leather
'cept my approach is better, now or never
however, y'all want it, the style forever
'til it's redundant, jigga!
me and my operation, run the new york night scene
with one eye closed like peter gatien
none of our foes have an idea, back in the days
to fool the feds used to run our clothes for years
how can you possibly stop me?
i'm approximately a million overhead, u.s. dollars
product take cream like juan valdez
we's kodak, papa, see ya true co-lors
