ten toes, ten toes, we was out in that road, uh
lookin' for love in wrong places, we proposed to a stove, yeah
share jewels, share clothes, that's how deep this shit goes, yeah
every week, ya got bros, yeah, all of y'all fear closure
y'all switchin' sides like nba teams just after halftime
i'm pullin' up on my dog, make sure he okay, i don't even have time
then copped me a porsche with butterscotch seats, this 'fore they had mils
live better than rappers and they don't even have bills, it's that real
bought emory a bm as soon as he came home
we hopped on a plane, headed straight to the bay
that's how we turn the game on, it's game on
ty mama died, i was there, my nephew died, he was there
he in my house more than i be there, more than bey there
ty ty there, e there, breezy there, juan there
high here, chaka there, law there, they all here, ah yeah
dez there, kawanna here, shit feel like nirvana here
crib like the soho house, i might stay in and grow out my hair
tight circle, no squares, i'm geometrically opposed to you
y'all like to try angles, y'all like to troll, do you?
y'all talk around hoes, do you? y'all don't follow codes, do you?
we know everything you say from niggas close to you, you emotional
when i say, "free the dogs," i free 'em, that's how meek got his freedom
y'all put niggas on a t-shirt, it hurts you ain't never meet 'em
you got niggas in the feds, you ain't even tryna feed 'em
i'm tryna free the world, that's how deep i'm in
i ain't goin' to nobody nothin' if me and my wife beefin'
i don't care if the house on fire, i'm dyin', nigga, i ain't leavin'
ty-ty take care of my kids, after he done grievin'
if y'all don't understand that, we ain't meant to be friends
