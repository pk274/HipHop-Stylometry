back again and back again
i went from marcy to hollywood
and back again, and back again


as a youth i used to hold the weed up
old heads said i thought more like a soldier than a leader
in order to succeed i had to slow my speed up
didn't listen to stuff took another puff of the cheeba
they said believe us or not trust is something you earn
with every mistake you make back to us you return
probably would go hollywood i thought he was joking
my first taste of fame i hit the first thing smoking
all engulfed into honies, the pussy was tight
if she threw the pussy right, i got mushy like
damn baby i love you take all my cash
"you ain't got to lie jay," you already gettin' the ass
she loved that i was a thug it turned her on
soon as i got soft, it turned her off
i got relaxed put my feet up start dissing my friends
and that's when the ceiling fell in


i went from marcy to hollywood
and back again, and back again
i went from marcy to hollywood
and back again, and back again


i came through with the shines
like the streets was blind
didn't master my algebra, no caliber
stick me? i was thinking how and for what
but reality bites like a thousand mutts
nothing worse than the person that's foul with guts
to stick you quicker...


from marcy to hollywood
and back again, and back again
from marcy to hollywood
and back again, and back again


i went from marcy to hollywood
and back again, back again
from marcy to hollywood
and back again, back again
