sup ma? you want to roll with us, y'knowhati'msayin'?
it's good, it's love, it's all love
we got cases of belvedere, we gon' play truth or dare
we gon' really get to know one another
all you gotta do is put your hair down, get your mind right
knahmean? i'm here for you, yo


relax yourself, let your conscience be free
you now rollin' with them thugs from the r-o-c
ain't no place on the planet that you'd rather be
but in the blue flame, bitch you're new to the game
cross over to the roc, make yourself hot
the topic of discussion in every nail shop
it's a secret society, all we ask is trust
and within a week, watch your arm freeze up
brassiere get right, a to a d cup
weave get tight, pedicure your feet up
ears get iced, gear get spiced
from hoodrat to superstar, there's your life
fuck with hova, he can take you out of your hell
say bye to reebok, say hi to chanel
say hi to gucci, prada as well
take a look in the mirror, be proud of yourself
