if you ain't in it for the money then get out the game
motherfuckas' better think 'fore they spit out my name
i've been known to have tone, shit out the frame
load up the clip and aim, listen
if you ain't in it for the dough your rhymin' the blah
i hit you with an o you'll be the crime in your block
if you wanna sell a million motherfucker then ride
you know we come through with the glacier
we'll be blindin' your block
and our homes be spacious like a million and dot
i be holdin your bracelets tryin' to steal at your shot
been a villian since i can remember 4 wheelin' the plot
sell crack, make a million and stop, feel me?
