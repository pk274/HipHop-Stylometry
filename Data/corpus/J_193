they counted us out
they didn't think that we would make it, oh
they didn't believe in us (it breaks my heart), oh


but i know god did (where we at gu?), god did (oh, yes, he did, where we at gu?)
oh, god did (oh-oh)
oh, yes, god did (oh-oh)
oh, god did
but i know god did


hov did
please, lord forgive me for what the stove did
nobody touched the billi' until hov did
how many billionaires can come from hov crib? huh
i count three, me, ye and rih
bron's a roc boy, so four, technically (woo)
i left the dope game with my record clean, huh
i turned the cocaína into champagne, huh
i cleaned up la madrina with the same soap, huh
me and loro talk 'bout how we slang dope, huh
now the weed in stores, can you believe this, ty?
i put my hustle onto forbes, can you believe this guy?
then we said, "fuck it," took the dope public
out the mud, they gotta face you now, you can't make up this shit
judge it how you judge it, say we goin' corporate
nah, we just corner boys with the corner office
i'm at the cap table, what the splits is?
not that cap table, boy, we live this
breezy what the business is
we pushin' fenty like fentanyl, the shit is all legitimate (woo)
e was down ten for this
we just got his ten back then went back like, "where the interests is?"
em light up the o3
we let y'all do the zazas, og for the ogs
some new niggas out of pocket, talkin' exotic
you barely been to the baham— (haha) that's another topic
monogram in my pocket off the red carpet
you see the face i made that night, shit is that shockin'
odds wasn't great, we'd even be alive
gotta be crazy to y'all niggas, we surprised
shit is too much how we grew up (grew up)
shit don't even feel real to us (damn)
og sold to those, you called kingpin
if those your drug lords, then who are we then?
hov is a real nigga's dream
my only goal, to make a real nigga feel seen
sometimes, it make a fake nigga hate life
never my intention, the consequences of my way of life
the way we used to play with life
i'm now careful with the sentences, them only jail bars i like (woo)
i never wanted to be the state custodian (come on)
the laws are draconian (come on, hov)
for those married to the life (come on), it's holy matrimony and (come on)
somehow, i'll out-fox every box they'll try to throw me in (come on)
with great ceremony and
folk and 'nem told me how highly caddy spoke of him
and bloke and 'nem from london, harrow road, weston inn
i be speakin' to the souls of men
those of them willin' to die for the existence that this cold world has chose for them
kickin' snow off a frozen timb (woo)
back and forth on this turnpike, really took a toll on 'em
lot of fallen soldiers on these roads of sin
for those who make the laws, i'ma always have smoke for them
i got lawyers like shooters
workin' pro bono for him as a favor 'cause i throw them ms
in memory of teelo
i pray none of your people die over jailphones again
all this pain from the outside, inspired all this growth within
so new planes gettin' broken in
highest elevation of the self
they done fucked around and gave the right niggas wealth
these ain't songs, these is hymns 'cause i'm him
it's the psalm 151, this new testament
the book of hov (the book of hov)
jesus turned water to wine, for hov, it just took a stove
you never know how this shit could go
me and biggs probably got too big if they ain't book that load (what's up hoffa?)
hindsight is 20/20
though he's gettin' plenty money, lookin' back now this shit is funny
i just got a million off a sync
without riskin' a million years tryna get it out the sink (woo)
hov did
they said they don't know me internationally, niggas on the road did
i see a lot of hov in giggs
me and meek could never beef, i freed that nigga from a whole bid
hov did (hov did)
next time we have a discussion who the g.o.a.t., you donkeys know this
forgive me, that's my passion talkin' (haha)
sometimes i feel like farrakhan (haha) talkin' to mike wallace (haha)
i think y'all should keep quiet
breaks my heart (haha)
god did


they wanted us down, ooh-woah (come on, man)
but look at us now, oh
they counted us out
they didn't think that we would make it, oh
they didn't believe in us, oh
