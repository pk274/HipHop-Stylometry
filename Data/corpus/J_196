as soon as i grab it, i eat it up like a savage
and no one don't have it, i get it together like a marriage
i see you know rappers, i'm on my ps and qs and carrots
y'all don't understand well goddamn, don't y'all know my status?
i'm flowin' the baddest, the baddest, i'm the baddest
no need to explain, my name the only thing that matters
when suckers who bite me, they find i'm a bit much to swallow
you're thinkin' it's hollow, the rhythm is rough and r-rugged to follow
it hit you like bam biggity bam bam biggity bam
the kid is a wizard, i'm definitely destined to make 8 digits
met up with g rap on the road to riches
as soon as i step up, when ever i'm in the ...nah
whatever i touch, whatever i touch you know i'm gonna injure
that nigga don't play, hey, that nigga'll slay
so wiggle away, hey, you gotta dig that nigga jay


i'm the greatest mc, i'm the greatest mc in the world
i'm the greatest mc, i'm the greatest mc in the world


i be thorough in every borough, my name be ringin'
with drug slingin' and doin' my thing but fuck that
boot-knockin' so lady be jockin', my money be flippin'
i see you peekin' when i'm freakin', nigga stop rippin'
i got the ideal skills for real
6 digits before i had a deal, son chill
who's that? with a tip of the melodramatic the crew's back
i  x2

niggas who don't do duckin', i will bu-buck and, fuck it i'm wild

i see you brought your little crew, and?
i'm still comin' with velocity, check it out
jidday idday whiddy ziddy, eh-heh!
and any you clowns fuckin' around
ain't none of you clowns stand your ground
with the crown prince of the underground
sounds like i'm ready to catch wreck now, the heat's on
sweat now, jay z's on, be gone to the next town
punks jump up to get beat down, check it out, check it out, check it out
ladies be comin'  x2
