uh, uh, uh like dat yeah
come on bring the chorus in


i’d do a bid, loose a rib, bust a cap, trust in that
run up to heaven doors, exchange my life for yours
leave a steak out the door, mi casa, su casa
just remember to turn the lights off in the hall
my brother from another pop, minus one shot
we nino and gee money, man, we all we got
from the stoop to the big dudes, stoppin' us from playin' hoops
and us getting mad, throwing rocks off the roof
straight thuggin' man, i thought we would never progress
but look at us now man, we're young execs
my nigga dame, my nigga biggs, my nigga ty
my nigga high, my nigga gotti
we embody all that’s right with the world
no matter how pretty she is, you never liking my girl
that's how we run, when you ain’t around
i'll spank ya son, keep him in line
if you should die, i’ll keep him like mine
god forbid, keep this in mind, my nigga


i know momma, your little baby
but these streets raised me crazy
product of my environment, nothing can save me
thanks for letting me bloom, for your wisdom, for your womb
for the roof over my head, for my shoes, for my bed
for the most important lesson in life was when you said
"strive for what you believe in, set goals and you can achieve them"
thanks for the days you kept me breathing
when my asthma was bad and my chest was wheezin'
thanks for the look of love just as i was leaving
on nights you thought that i wouldn't come back, that left you grieving
thanks for holdin' down the household when times was bad
as a man, i apologize for my dad
when the rent was due, you would hustle like a pimp would do
that wasn’t the life meant for you
you’re a queen, you deserve the cream, everything that gleamed
everything that shines, everything that’s mine


check it out, uh, uh
dear nephews, i’m writing' this with no pen or a pad
and i’m signing it, ya uncle, ya best friend, and ya dad
don't look back if you fall and you’re feeling bad
i’m right there from your cut to when you peelin' the scab
if it comes a time when you ain’t feelin' your real dad
put my face on his body don’t wait for nobody
don’t follow no nigga, that's ho shit man
stand on your own two, do your shit man
the world is yours, some girls are nice some girls are whores
don't listen to your crew, do what works for you
standing back from situations gives you the perfect view
you see the snakes in the grass and you wait on their ass
bite your tongue for no one and whatever is said
take it how they want, a closed mouth don't get fed
you know my number when it’s code red
if you're wrong, my nigga
you're my nephew, fuck it we get it on my lil nigga



i remove your roof nigga let the sun shine in
thirty-eight waist, enough to put one nine in
really a thirty-six without the gun i'm thin
but when the gat is tucked, i'm fat as fuck
ignorant bastard, i'm takin' it back to day one
no kids, but trust me i know how to raise a gun
for niggas that think i spend my days in the sun
well here's the shock of your life, the glock not the mic
homie i'm not into hype; trust me, i'm still street
you still fuckin' up then trust me i still creep
yeah i know the platinum chain be lookin' real sweet
but reach and i bury niggas sixty feet deep
s dot carter turn rappers into martyrs

god i work hard, please don't envy me
i paid the cost to be the boss to floss this hard
i can recall a year ago i almost lost this job
all y'all remember is the part about me parkin' the hard
what about all them days i was walkin' my dogs
barkin' at broads, but they never hollered back
and if they did all they said was, "where them dollars at?"
imagine, bein' skinny growin' up around brolic cats
the quiet assassin demeanor of them college cats
until i got a gat and loudly start poppin' back
round the way, niggas called me bobby boucher

i ain't crossover i brought the suburbs to the hood
made 'em relate to your struggle, told 'em 'bout your hustle
went on mtv with durags, i made them love you
you know normally them people wouldn't be fuckin' witchu
'til i made 'em understand why you do what you do
i expected to hear, "jay, if it wasn't for you.."
but instead, all i hear is buzzin' in your crew
how y'all schemin', tryin' to get accustomed to my moves
so y'all could tape my mouth, stake out my house
but i got pride i'm a nigga first
i gotta cock back and pull the trigger first
that's how jigga work
the funny thing; i represent y'all every time i spit a verse
and that's the shit that hurts
but hey, i got my mind right, got my nine right here
so when y'all feel that the time is right..

ayo yo, ayo yo
it's only fair that i warn ya, rap's my new hustle
i'm treatin' it like the corner, fuck with me if you wanna
my game change but my mind-frame remains the same
i gotta protect what's mine
shit i started from nothin'; zero, zip
i made my way hustlin', i don't owe niggas shit
i'm paranoid now, so i keep the gun gripped
cats i played skelly with? niggas done flipped
i keep a banger in the ankle, one in the hip
two in the stash, one come up when i shift
i keep one under the chair where i sit
i even got a gun in the hair in the bun of my bitch
ask biggs; every time he'd come to my crib
he'd find another gun that i hid
i'm ready to make this one of the, hottest summer there is
everyday like a hundred-and-six... shit...

(millennium flow)
serena altschul's here live outside the criminal courthouse
(this is {bullshit} y'all)
in new york city for the first day in the trial of
(i'm gone) {*car speeds off*}
the state vs. shawn carter, a.k.a. jay-z
(uhh, uh-huh-uh, uhh, uh-huh-uh, uhh)
whatever the verdict in this trial may be
the effects will undoubtedly be felt worldwide


ayo, stand forward, 'fore you take notice
or witness to me killin' the track
testify 'til me spillin' the smack
now they got me for traffickin', racketeerin', audio crack
they call me dope man, dope man
i try to tell 'em i'm where hope, floats man
ghetto spokes-man
a broke man, approachin' the bench with intent
to bury me under the cell, fingered me as the toast man
evidence stemmin' from ninety-six
they say the world ain't recovered from his fix
while they was usin' cut, i was on some other shit
gave it to you raw and they just discovered it
nowaday, the jury got they brow raised
listenin' to testimony about my foul ways
exhibit a: reasonable doubt
they say this was the first thing that turned the peoples out


they call me dope man, dope man
i try to tell 'em i'm where hope, floats man
ghetto spokes-man


how come, you label your brand of dope
vol. 1 and spread it through the slums?
fed it to the young with total disregard
your honor, the state seeks the maximum charge
and how could you, turn right around
and release a lethal dosage called vol. 2
and is true you operate the criminal enterprise
known as roc-a-fella in charge of his meteoric rise?
and do you deny you're responsible for the demise
of record execs, and do you object?
your distribution's polygram, and through your connects
def jam, you pushed over five million soundscan
and not to mention, your co-horts and henchmen
dame, biggs, lyor, kev' and russell simmons
and we ain't gon' talk about murder inc
that just establishes a darker deeper criminal link


they call me dope man, dope man
i try to tell 'em i'm where hope, floats man
ghetto spokes-man


they call me dope man, dope man
i try to tell em i'm where hope, floats man
ghetto spokes-man


right hand on the bible, left hand in the air
before i spoke one word, made sure my throat was clear
a-hem, i'm a prisoner of circumstance
frail nigga, i couldn't much work with my hands
but my mind was strong, i grew where you hold your blacks up
trap us, expect us not to pick gats up
where you drop your cracks off by the mack trucks
destroy our dreams of lawyers and actors
keep us spiralin', goin' backwards
at age nine, saw my first hate crime
blindfolded, expected to walk a straight line
mind molded, taught to love you and hate mine
climbed over it, at a early age, jay shined
fuck the system at lady justice i blaze nine
your honor, i no longer kill my people, i raise mine
the soul of mumia in this modern day time


they call me dope man, dope man
i try to tell 'em i'm where hope, floats man
ghetto spokes-man



jigga man, swizz beatz
history in the making, part three
lights out ladies!


c'mon here baby, you drive me crazy (where all my baby thugs?)

c'mon here baby, you drive me crazy (where all my baby thugs?)
don't want nobody but you my baby (and all my ladies sing)
hold me tight and call me your lady
make me scream your name


i took ya outta jacob's in clusters
busters they wanted to rush us
love the way you sparkle when the sun touch ya
when you blush you turn blue if your grade is right
you can light up the whole room, turning day from night
when the summertime is in and the tops are down
with you around my neck we lock the whole block down (that's right)
it took short sleeves and lounging to understand
the reason they call you ice, everybody freeze
ain't a pendant in the sun who can shine like you
and that platinum in the charm who can blind like you
the direct reason why niggas do they crimes they do
i used to snatch the necklace right off them reckless fools
guess i was jealous that they was so next to you
so i devoted half my time to invest in you
the other half was spent on protecting you
'cause you belong to me, now sing ya song for me
c'mon


c'mon here baby, you drive me crazy (where all my baby thugs?)
don't want nobody but you my baby (and all my ladies sing)
hold me tight and call me your lady (say it louder)
make me scream your name
c'mon here baby, you drive me crazy (where all my baby thugs?)
don't want nobody but you my baby (and all my ladies sing)
hold me tight and call me your lady
make me scream your name


i'm often with you, so they wonder 'bout the juice i got
i took you from the projects and an abusive pops
from the bottom to the top
the skateboard to the drop
from the nada to the prada
i got ya like i got ya
from the first time i put you round my neck and locked ya
it was then i knew everywhere i went you'd follow
soon i spent every dollar, you became my habit
other brothers vice was smoke, mines was carats
the more checks i got the more i laced my crew
the rocks got bigger, watch face got blue
tricked a little bit, shit i lace my boo
fuck it, my mistress i laced her too
cop my jewels twice, like déjà vu
if they ever met in the mall, it was over y'all
just the way i do, and either way you win
i mean the thugs love ya when you're girl's best friend


c'mon here baby, you drive me crazy (where all my baby thugs?)
don't want nobody but you my baby (and all my ladies sing)
hold me tight and call me your lady
make me scream your name (and all my ladies sing)
c'mon here baby, you drive me crazy (where all my baby thugs?)
don't want nobody but you my baby (and all my ladies sing)
hold me tight and call me your lady
make me scream your name


yeah, yeah, yeah
in the wedding band you love, in the gold chain you thug
sometimes you given just because
and the tennis bracelet means they want relations
know that they wanna fuck, the only reason they give you up
in the hands of gold diggers you never enough
rings, things, just never enough
but me and you together gon' shine to the end
i mean the thugs love ya, but ya girl's best friend


c'mon here baby, you drive me crazy
don't want nobody but you my baby
hold me tight and call me your lady
make me scream your name
c'mon here baby, you drive me crazy (where all my baby thugs?)
don't want nobody but you my baby (and all my ladies sing)
hold me tight and call me your lady
make me scream your name
c'mon here baby, you drive me crazy
don't want nobody but you my baby
hold me tight and call me your lady
make me scream your name

let me sit up in the whip 'til i launch it back
snap they neck, then shoot 'em 'til they arch them back
the calmest cat, trust me when i palm this gat

geyeah, nymp the realest, uhh
this is educated thug mu-sic, niggas


life's a battle, mean streets eat you alive
blocks'll have you, tryin' to maintain your course
through the potholes and gravel
hot holes and what-have-you, tryin' to clock dough
foes tryin' to pop shots through you by code
pigs tryin' to grab you and lock up your soul
through the hot apple, nighttime shots crackle
(bucka bucka bucka) fiends tryin' to gaffle you
not only coke heads but the feds in the mercury topaz
after you, up the avenue
tryin' to give you big numbers, you got math to do
tryin' to make you miss summer, shit, that ain't cool
i caught smaller cases tryin' to get capital
up against the wall, tryin' to pass through
ghost-like, hear the cries from the tortured souls
most nights, i hold my toast tight, and it goes like


uhh, n.y.m.p., the realest niggas
n.y.m.p., the realest niggas
uhh, uh-huh-uh-uhh, n.y.m.p. the realest
marcy.. brooklyn..


yo, i come through, gettin' money, sittin' on twenties
niggas throwin' me shade, but ain't shit sunny
hot shells only thing niggas could get from me
cocktails thrown in your livin' room, ka-boom!
i'm so confrontational
they shoulda never let me go on probation yo
i'm a hustler, except that..
no correctional facilities can correct that
i took a step back, i viewed myself, seen where my head was at
it's where that dough is homie, gotta get that
gotta get away, some try but head back
uhh, street smart niggas got left back
some died, they left stacks
me, i ball right, and on top of that i'm dog nice
jigga been cold as fuck before ice
not before christ, but a long fuckin' time
get your mind right niggas

uh-huh-uh-uhh, n.y.m.p., the realest niggas
uhh uh-huh, uh-uhh, n.y.m.p. the realest niggas
marcy.. feel me..


i looked death in the face years back
i held tears back, i gathered myself and stared back
i'm from where you don't crack, the weak don't live
you gotta bounce back homie, the streets don't give
i take and rape villages, who gon' stop him?
not rudy giuliani, not hillary rodham
still i still pop him
shit, i grassy knoll and hilltop him, it's all political now
i think big when i spit at you now
between my dog and the figures, the four gonna get'cha
between life and death, they killed my spirit
so what little life i got left, y'all can expect me to ball
i empowered myself, teacher said i was a lost cause
'cause i used to roam them halls
still i spit knowledge, dropped out of high school, skipped college
who woulda thought i'd make it "big" like ms. wallace?


uhh, yeah, n.y.m.p., the realest niggas
brooklyn, what? uhh, n.y.m.p., the realest niggas
uhh, uh-huh-uh-uhh, n.y.m.p. the realest niggas

career crook; nobody rep brooklyn like me
jiggaman, volume 3: i'm back lookin' like me
stop the presses; baby girls, drop your dresses
b-k, lick a shot for big pop' in heaven
ever since i came through, niggas got the impression
everything i drop, out of the question
stop the guessing—it's hot
flows proving; i pack 'cause my dough's moving
my whole crew up in this muh'fucker
we spray corners; stand there like you got a cape on you
fine—you'll be wearing a black suit a long time
i put your crew in hard-bottom
the priest is like, "god's got him
he never did nothing to nobody, but them boys shot him"
brandish iron, outlandish buying
bentley coupes—not bragging, just simply the truth
we all from the ghetto; only difference, we go back
back up in d&d on this primo track—listen


i'm so gangsta, prissy chicks don't wanna fuck with me
"iceberg slim, baby, ride rims"
i'm so gutter, ghetto girls fall in love with me
"you know him well"
"by the name of jigga"
i'm so gangsta, prissy chicks don't wanna fuck with me
"you can love me or hate me"
"jay-z"
i'm so gutter, ghetto girls fall in love with me
"roc-a-fella"
"lock the whole block down" (ugh)


wednesdays, i'm up in shine; cheetah's, monday night
i'm fucking with the model chicks friday night at life
so i'm cruisin' in the car with this bougie broad
she said, "jiggaman, you rich, take the do-rag off"
hit a u-turn: "ma, i'm dropping you back off"
front of the club: "jigga, why you do that for?"
thug nigga 'til the end—tell a friend, bitch
won't change for no paper, plus i been rich
eighty-eight, been hustling; linen, been crushing 'em
women, been fucking 'em—huh?
you see, i live for the love of the street
rap to the ruggedest beats, hall closet cluttered with heat
i spit that murder-murder-murder, that brook-brook-a-brooklyn shit
furthermore, ma—
we tote guns to the grammys, pop bottles on the white house lawn
guess i'm just the same old shawn


i'm so gangsta, prissy chicks don't wanna fuck with me
"iceberg slim, baby, ride rims"
i'm so gutter, ghetto girls fall in love with me

i'm so gangsta, prissy chicks don't wanna fuck with me
"you can love me or hate me"
"jay-z"
i'm so gutter, ghetto girls fall in love with me
"roc-a-fella"
"lock the whole block down" (check it out now)


i'm from the m-to-the-a-, baby, -r-c-y
so it's hard for me to let the larceny die
niggas see me in the streets with no bodyguards
just two big guns that'll body your squad
'cause niggas be schemin' on me—probably y'all
think jigga's a joke, nigga? hardy-har
i spit brook-brook-brooklyn every time i bust
radio's gotta play me, though i cuss too much
magazines said i'm shallow—i never learned to swim
still, they put me on they cover 'cause i earn for them
soon as i sell too much, watch them turn on him
'cause that seem to be the shit that'll earn for them
i spit that murder-murder-murderous every time
a verbalist iller than verbal kint is, or o-dog in menace
i'm ill, start-to-finish, i rip apart contenders—i'm hot!
hahahaha


i'm so gangsta, prissy chicks don't wanna fuck with me

jigga, yeah, primo, yeah
gangsta, yeah, niggas, yeah
brooklyn, yeah

i hustle from, night to morning, dawn to dusk
kidnap and robberies like, (c'mon nigga) "you goin' with us"
i held roundtable meetings so we could go on and discuss
not only money but all the emotions goin' through us
why we don't cry when niggas die, that's how the street raised him
look in the air, say a prayer (hail mary), hopin' god forgave him
cop liquor, twist it, tap it twice, pour it to the pavement
we live dangerous, often findin' ourself in the eyes of strangers
(who the fuck is you?) my dream is big and in it my team is rich
as seen through the eyes of a nigga who ain't seen shit
back to live action, i'm packin', i'm still in the mix
like new hits, i think i'm goin' over your head a lil' bit
but i let you know i changed names when i roam through town
stay free and be who i'm professional known as now
jay-motherfuckin'-z; and with that said
back to shawn carter the hustler, jay-z is dead, and i ahh


my infatuation with autos led to autos gettin' sprayed
houses gettin' broken in, quarters gettin' trayed
bricks gettin' chopped, mom's pots gettin' used
one thrown in that water, try the soda if there's two (bring it back)
expensive shoes worn, louis vuitton seats, roof gone
coke cheap, my face is like a coupon
i gotta do shawn, 'cause even when jay-z was lukewarm
i was gettin' my loot on, nigga i'm too strong
eat 'til the food's gone, they placed me on this earth
the twin brother of rich porter, separated at birth
i got the soul of a hustler, quiet noise like a muffler
fuck with us, walk through the ghetto
see the place that corrupted us
learn why we buck at the guys that come up with us
ain't enough bucks for us to split in this shit
plus ain't nobody lovin' us; and with that said
back to shawn carter the hustler, jay-z is dead, and i ahh


see my life is like a see-saw
and until i move this weight it's gon' keep me to the floor
travel with me through my deep thoughts
y'all can't learn jigga by the shit y'all be readin' in the source
it's deeper of course
follow the life of this reckless minor
at sixteen in the 600, unlicensed driver
playin', cops and robbers, like shots can't stop us
flippin' a bird to the choppers (fuck you coppers!)
buck-thirty on the turns
reckless abandon, when i'm standin' on this pedal
hand on my metal, mind is on this time they tryin' to give me
lord help me, all i ever wanted to be was wealthy or
somebody to tell me that they felt me
i tried to play the hand you dealt me
but you gave me five funnies an' shit
i was hungry i needed menage money
nothin' less than a 520; and with that said
back to shawn carter the hustler, jay-z is {*gunshot*}



uh-huh, uh

crazed and demonic, uh, without blazin' chronic
product of reaganomics
you know that motherfuckin' stoop raised me
ringin' in the hoops but i was too lazy
school made me sick, teachers said i was too crazy
low and behold, it's the new and improved jay-z
let me explain this to you, baby
i spent nights out, days in
niggas was blazing
twelve noon where i was raised in
i felt caged in but kept roaming
prayed for the day of atonement
married to the streets no date of annulment
it seems every time it comes up, they postpone it
so i kept my chrome at the waist, waiting for the omen
savoring the moment and now you know
the reason that i flow the way i flow, baby


it's the things that you do
that make me feel so
(come on, inhale, exhale, breathe on it for me)

that's how i make you bounce like that
defy webster's words they can't pronounce like that
that's why no other rapper got a sound like that
trap, trap of my life
flashback, kill niggas
rap skills unmatched, jigga man baby
i can't entertain it sometimes i can't explain it
god given, guess it was all for hard living
far be it from me to question allah's wisdom
could've been lost in the system
instead i'm involved with the rhythm
i dodged prison, came out unscathed from car collisions
i know i must be part of some mission
shit, i used take it for granted
why they placed me on this planet
i would ask myself while writin' raps to myself
but right there under my nose
was the flow of all flows
not a demon but a rose in the cement, come on


it's the things that you do
that make me feel so
(come on, inhale, exhale, breathe on it for me)
and i don't know the way i feel
i can't explain
(uh)
i love you
you thug you, look what you make the clubs do
(bounce, bounce)
it's the things that you do
that make me feel so
(exhale breathe on it for me)
and i don't know the way i feel
i can't explain (yeah)
i love you
(uh come on)
you thug you, look what you make the clubs do


you know i've traveled through zones
homes spazzed like a bad back
i came into this game on jaz's back
i jumped off stood on my own two like boom, that's that
yeah i'm here to show and prove
don't matter to me the garden or flowin' on clue
whatever niggas wanna do - it's alright with me
whether you big or bossy, jig or flossy
dusty or musty, sober or saucy
broker than todd bridges, richer than bill cosby
forgive me for my arrogance or you still salty?
past on to the next life and you still haunt me
i'ma keep doing me unfortunately
i make the club rock, make thugs pop guns
make old folks do the bus stop; can't stop son
shit i give you what's hot and what's not, i never knew
y'all (niggas) know (niggas) how (niggas) do


it's the things that you do that make me feel so
(uh, exhale, inhale)
and i don't know the way i feel
i can explain
i love you
you thug you, look what you make the clubs do
(uh, bounce, shake, what? uh-huh)
it's the things that you do that make me feel so

halfway out of my mind music on 9, blasting donny hathaway
me and my niggas spending half the day
plotting, how we gon' get this math today without getting blast away
i wake up to the same problems after today
life is harsh, nigga got a right to spark
right from the start, they place me in the ghetto, tender age of nine
my tender mind had to surrender to crime
wouldn't wish this on nobody life to end up like mine
ever since i was quite young a nigga been in a bind
had to scratch for every plaque, even rap ain't all it's cracked up to be
niggas don't stack up to me
had to hustle in a world of trouble
trapped in, claustrophobic, the only way out was rapping
america don't understand it, the demographics i tapped in
i'm the truest nigga to do this, nigga, and anything else is foolish
like those who stay high, under god's grey skies
my lyrics is like bible, made to save lives
in the midst of all your misery nigga, stay fly
never let em see you frown, even smile when you down
shit, i floss on my off-days, fuck what they all say
niggas can't stop me with rumors, i'm too strong
all day, socks explode and sweatpants pockets is bulging
holdin' it down on the corner with my block frozen
my spot is rolling, drop the price on the coke and
drove the competition out and let the dough flow in
the cops is closing in, i can do the time
but what's really on my mind, there ain't no hoes in the pen
i play the low and try and make it hard to find me
feds still tryna build a case since '93
i told them i'm retired, but they like whatever
you know them pigs don't wanna see you get your life together


i'm stuck in this life forever
the more things change the more they stay the same
who am i to change the game?
you gotta move quick like heroin and cocaine
the block's hotter than its ever been
(once again)


hold the gun at eye level, i ain't afraid of conflict
i let the nine rip, nigga say "hi" to the devil
i blind with the bezel, i'm in line with the ghetto
what y'all niggas afraid of, my mind or the metal?
niggas tryna subtract my life, my mathematics is precise
i carry the 9, so fucking with me just ain't the answer
i just can't lose when i was young i was like fresh
poppa raised me to chess moves
and though you're gone, i'm not bitter, you left me prepared
we got divided by the years, but i got it from here
don't sweat that, sounds bump from marcy to lefrak
to that project in dc where my man caught his death at
over my years i've seen rooks get tooken by the knight
lose they crown by tryna defend a queen
checkmate in 4 moves, the bobby fischer of rap with raw moves
in a time where we all move
let's face it: either you're dough chasing or basing
lacing, crack's got you feelin' strong like mason
careful, any infiltration, i'm leaving niggas
leaking more than just information


i'm stuck in this life forever
the more things change the more they stay the same
who am i to change the game?
you gotta move quick like heroin and cocaine
the block's hotter than its ever been
i'm stuck in this life forever
the more things change the more they stay the same
who am i to change the game?
you gotta move quick like heroin and cocaine
the block's hotter than its ever been

get a grip bitch, this how i get through life
i buy out the bar, spit cris' through the mic
