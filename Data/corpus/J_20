back when nobody would find he had talent, nobody would sign me
nobody believed in me, nobody but mommy, blindly
but how can she deny me? me being the youngest runt
to come up outta her tummy, she got nothing but love for me
when niggas would one me, the industry shunned me
that's why i'm taking all the industry's money
revenge is sweet honey, we run this
young is the illest, free is the future
beans and bleek is right now, we can see y'all, eight miles, nigga
