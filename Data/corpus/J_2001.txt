once you memorize a sentence, it's like an exercise
y'all niggas can't be serious right now

i'm leading the league in at least six statistical categories right now
best flow, most consistent, realest stories
most charisma
i set the most trends
and my interviews are hotter
holla


i jog in the graveyard, spar in the same ring
that was housed by the building where malcolm x was slain
i spring train in the winter, 'round early december
run suicide drills over and over
with the weight of the world on my shoulder
that's why they call me hova
i'm far from being god, but i work goddamn hard
i wake up the birds, so when the nerds asleep
i'm catching my second wind the second the first one ends
i am focused, man, and i'm not afraid of death
i'm going all out, i circle the vultures in a van and
i run the block (run), pull up in a drop (pull up)
push up on my money (push up), i'm in great shape, dunny (woo)
i keep jacks jumping, thirty-six sets
like a personal trainer, i teach coke to stretch
i pump in roc sweats, all-white trainers
the ghetto's billy blanks, i show you niggas what pain is
maintain your stamina, hov will damage ya
spot you two rhymes, y'all niggas is amateurs
the fifth a deadlift
if niggas don't wanna get shot, then y'all niggas better squat
i drop your set for rep
no need to hit the showers, the spit from the fifth leave you wet
lyrical exercise
y'all niggas ain't tired, right?


one, one, two, two, three, three, four
breathe easy
one, one, two, two, three, three, four
breathe easy
one, one, two, two, three, three, four
breathe easy
one, two, three, four

we don't struggle with undeveloped muscles
y'all ain't real, that's y'all achilles' heel
same routine when you see me, you know the drill
i spot ya
i lift the weight of the watch off your arm, remain nice and calm
put down your things
trinidad of the game, know my way around your ring
no matter how many pounds you bring

r-o-c is the strongest team, fuckers

i'm not a one girl's guy (real talk for you, peep game)
and they know it
when it comes to love, i don't lie (we don't lie, man)
and the girls respect me for it (you gotta respect that)
ain't gonna say my nose can't be opened (i mean, never say never)
but right now, it's just too many fine ladies out there (too many ladies, hah)
to choose one from

i love girls, girls, girls, girls, girls, i do adore
yo, put your number on this paper, 'cause i would love to date ya
holla at ya when i come off tour (woo)


who you lovin'? who you wanna be huggin', huh?
who you with? who you wanna be fuckin'?
got this smarty art chick to whom i pose this question
i read a couple books to add to her soul's progression
to put this in laymen's terms, i gave her some knowledge
she gave me brains in return, she had to drop out of college
now all she does is homework, i give her in-house tutorin'
in and out, i'm movin' through her student body union
and she call me professor, say daddy come and test her
so she could fail on purpose and repeat the semester
i'm like, "at this rate, ma, you'll never graduate"
she said, "i ain't no fool, i'll make it up in summer school"


i love girls, girls, girls, girls, girls, i do adore
yo, put your number on this paper, 'cause i would love to date ya
holla at ya when i come off tour

yo, put your number on this paper, 'cause i would love to date ya
holla at ya when i come off tour


huh? who you lovin'? who you wanna be fuckin'?
who said what? why you trippin', girl? why is you fussin'?
got this model-slash-actress-slash-part-time waitress
spend her whole day, she hanging 'round with part-time haters
all they do is dish dirt and put her up on my latest
itinerary, but since i tend to vary, see
i tend to carry more rumors than ten mariah careys
tend to hurries, in ten places at once (woo)
plus she can't front, 'cause peep how i run mines
ma, our time together is our time together, and uh
our time apart is our time apart
so love jay with your mind, girl, and not your heart
and some day, i'll slow down, but for now, i get around
like the late makaveli or pirelli twenty-inches
or caine and o-dog, stick up tape from menace
you tell 'em chicks if they must know my business


i'm tryin' girls out
just tryin' girls out
put your number on this paper, 'cause i would love to date ya
holla at ya when i get off tour
i'm tryin' girls, girls, girls, girls, girls, i do adore
yo, put your number on this paper, 'cause i would love to date ya
holla at ya when i come off tour


i'm lookin' for a southern girl that cook like patti labelle
big ghetto booty, scarf over her doobie
chanel under the louis, gucci over her booty
vicky cover her titties, attitude of the city
pretty, witty, girly, worldly
one who likes to party, but come home early
light, kinda dark, short, sorta tall
slim, kinda thick, i swear i love 'em all
she can cook the coke and got hook-up on the license
but she can get you first-class seats for coach prices
isn't this great? my flight leaves at eight
her flight lands at nine, my game just rewinds


i'm tryin' girls out
just tryin' girls out
put your number on this paper, 'cause i would love to date ya
holla at ya when i get off tour
i'm tryin' girls, girls, girls, girls, girls, i do adore
yo, put your number on this paper, 'cause i would love to date ya
holla at ya when i come off tour

so hopefully you won't have to go through that
i was raised in the projects, roaches and rats
smokers out back sellin' they mama's sofa
lookouts on the corner focused on the ave
ladies in the window focused on the kinfolk
me under a lamppost, why i got my hand closed?
crack's in my palm, watching the long arm of the law
so you know i seen it all before
i've seen hoop dreams deflate like a true fiend's weight
to try and to fail, the two things i hate
succeed and this rap game, the two things that's great
h to the izz-o, v to the izz-a
what else can i say about dude? i gets busy

h to the izz-o, v to the izz-a

where my dogs at? where my soldiers at war?
where your balls at? woah, gotta pause that (woah)
lost ninety-two bricks, had to fall back
knocked a nigga off his feet, but i crawled back
had a1 credit, got more crack
from the first to the fifth, gave it all back
if i'm not a hustler, what you call that?
this is before rap ('fore), this is all fact (fact), i never change


never, never, never, never change

i'm still fuckin' with crime, 'cause crime pays (i never change)
out hustlin', same clothes for days (i never change, c'mon)
i never change, i'm too stuck in my ways, i'll never change


'fore the streets robbed me, wasn't educated properly
well, fuck y'all, i needed money for atari
was so young, my big sis still playin' with barbie
young brother, big city, eight million stories
old heads taught me, "youngin, walk softly"
carry a big clip that'll get niggas off me
keep coke in coffee, keep money smellin' mothy
chains is cool to cop, but more important is lawyer fees (uh)
that's how it is now (uh), that's how it always be (uh)
i never change, this is always me
from the womb to the tomb, from now 'til my doom
drink army from one cup, pass it around the room (that's a family, nigga)
that's the ritual (yup), big ran, i ain't forget you, fool
and all that bullshit you tryin' to get through
this is crew love, move music or move drugs

this is jay every day
who you know like hov, nigga?

motherfuckers say that i'm foolish, i only talk about jewels (bling-bling)
do you fools listen to music or do you just skim through it?
see, i'm influenced by the ghetto you ruined
the same dude you gave nothin', i made somethin' doin'
what i do through and through and
i give you the news with a twist, it's just his ghetto point of view
the renegade, you been afraid i penetrate pop culture
bring 'em a lot closer to the block where they pop toasters
and they live with they moms, got dropped roadsters
from botched robberies, niggas crouched over
mami's knocked up 'cause she wasn't watched over
knocked down by some clown
when child support knocked, "no, he's not around"
now, how that sound to ya? jot it down
i bring you through the ghetto without ridin' 'round
hidin' down, duckin' strays from frustrated youths stuck in they ways
just read a magazine that fucked up my day
how you rate music that thugs with nothin' relate to it?
i help them see they way through it, not you
can't step in my pants, can't walk in my shoes
bet everything you worth, you'll lose your tie and your shirt

renegade, never been afraid to say
what's on my mind at any given time of day
'cause i'm a renegade
never been afraid to talk about anything
(anything?), anything (anything)
renegade, never been afraid to say
what's on my mind at any given time of day
'cause i'm a renegade
never been afraid to holler about anything
(anything?), anything (anything)


i had to hustle, my back to the wall, ashy knuckles
pockets filled with a lotta lint, not a cent
gotta vent, lotta innocent lives lost on the project bench
what you hollerin'? gotta pay rent, bring dollars in
by the bodega, iron under my coat, feelin' braver
durag wrappin' my waves up, pockets full of hope
do not step to me
i'm awkward, i box lefty
an orphan, my pops left me
and often my mama wasn't home
could not stress to me, i wasn't grown
'specially on nights i brought somethin' home to quiet the stomach rumblings
my demeanor thirty years my senior
my childhood didn't mean much, only raisin' green up
raisin' my fingers to critics, raisin' my head to the sky
big, i did it, multi before i die
no lie, just know i chose my own fate
i drove by the fork in the road and went straight


renegade, never been afraid to say
what's on my mind at any given time of day

nasty shit, you thought i was boning renette
you calling carm' a hundred times, i was boning her neck
you got a baby by the broad, you can't disown her yet
when does your lies end? when does the truth begin?
when does reality set in, or does it not matter?
gotta hurt: i'm your baby mama's favorite rapper (haha)

holla at a real nigga! jigga! (i don't give a fuck!)

you know what i mean?

turn my music high, high, high, higher
(you don't know what you're doin'â€” doin'â€” doin'â€”)
sure, i do


i'm from the streets where the hood could swallow 'em and
bullets'd follow 'em and
there's so much coke that you could run the slalom
and cops comb the shit top to bottom
and say that we are prone to violence, but it's home sweet home
where personalities clash and chrome meets chrome
the coke prices up and down like it's wall street, holmes
but this is worse than the dow jones, your brains are now blown
all over that brown brougham, one slip, you are now gone
welcome to hell, where you are welcome to sell
but when them shells come, you better return 'em
all scars, we earn 'em
all cars, we learn 'em like the back of our hand
we watch for cops hoppin' out the back of vans
wear a g on my chest, i don't need dapper dan
this ain't a sewn outfit, holmes, holmes is about it
was clappin' them flamers before i became famous
for playin' me, y'all shall forever remain nameless


i am hov (you don't know what you're doin'â€” doin'â€” doin'â€”)
sure i do


i tell you the difference between me and them
they tryin' to get they ones, i'm tryin' to get them m's
one million, two million, three million, four
in just five years, forty million more
you are now lookin' at the forty million boy
i'm rapin' def jam 'til i'm the hundred million man


r-o-c (you don't know what you're doin'â€” doin'â€” doin'â€”)
that's where you're wrong


i came into this motherfucker hundred grand strong
nine to be exact, from grindin' g-packs
put this shit in motion, ain't no rewindin' me back
could make forty off a brick, but one rhyme could beat that
and if somebody woulda told 'em that hov would sell clothin'
not in this lifetime, wasn't in my right mind
that's another difference that's between me and them
i smarten up, open the market up
one million, two million, three million, four
in eighteen months, eighty million more
now add that number up with the one i said before
you are now lookin' at one smart black boy
mama ain't raise no fool
put me anywhere on god's green earth, i'll triple my worth, motherfucker


i will not lose (you don't know what you're doin'â€” doin'â€” doin'â€”)
put somethin' on it


i sell ice in the winter, i sell fire in hell
i am a hustler, baby, i'll sell water to a whale
i was born to get cake, move on and switch states
cop the coupe with the roof gone and switch plates
was born to dictate, never follow orders, dick face
get your shit straight, fucker, this is big jay


iâ€” hahahaha (you don't know what you're doin'â€” doin'â€” doin'â€”)
will not lose, ever
fucker
