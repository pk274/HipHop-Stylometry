oh no, i never gave up no way (i never felt that before)
oh no, i never gave up no way (i never felt that before)
oh no, i never gave up no way (i never felt that before)
but there's always— that's all, that's all, baby (uh, uh)


this is the shit you dream about with the homies steaming out
back-to-back, backing them bimmers out
seems as our plans to get a grant
then go off to college didn't pan or even out
we need it now, we need a town
we need a place to pitch, we need a mound
for now, i'm just a lazy boy
daydreaming in my la-z-boy
in the clouds of smoke, been playing this marvin
mama, forgive me, should be thinking about harvard
but that's too far away, niggas is starving
nothing wrong with my aim, just gotta change the target
i got dreams of bagging snid-ow the size of pillows
i see pies every time my eyes clid-ose
i see rides, sixes, i gotta get those
life's a bitch, i hope to not make her a widow


oh no, i never gave up no way (i never felt that before)
american dreamin'
oh no, i never gave up no way (i never felt that before)
i'm just american dreamin'
oh no, i never gave up no way (i never felt that before)
american dreamin'
but there's always— that's all, that's all, baby (uh, uh)


now see the life's right there, and it seems right there
and it's not quite near, and it's not like we're
professionals, moving the decimals
know where to cop? nah, got a connect? no
who in the f knows how to be successful
need a personal jesus, i'm in depeche mode
they say its celestial, it's all in the stars
it's like tony la russa on how you play your cards
'cause y'all ain't fucking with me, the ironies are
at all costs, better avoid these bars
now let's start, on your mark
get set, let's go, get out the car
going in circles, it's a vicious cycle
this is a crash course, this ain't high school
wake up, muttley, you're dreaming again
your own reality show, the season begins


oh no, i never gave up no way (i never felt that before)
american dreamin'
oh no, i never gave up no way (i never felt that before)
i'm just american dreamin'
oh no, i never gave up no way (i never felt that before)
american dreamin'
but there's always— that's all, that's all, baby


step one in this process, scramble up in your projects
and head to the heights where big coke is processed
you gotta convince 'em that you're not from the precinct
please speak slow 'cause he no speaky no english
if he takes a liking after a couple of trips
and your money is straight, he's going to give you consignment
now in the game where only time can tell
survive the droughts, i wish you well— hold up
survive the droughts? i wish you well?
how sick am i? i wish you health
i wish you wheels, i wish you wealth
i wish you insight so you could see for yourself
you could see the signs when the jackers is scheming
and the cops is coming, you could read they mind
you could see from behind, you could redefine
the game as we know it, one dream at a time
i'm american dreamin'


oh no, i never gave up no way (i never felt that before)
american dreamin'
oh no, i never gave up no way (i never felt that before)
american dreamin'
oh no, i never gave up no way (i never felt that before)
american dreamin'
but there's always— that's all, that's all, baby


american dreamin'

roc-a-fella records
the imperial skateboard p
great hova
y'all already know what it is! (oh shit!)
c'mon! (woooo!)
yeah


so what if you flip a couple words? i could triple that in birds
open your mind, you see the circus in the sky
i'm ringling brothers, barnum & bailey with the pies
no matter how you slice it, i'm your motherfuckin' guy
and just like a b-boy with 360 waves
do the same with the pot, still come back beige
whether right or southpaw, whether pot or the jar
whip it around, it still comes back hard
so easily do i w-h-i-p
my repetition with wristses'll bring the kilo bidness
i got creole c.o. bitches for my niggas
who slipped, became prisoners, treats taped to the visitors
you already know what the bid-ness is
unnecessary commissary, boy, we live this shit
niggas wanna bring the '80s back
that's okay with me, that's where they made me at
except i don't write on the wall
i write my name in the history books, hustlin' in the hall
nah, i don't spin on my head
i spin my work in the pot, so i can spend my bread


and i'm gettin' it, i'm gettin' it
i ain't talkin' about it, i'm livin' it
i'm gettin' it, straight gettin' it
g—g—g—get— get— get it, boy
don't waste your time
fighting the life
stay your course
and you'll understand (get it, boy)


it's '87 state of mind that i'm in (mind that i'm in)
in my prime, so for that time, i'm rakim (i'm rakim)
if it wasn't for the crime that i was in
but i wouldn't be the guy who rhymes it is that i'm in (that i'm in)
no pain, no profit
p, i repeat if you show me where the pot is (pot is)
cherry m3's with the top back (top back)
red and green g's all on my hat
north beach leathers, matching gucci sweater
gucci sneaks on to keep my outfit together
whatever, hundred for the diamond chain
can't you tell that i came from the dope game?
blame reagan for making me into a monster
blame oliver north and iran-contra
i ran contraband that they sponsored
before this rhymin' stuff we was in concert


and i'm gettin' it, i'm gettin' it
i ain't talkin' about it, i'm livin' it
i'm gettin' it, straight gettin' it
g—g—g—get— get— get it, boy
don't waste your time
fighting the life
stay your course
and you'll understand (get it, boy)


ugh, push
money over broads, you got it—fuck bush
chef, guess what i cooked?
baked a lot of bread and kept it off the books
rockstar, look
way before the bars, my picture was getting took
feds, they like wack rappers
try as they may, they couldn't get me on the hook, ugh
d.a. wanna indict me
'cause fishscale's in my veins like a pisces
the pyrex pot, rolled up my sleeves
turn one into two like a siamese twin
when it end, i'ma stand as a man
never dying on my knees, last of a dying breed
so let the champagne pop
i partied for a while; now, i'm back to the block


and i'm gettin' it, i'm gettin' it
i ain't talkin' about it, i'm livin' it
i'm gettin' it, straight gettin' it
g—g—g—get— get— get it, boy
don't waste your time
fighting the life
stay your course
and you'll understand (get it, boy)


uhh, said where i would stop before i even started
when i get to one brick, then the game i would depart with
got to one brick then i looked to the sky like:
"sorry, god, i lied, but give me one more try" (try)
got to two bricks, new cars, new whips
but niggas never learn until they end up in the news clip
the irony of selling drugs is sort of like you using it
guess it's two sides to what substance abuse is
can't stop, won't stop, addicted to this new shit
brand new convertibles, i'm so ruthless
front row fight night, see how big my tube is
fuck hd, nigga, see how clear my view is?
but there's a price for overdoing it
doing it this big'll put you on the map, stick-up kids is out to tax
plus the fbi boys with the cameras in the back
damn...


i know i shouldn’t of did that
i know it's gon' come right back
i know it's gon' destroy everything i made
it's probably gon' get ya boy sent away
but this game i play, ain't no way to fix it
it's inevitable (now ya) fallin'


when you should've fell back
now you (fallin'), right into they lap
fallin', they applauding, they screaming at the screen
damn, you fucked up like your favorite movie scene
godfather, goodfellas, scarface, casino
you seen what that last run did to de niro in heat
can't beat the odds, can't cheat the gods
can't blow too hard, life's a deck of cards
now your tumbling is humbling, you're falling, you're mumbling
under your breath like you knew this day was coming (fallin')
now let's pray that arm candy
that you left your ex for stay down and come in handy
'cause come january it gets cold, when the letters start to slow
and your commissary's low and lawyers screams appeal
only thinking about a bill and your chances are nil
damn, gravity's ill...


i know i shouldn’t of did that
i know it's gon' come right back
i know it's gon' destroy everything i made
it's probably gon' get ya boy sent away
but this game i play, ain't no way to fix it
it's inevitable (but ya) fallin'


and you can't get up
all you do is push-up, pull-up, sit-up
locked down the town now belongs to the squares
who said they won't make the same mistake that got you there
and your arm candy sweet on 'em
and the women that you left for this heifer
got a college degree coming
bad news keeps coming, hard to keep something on your stomach
you're sick about what your life is becoming (fallin')
but your use-to's, has-beens, ragging bad about all the new dudes
talking tough on the youtube 'bout what you used to do
but that's old school to the new crew
they doing numbers like sudoku
they're the new you, and it's damn near inevitable
they'll experience déja vu too
fight and you'll never survive
run and you'll never escape, so just fall from grace
damn...



hello, brooklyn (uh-huh), how you doing? (yeah)
where you going? can i come too? (uh-huh)
and if i can (woo!), i'ma be your man

'cause i'm so taken, if you taken (i'm so taken)
i'm just saying (woo!), baby, i'm just saying


like a mama, you birth me; brooklyn, you nursed me
schooled me with hard knocks, better than berkeley
they said you'd murk me by the time i was 21
that shit disturbed me, but you never hurt me
hello, brooklyn, if we had a daughter
guess what i'ma call her? brooklyn carter
when i left you for virginia, it didn't offend you
'cause you know i only stepped out to get dinner
and i'm eating, so much, i bought extra
so much so that dinner's now turned into breakfast
i only roll lexus to hug your road
i love your corners, i'm half your soul


hello, brooklyn, how you doing?
where you going? can i come too?
and if i can, i'ma be your man

wherever you going, baby girl, just take me
'cause i'm so taken if you taken
i'm just saying, baby, i'm just saying


and "hello, brooklyn!" buh-baby, you are
the sweetest sight eyes could see
i said, "hello, brooklyn!" buh-baby
i hope you never say goodbye to me
i said, "hello, brooklyn!" buh-buh-baby, you are (woo!)
so damn fine to me
and i remember the time (time), place (place)
and the weather (and, woo!)
on the day you said, "hi," to me
and i say, "hello, brooklyn!"


brooklyn, you crazy; look how you made me
razor blades in my mouth, walking 'round, behaving—
all demented; black hoodies and timberland-ed
always scheming—"you see the gleam on that nigga's pendant?"
(hello, brooklyn) you bad influence, look what you had me doing
but i ain't mad at you (haha), look at my attitude
it says my life's too real, check out my ice grill
baby, i'm cold as ice, like i'm from brownsville
but my bed's in the stuy, though i'll lie flat in your bush
'til we smoke a c.i., "what up" to the boy, b.i.?
you know i handle b-i, i don't half-step on the 'caine
ask the dreads 'bout i, how you gwaan 'so?
she like it hardcore, so i grind slow
iller than albee square mall back in the 9-0
my fine ho, we got some victims to catch
so in a couple years, baby, i'ma bring you some nets (woo!)



ugh, ugh, yessir!
just the sound of his voice is a hit, hehe

i make some thought-provoking shit, y'all question whether he fallin' off
i'ma really confuse y'all on this one
follow!


when them tops come down, chicks' tops come down
like when them shots come out, make cops come around
when them blocks come out, i can wake up a small town
finish off the block, then i make my mall rounds
stares get exchanged, then the fifth come out
the tough guy disappear, then the bitch come out
"that's him!"—i'm usually what they whisper 'bout
either what chick he with, or his chip amount
'cause i been doin' this since chips was out
watchin' erik estrada, baggin' up at the ramada
table full of powder, a/c broke
'bout to take another shower on my 25th hour
spike lees everywhere, game or the flight
you might see me anywhere, a day in the life
only thing changed the tail number on the flight
i can touch down and take off the same night
i'm so bossy, bitch, get off me
trick, get off me, you can't get shit off me
i'm so flossy, no sixes on sprees
laid-back, maybachs, don't even talk to me


this is that ignorant shit you like
nigga, fuck, shit, ass, bitch, trick, plus ice, c'mon
i got that ignorant shit you love
nigga, fuck, shit, maricón, puta, and drugs, c'mon

they're all actors
lookin' at themselves in the mirror backwards
can't even face themselves
don't fear no rappers, they're all weirdos, de niros in practice
so don't believe everything your earlobe captures
it's mostly backwards, unless it happens to be as accurate as me
and everything said in song, you happen to see
then, actually, believe half of what you see
none of what you hear, even if it's spat by me
and with that said, i will kill niggas dead
cut niggas short, give you wheels for legs
i'm a k-i-double-l-e-r, see y'all in hell
shoot niggas straight through the er, whoa!
this ain't b.r., no
it's s.c., ceo, the next lyor
no, the next leader of the whole free world
and the first thing i'ma do is free sigel—go!


i missed the part when it stopped bein' 'bout imus
what do my lyrics got to do with this shit?
scarface the movie did more than scarface the rapper to me
still that ain't to blame for all the shit that's happened to me
are you saying what i'm spittin'
is worse than these celebutantes showin' they kitten? you kiddin'?
let's stop the bullshittin'
'til we all without sin, let's quit the pulpittin'
scarface the movie did more than scarface the rapper to me
still that ain't to blame for all the shit that's happened to me
let's stop the bullshittin'
'til we all without sin, let's quit the pulpittin', c'mon


this is that ignorant shit you like
nigga, fuck, shit, ass, bitch, trick, plus ice, c'mon
i got that ignorant shit you love
nigga, fuck, shit, maricón, puta, and drugs, c'mon
i got that ignorant shit you need
nigga, fuck, shit, ass, bitch, trick, plus weed, c'mon

bonita applebum, i gotta put you on

like every color giuseppe's, your guilty pleasure is me
it's so much fun, you shun therapy
although it never be, the feeling is fleeting
shopping's like copping, you constantly need it
i'm never around, you constantly seek it
you'll never be down, i know where your peak is
9 1/2 weeks is better than 12-steps
i keep trying to remind you to keep telling yourself

how could you leave me?
i thought that you needed me!
when the world got too much and you pleaded with me
who helped you immediately? how speedy of me!
how could you deny me so vehemently?
now your body is shaking, trying to free it of me
and your soul is in control, trying to lead it from me
and your heart no longer pledge allegiance to me
damn, i'm missing the days when you needed the d!

look, mind state of a gangster from the 40s
meets the business mind of motown's berry gordy
turned crack rock into a chain of 40/40's
sorry, my jewelry's so gaudy
slid into the party with my new pair of mauris
america, meet the gangster shawn corey
"hey, young world," wanna hear a story?
close your eyes and you can pretend you're me
i'm cut from the cloth of the kennedys
frank sinatra having dinner with the genovese
this is the genesis of a nemesis
mother america's not witnessed since
the harlem renaissance birthed black businesses
this is the tale of lost innocence
as the incense burn
and the turntables turn and that al green plays
i see my mother's afro
as mama taps her toes, as she rolls her j's
and my papa just left the house
in search of the killer of my uncle ray
and she's trying to calm her nerves
as i observe, this is just one day
and what tomorrow has in store, we can never be sure
so all we can do is pray


as i head to my homeroom
i observe the ruins, dope needles on the ground
i hear a car go, "vroom"
drug dealer in the bm with the top down
as the girls start to giggle
i ask, "why you laugh?" they say, "you're too little"
"one day, you'll understand when you become a man
about things you have to get you"
fast-forward, freeze-frame on my pistol
fistful of dollars, ignorance is so blissful
i didn't choose this life, this life chose me
around here, it's the shit that you just do
i just left school
the same bm is pulled over by the boys dressed blue
they had their guns drawn, screaming, "just move!" ("don't move!")
"or is there something else you suggest we can do?"
he made his way to the trunk, opened it like, "huh?"
a treasure chest was removed
cops said he'll be back next month
what we call corrupt, he calls paying dues
now, when the rules is blurred—
as they is and were—what am i to do?
but pray? pray the lord forgive me
pray he guides me by for what i'm 'bout to go through
pray


geah... anywhere there's oppression
the drug profession flourishes like beverages, refreshing
ahh! sweet taste of sin
everything i seen made me everything i am
bad drug dealer or victim, i beg
what came first? moving chickens or the egg?
this is why i be so fresh
i'm tryna beat life 'cause i can't cheat death
treat shame with shamelessness
aim stainlesses at anuses
you know the game this is?
move coke like pepsi, don't matter what the brand name is
i stand behind mine
everything i do, i'm a man behind mine
i'm not an angel, i'm sure
but every night before i lay, i drop my knees to the floor
and i pray



and the winner is hov,,
my man
speech!

so i ain't paying attention to what you're saying
raindrops keep falling on my brain
'cause i'm in the drop on flames
i'm so hot even if the weather change
i don't have no top, i'm insane
'member dark-skinned jermaine
suede in the rain, i'm sorta kinda the same
'cept i'm no lame and you gonna know my name
before i go the world gon' feel my pain

... let me tell you what i ain't
we ain't thugs for the sake of just being thugs
nobody do that where we grew at, nigga duh
the poverty line we not above
so out comes the mask and gloves 'cause we ain't feeling the love
we ain't doin crime for the sake of doing crimes
we movin dimes 'cause we ain't doing fine
one out of three of us is locked up doing time
you know what this type of shit can do to a nigga mind
my mind on my money, money on my mind
if you owe me ten dollars you ain't giving me nine
y'all ain't give me forty acres and a mule
so i got my glock 40 now i'm cool
and if al sharpton is speaking for me
somebody give him the word and tell him i don't approve
tell him i remove the curses
if you tell me our schools gon' be perfect
when jena six don't exist
tell him that's when i'll stop saying bitch, beeeitch!

sweeeet... and still there's pain (pain, pain, pain...)
if i would have grew up to be a doctor
my nephews would have grew up to do the same (same, same...)
but since i grew up through the game
and my influence is the same
and my therapy is music
they ask if you ashamed (ashamed...)
and though i wish i could separate the two things
i cannot so my answer to you remains
i can walk down the hall of mirrors in versailles
and be so satisfied when i look myself in the eyes
no shame, no sir
just big boats and tearing the coast up
tight coupes like i'm wearing the roadster
for any coupe, bear-hugging the holster


hov', alright al-right
and it may not be what you call perfect, but
but it's my life (uh)
the life (uh-uh), the life (uh-uh), the life
once again it's the life


so i make no apologies, crooked policies
so a g a nigga gotta be
we playing for property, no monopoly
so i'll pass go and let my nephew follow me
they say the child shall lead
so i take it far as i can and then we shall see
shall we dance with the devil for a beat
i pray to god i ain't got two left feet
do the hustle put keys in the street
then i'm ballroom dancing
ke-ke'in in the suite
sweet, bb's on the feet
tv's in the seat, ene-mies on the creep
it's so corrupt
soak it up, it's a lesson, every fuck up
one day you're up
next day you're down
long as you stay the same it'll come back around


hov', alright al-right
and it may not be what you call perfect, but
but it's my life (uh)
the life (uh-uh), the life (uh-uh), the life
once again it's the life


i'm even better
i'm eating better
best thing about it is
my niggas eating together
with each endeavor, we reaching levels
niggas ain't seen in like forever
i'm hyman roth, so made all my partners rich
i can't vouch for you
if you ain't a part of this
so pardon me as i pave my wrist, uh
as i parlay my chips
hov', alright al-right
american gangster, gangster
businesses like i'm white
but i'm not, i'm just bright
so fly with no fear of the flight, uhh
so if y'all hear my plight
and if you think you can make it this far without a fight
couple mistakes here and there
not always right, but i'm always real
that's how i sleep at night


hov', alright al-right
and it may not be what you call perfect, but
but it's my life (uh)
the life (uh-uh), the life (uh-uh), the life
once again it's the life


sweeeet...
