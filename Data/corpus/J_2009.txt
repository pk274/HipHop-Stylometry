thank you, thank you very much for coming out this evening


thank you, thank you, thank you, please hold your applause
for i just applied logic—keys, keys open doors
now i'm balcony, opera, black tux, binocular
black luxe, stop it, i shouldn't be so popular
name keep poppin' up, face keep poppin' up
on the tube, i'm just watchin' pacquaio box 'em up
how would i know hbo would get a shot of us?
sittin' so close that we almost got snot on us
please don't bow in my presence—how am i a legend?
i just got ten #1 albums, maybe now eleven?
more hits than a now 11; that is no reason
to treat me like i'm somehow from outta heaven
heaven knows that i've made my mistakes
thank god, what a guy, as i say my grace!
who woulda thought by makin' birds migrate for the winter
i be fly all summer? might i say


hovi baby, we are really high, really high tonight
we tip the waiter a hundred dollars to keep the ice cold, alright
we the last ones to keep the wise guys code alive
if i can't live by my word, then i'd much rather die
no no, don't thank me, this is just how my suit is stitched
i'm cut from a different cloth, i'm just who the shoe fits
for the color of money like a tom cruise flick
'cept i put eight balls in corners without usin' pool sticks
beautiful music when champagne flutes click, eh
beautiful women sippin' through rouge lips, eh
dangers approaches, we're like: "wait, who's this?"
let us save you some trouble, son, what size suit you is?
this way after the ruger shoots through a few clips
you can lay in your casket just as you is
we appreciate the target practices
we'll be sure to send flower baskets, kid


i was gonna kill a couple rappers, but they did it to themselves
i was gon' do it with the flow, but they did it with their sales
i was gon' 9/11 'em, but they didn't need the help
and they did a good job, them boys is talented as hell
'cause not only did they brick, they put a building up as well
then ran a plane into that building and when that building fell
ran to the crash site with no masks and inhaled
toxins deep inside their lungs until both of them was filled
blew a cloud out like a l into a jar, then took a smell
'cause they heard that second hand smoke kills
niggas thought they was ill, found out they was ill
and it's like you knew exactly how i wanted you to feel


we are really high, really really high, no
really really high, really high tonight, ha
we are really high, really high tonight
we are really high, really high tonight
lucky lefty,, kiss the wife goodnight for me, hehe

if hov's a blackberry bold, then shorty is a sidekick
she used to have a man; i used to have a side-chick
shorty got wind; i had to blow the chick off
she got rid of him; they both took the shit hard
shorty played the piano; me, i played with white keys
shorty from the south—oh, i think she like me
shorty like pac; me, big poppa
she screaming, "hit 'em up!" i'm screaming "who shot ya?"
i'm on that red wine; shorty like white
same shit, different toilet; we both getting nice

she's a pc: she lives in my lap

whether black or white, we both like mike
we both like jordans, we both phil's knight
i finish my breakfast, shorty's out to lunch
yeah we both eating, it's better than brunch
shorty like pepsi, me i'm the coke man
body like a coke bottle, i crush it like a coke can
started at the window, end up at the wall
the yin to my yang, i skeet skeet off
in a salt and pepper 'bach, shorty like to front
the bonnie to my clyde, both riding shotgun
both covered in gold like c3p0
james and florida evans, let the good times roll

shorty get it in, venus versus mars


thought shorty was the truth, found out she was a cheater
we were supposed to take over, i caught her bumping "ether"
i thought shorty liked mike, found out she liked prince
thought she was adrian, it's been rocky ever since
my dollars was down, she left me for some euros
took my whole flavor, i call her coke zero
we were co-mvp's like kobe and shaq
left me for the heat, we were winning back to back
said i party too much, shorty got fed up
shorty got britney, shaved her whole head up
we used to make out, kissing each other's face off
fell for the ponzi scheme, damn shorty just made off


shorty get it in, but daddy go hard
shorty get it in, da-da-daddy go hard
shorty get it in, but daddy go hard
shorty get it in, da-da-daddy go hard
shorty get it in, but daddy go hard

all through prada, but what if i had nada?
would the babe even bother if the block got hotter?
in the never-ending game that pits the cops versus robbers?
am i your clyde, or are you just along for the ride?
when i'm blasting out the window, will you grab the wheel and drive?


when the money goes, will the honey stay?
when the gray skies replace the sunny days?
hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, uh
when the money goes, will the honey stay?
when the gray skies replace the sunny days?
hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, uh


when i fall off, and the drought hits
and it knocks me, out new outfits
and the charm you got gotta hit the pawn shop
and you feel like crying, but be strong and stop
it was all good just a week ago
now i'm wearing the same clothes a week in a row
trying to scratch back
would she take a little check from her little job like
"nigga, you can have that"
you have belief in me, or would you beef with me?
is the good life the only thing you needed from me?
would she roll out? is she so out, when the stoves out?
or will she hold out?


when the money goes, will the honey stay?
when the gray skies replace the sunny days?
hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, uh
when the money goes, will the honey stay?
when the gray skies replace the sunny days?
hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, uh


and your friends know what hov get it in for
but let's just say that i didn't ride benzo
would you say, "girl, why you still with him for?"
and if so, babe, why you around them hoes?
all they see is paper, not potential
and they don't have a nigga's back when he's in limbo
and i ain't asking you to do a life bid with me
i don't want you to die for me, baby, live with me
i'm just saying, when the going gets rough
don't forget all the shine at the time i was showing up
show me the same love you showed me when blowing up
you told me it was roc for life, then throw it up


when the money goes, will the honey stay?
when the gray skies replace the sunny days?
hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, uh
when the money goes, will the honey stay?
when the gray skies replace the sunny days?
hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, uh

forever young, i wanna be forever young
do you really want to live forever, forever, and ever? (uh)
forever young (young), i wanna be forever young (forever young)
(ayy, may the best of your todays be the worst of your tomorrows)
do you really want to live forever, forever? forever young
(but we ain't even thinkin' that far, ya know what i mean?)


so we living life like a video (video)
where the sun is always out and you never get old
and the champagne's always cold and the music's always good
and the pretty girls just happen to stop by in the hood
and they hop they pretty ass up on the hood of that pretty ass car
without a wrinkle in today 'cause there's no tomorrow
just a picture-perfect day that last a whole lifetime
and it never ends 'cause all we have to do is hit rewind
so let's just stay in the moment, smoke some weed, drink some wine
reminisce, talk some shit, forever young is in your mind
leave a mark they can't erase, neither space nor time
so when the director yells cut, i'll be fine
i'm forever young


fear not when, fear not why, fear not much while we're alive
life is for living, not living uptight, 'til you're somewhere up in the sky
fear not die, i'll be alive for a million years, bye bye's
are not for legends, i'm forever young, my name shall survive
through the darkest blocks, over kitchen stoves, over pyrex pots
my name shall be passed down to generations
while debating up in barbershops
young slung, hung here, showed that a nigga from here
with a little ambition, just what we can become here (yeah)
and as the father pass the story down to his son's ears
young'll get younger every year, yeah
so if you love me, baby, this is how you let me know
don't ever let me go, that's how you let me know, baby


forever young, i wanna be forever young
do you really want to live forever, forever, and ever?
forever young, i wanna be forever young (forever young)
do you really want to live forever, forever? forever young
(just let it run)


slamming bentley doors, hopping outta porsches
popping up on forbes' list, gorgeous (hold up)
niggas thought i lost it, they be talking bullshit
i be talking more shit, they nauseous (hold up)
i'll be here forever, you know i'm on my fall shit
and i ain't with foreclosure, i will never forfeit
less than four bars, guru bring the chorus in
did you get the picture yet?
i'm painting you a portrait of young
