you just gon' fake it 'til you make it, huh?
rented houses on mtv, you tapin' them
fine hoes in your videos, you drapin' them
green screens of the projects, you safe in them!
fine cars in your videos, you pay for them?
shit, i can't knock your hustle, though, you make it fun
dear rappers: you been fooling the public
people starting to think y'all real, do something!
see what we do when niggas do 200?
it's on like the platinum to us; chew, snuff 'em
back to life, you're not reality
your salary is like celery
we eatin' over here, nigga, you're like salad to me!
get your weight up, get your steak up
those little acres, get your estate up
to face us, you're gon' need an island
it's imaginary players take 2000, you're gutted!


you gutted, yeah, yeah, you gutted
you talking 'bout that bread but your bread ain't buttered
yeah, yeah, you gutted, uh, uh, you gutted!
you talking ace of spades but you balling on a budget!
yeah, yeah, you gutted, yeah, yeah, you gutted
(you see us, vip, gold bottles in them buckets
yeah, you gutted, yeah, yeah, you gutted
when the roc boys in the house, open bar, we got it covered!)
