time to separate
the platinum from the white gold, right from the door
the real from the fake, ready rock from the raw
the boss from the runners, cats who ride dick
from the cats with the numbers, the five from the six
i got cop ‘n crash money, pop the dash money
press the button, all of sudden, glock in the stash money
beef with jigga, watch yo' ass money
it's el presidente, top brass money
now i don't flash the steel, i blast for real
my motto: you only good as the last nigga you kill
i'm here to snatch this mil, nigga that's for real
if you rolling with me grab the wheel, let's ride huh?
