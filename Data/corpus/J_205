haters—these niggas is haters!
and i made myself so easy to love

hoover? hova
both are american gangsters
you choose who's colder
rappers get nasty in the booth but i'm grosser
i can’t even stomach myself: ulcer
more realer 'cause i'm closer
had girlies in girdles weighing more than they supposed to
poser? no, sir
my hustle: so russell
i stretch work: yoga
you know i got it down, dog
al roker: i used to knock pounds off
it ain’t nothing for me to knock nouns off
and these mcs praying for my downfall
they just haters
i wave at you, i’m so player
i’ll never be done, i’m so ra-re


we ballin', bitches
eating y'all food, leaving dishes
why these niggas always talking lear talk, 'ye?
why i never see 'em at the clearport, 'ye?
why always hear they at the airport?
while i fly daily like i'm in the air force (ayy)
therefore, please stop talking my ears off, millionaire talk
you haters, you mad at me 'cause your paper
need to get its motherfucking weight up
(hold up) wait up, i ain’t done
name one thing i ain’t done
it hurts when you say that i ain't the one
you haters, how do i gain your favor?
i need to know 'cause i care
i need you to love me, i swear—look here!

i'm running new york, i got the mayor on my pager
you can’t fade us, you haters

i breathe you like air
