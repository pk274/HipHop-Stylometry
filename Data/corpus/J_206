(aaooowwww!!!) it's so rock and roll
jay skateboarder...


i be the king of the roc, there is none higher
fuck 'jay-z' - y'all should call me sire
i won't stop rocking 'til i retire
i got lyor rich, y'all got niggas fired
i'm a cash cow, nigga, i'm 'bout to cash out
'bout to drop the black album and back out
i ain't gotta come back out to pull that maybach out the garage
rap's my hobby, spending money's my job
army in the cup (cup), giorgio armani special cut
scooby doo's walkin' on you mutts
i'm back on it the famous face with the mask on it
playin' laser tag with the mag, you can not want it
you can get it in a new york minute
i draw a square and i dare you to walk in it
listen, you're a square, don't get your corner bended
you're a circle, i will hurt you, you're a zero, i'm a hero
i should fear no man but god
yet and still i could chill in the city of god's in brazil
i'm that real was selling crack in the building
back when selling crack in the building was a big deal, i'm that chill
it's like having ice on the face of a watch when i enter the spot time stands still
ill, check out the metaphors i build
made me bigger than u.s steel, tell em' phar-real


you think that you don't have to ever quit
you think that you can get away with it
you think the light won't be ever lit
it's almost over now (the game is hova's now)
something on your chest, better get it off
they'll be no one left when we set it off
we ain't gonna take it no more
said it's almost over now (the game is hova's now)


you, can't be me, i'm a rock star
i'm rhymin on the top of a cop's car
i'm a rebel and my .44 pops far
(it's almost over now, the game is hova's now)
i guess, you ain't heard that we swallow guys
it's too damn late to apologize
when you see the mantle or will you see the skies
(it's almost over now, the game is hova's now.. nigga!)

(it's almost over now, the game is hova's now)
