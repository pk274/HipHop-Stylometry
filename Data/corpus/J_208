i ain't playing, life's short so i aim
i ain't waiting for life start betraying 'em
it's twice as hard to get a job that's paying 'em
so i ain't paying attention to what you're saying
raindrops keep falling on my brain
'cause i'm in the drop on flames
i'm so hot even if the weather change
i don't have no top, i'm insane
'member dark-skinned jermaine
suede in the rain, i'm sorta kinda the same
'cept i'm no lame and you gonna know my name
before i go the world gon' feel my pain
they saying i'm a bad guy, why's that?
'cause when my back's against the wall, nigga i react
secretly though, i know you admire that
you wish you had the balls to fire back, brrrap!
say hello, uhh uh, hello, uhh uh
you wish you had the balls to fire back, brrap!

before my name became jigga
before i sang i had that thang on slippers
can't complain 'bout what they ain't gon' give ya
that ain't gon' get ya shit, might as well give up
or get up, get out and get something nigga
get a job my nigga, or get to dumping
only god can judge him, only he without sin
tell me if my means, justify my ends
'til then, i'm just gon' fly in the benz
wire my friends through western union
shhhhh, supplies in
my system knocking, here comes the bad guy again
say hello, uhh uh, hello, uhh uh
hello, uhh here comes the bad guy again

... let me tell you what i ain't
we ain't thugs for the sake of just being thugs
nobody do that where we grew at, nigga duh
the poverty line we not above
so out comes the mask and gloves 'cause we ain't feeling the love
we ain't doin crime for the sake of doing crimes
we movin dimes 'cause we ain't doing fine
one out of three of us is locked up doing time
you know what this type of shit can do to a nigga mind
my mind on my money, money on my mind
if you owe me ten dollars you ain't giving me nine
y'all ain't give me forty acres and a mule
so i got my glock 40 now i'm cool
and if al sharpton is speaking for me
somebody give him the word and tell him i don't approve
tell him i remove the curses
if you tell me our schools gon' be perfect
when jena six don't exist
tell him that's when i'll stop saying bitch, beeeitch!
