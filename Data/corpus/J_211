she wanna shop with jay, play box with jay
she wanna pillow fight in the middle of the night
she wanna drive my benz with five of her friends
she wanna creep past the block, spyin' again
she wanna roll with jay, chase skeeos away
she wanna fight with lame chicks, blow my date
she wanna inspect the rest, kick me to the curb
if she finds one strand of hair longer than hers
she wants love in the jacuzzi, rub up in the movies
access to the old crib, keys to the newbie
she wanna answer the phone, tattoo her arm
that's when i gotta send her back to her mom's
she call me heartbreaker, when we apart it makes her
want a piece of paper, scribble down 'i hate ya'
but she knows she loves jay because
she loves everything jay says, jay does and all
