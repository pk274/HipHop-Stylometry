twist the lime on the corona, grab my crime diploma
then head to the block, to pull up five in the mona
shit, i need to chrome up, become a home owner
look lifes a bitch, but im on her
i almost cracked this, no more hustling backwards
up the ave i zip, nigga trying to have shit
im your average, ghetto nigga turned maverick
you'd never, said to a nigga "whateve for the cash, im with"
i dont have step, i leave it in youre averix
then shoot it it the air, whateva i have left
outlaw, simply i out draw y'all
wether clubs or the street, i out ball y'all
niggas ain't ready, i doubt all y'all
fly ass niggas i reroute all y'all
if it ain't for the paper i dont show my face up
make a bet i turn the ace up, $hort and jay, what


hoes, flows, money, cars
y'all wannabe stars can't fuck with none of these bars
this is real nigga rap, we can spit it through the mic
and you can feel niggas scratch, and sell a mil if that
so real when we drop this shit its in trouble
when i guess the pair you gotta ship it double
in the independent phenom, y'all minature dons
wannabe jigga, pops styles and hennessy richa'
when i die, leave my canopy richa'
i put it down hard ever since i entered the pit'cha
can fuck with me for records to the recreational cent'a
i got it wrapped y'all from the grammys to the back park
short dog y'all, what you thought y'all, oakland, bk, new york y'all
be the voice for the streets we supply for years
and go platinum on our most quiet years
