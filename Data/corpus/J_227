yeah, i know you just ripped the packaging off your cd
if you like me you reading the credits right now
if you in your car, i don't care if it's winter
i want you to put all your windows down
zone out, buckle up, let's go


hello it's hova; that's right young'un the wait is over
the new millennium is upon us, the album is here
before we get into the shit, let's get a few things clear
rappers with no relation:
there's "seven degrees of separation" and i'm kevin bacon
this is the murderer's version
jigga the shit, even when he rhyme in third person
hova the god, i should be rapping with a turban
haters can't disturb him, waiters can't serve him
mike jordan of rap, outside jay working
now watch how quickly i drop 50
i don't like playing, niggas can't stick me
niggas can not jam me, niggas can't get me
slimmy at the rucker wanna leave and spend with me
i consistently take em out the park like ken griffey
do you believe? it's hova the god
