hurricanes, hurricane
hurricanes, hurricane (oh, oh-my-my)
when i wake up to the sound of it rainin'
i can't stop it, i can hear you complainin'
hurricanes, hurricane
hurricanes, hurricane (oh-my-my)


all my users, all my devices
can't hear me anymore, how i'm losin'
waste my time making things right
waste my time, waste my time, i will start again
'cause i'm trying to realize how i am
and i'm sure of that dream
and if you wanna, you can just go ahead
i know that you know that it's true
you can just say that it's true
but i'm sure of what you mean
you're never going to wake me up
can't you hear the time? pow-pow, ooh
if you think i'm doing you a more a fool
yeah, we're not that far from the truth
i will close the door but, before i walk out of you
i will close the door but, before i walk out of you
i am a road maps journey with me on my knees
i am road maps journey with you on your knees
