i hustle hard in any hustle that you pitch
skinny nigga toothpick
but i do lift weights like i'm using roids
rolls royce keep my movements, smooth while maneuvering
through all the manure in the sewer that i grew up in
choices we make trying to escape
and i don’t need no hook for this shit
this is not for commercial usage
please don’t categorize this as music
please don’t compare me to other rappers
compare me to trappers
i’m more frank lucas than ludacris
and luda's my dude
i ain't trying to diss
like frank lucas is cool, but i ain't trying to snitch
i’ma follow the rules no matter how much time i’ma get
i’ma live and die with the decisions that i’ma pick
so fuck the haven for caving, that’s why we don’t speak
made men ain't supposed to make statements
end of the story i followed the code, cracked the safe
other niggas ain't in the game so they practice hate
hustle hard in any hustle that you pitch
