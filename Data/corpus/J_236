uh-huh, uh
jigga man, uh-huh mc
that's right
swizz beatz
uh, uh, come on


it's the things that you do
that make me feel so
(come on, inhale, exhale, breathe on it for me)
and i don't know the way i feel
i can't explain
(uh)
i love you
you thug you, look what you make the clubs do
(bounce, bounce)
it's the things that you do
that make me feel so
(exhale, breathe on it for me)
and i don't know the way i feel
i can't explain (yeah)
i love you
(uh come on)
you thug you, look what you make the clubs do


you know the flow sicker, know jigga, mo' sicker now right
you know what me and swizz's shit sound like
crazed and demonic, uh, without blazin' chronic
product of reaganomics
you know that motherfuckin' stoop raised me
ringin' in the hoops but i was too lazy
school made me sick, teachers said i was too crazy
low and behold, it's the new and improved jay-z
let me explain this to you, baby
i spent nights out, days in
niggas was blazing
twelve noon where i was raised in
i felt caged in but kept roaming
prayed for the day of atonement
married to the streets no date of annulment
it seems every time it comes up, they postpone it
so i kept my chrome at the waist, waiting for the omen
savoring the moment and now you know
the reason that i flow the way i flow, baby


it's the things that you do
that make me feel so
(come on, inhale, exhale, breathe on it for me)
and i don't know the way i feel
i can't explain
(uh)
i love you
you thug you, look what you make the clubs do
(bounce, bounce)
it's the things that you do
that make me feel so
(exhale breathe on it for me)
and i don't know the way i feel
i can't explain (yeah)
i love you
(uh come on)
you thug you, look what you make the clubs do


you know i move like an ounce
bottled up like crack
that's how i make you bounce like that
defy webster's words they can't pronounce like that
that's why no other rapper got a sound like that
trap, trap of my life
flashback, kill niggas
rap skills unmatched, jigga man baby
i can't entertain it sometimes i can't explain it
god given, guess it was all for hard living
far be it from me to question allah's wisdom
could've been lost in the system
instead i'm involved with the rhythm
i dodged prison, came out unscathed from car collisions
i know i must be part of some mission
shit, i used take it for granted
why they placed me on this planet
i would ask myself while writin' raps to myself
but right there under my nose
was the flow of all flows
not a demon but a rose in the cement, come on


it's the things that you do
that make me feel so
(come on, inhale, exhale, breathe on it for me)
and i don't know the way i feel
i can't explain
(uh)
i love you
you thug you, look what you make the clubs do
(bounce, bounce)
it's the things that you do
that make me feel so
(exhale breathe on it for me)
and i don't know the way i feel
i can't explain (yeah)
i love you
(uh come on)
you thug you, look what you make the clubs do


you know i've traveled through zones
homes spazzed like a bad back
i came into this game on jaz's back
i jumped off stood on my own two like boom, that's that
yeah i'm here to show and prove
don't matter to me the garden or flowin' on clue
whatever niggas wanna do - it's alright with me
whether you big or bossy, jig or flossy
dusty or musty, sober or saucy
broker than todd bridges, richer than bill cosby
forgive me for my arrogance or you still salty?
past on to the next life and you still haunt me
i'ma keep doing me unfortunately
i make the club rock, make thugs pop guns
make old folks do the bus stop; can't stop son
shit i give you what's hot and what's not, i never knew
y'all (niggas) know (niggas) how (niggas) do


it's the things that you do that make me feel so
(uh, exhale, inhale)
and i don't know the way i feel
i can explain
i love you
you thug you, look what you make the clubs do
(uh, bounce, shake, what? uh-huh)
it's the things that you do that make me feel so
(uh-huh, inhale, exhale)
and i don't know the way i feel i can explain
i love you
you thug you, look what you make the clubs do
(bounce, shake ladies)
it's the things that you do that make me feel so
(uh-huh, breathe for me, uh, uh-huh)
and i don't know the way i feel
i can explain
(uh)
i love you
you thug you, look what you make the clubs do
