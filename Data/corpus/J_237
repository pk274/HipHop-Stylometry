i said i see some ladies in here tonight i might marry (marry)
gone off the belve' and 'tron it's too scary (scary)
baby, you can have whatever you like, the tooth fairy
i'll do anything to leave here tonight with you, cherie
i said i do, i do, i do, i do, i do (you know i do)
i said i do, i do, i do, i do, i do (you know i do)
i said i do, i do, i do, i do, i do (you know i do)
(yeah, man, that boy so cold, give him a blanket in here)
i said i do, i do, i do, i do, i do (yeah)



i d-o, i d-o, i d-o, oh, oh
i, vito, promise to treat this game, i-de-al
honor the code, not bring drama to mama’s peephole
life’s a bitch but she's the only love that i know-ow-ow
so la-a-dy, after the "i do's" let's do mercedes
let's tie the knot, let's grab us a pot, let's make a baby
looking back, i don't know who threw this bouquet to me
but i walk down this aisle faithfully, cut that cake for me
i, jay-z, take this unlawful lady to have and to hold
and until the task force roll
to hug her every corner 'til i get ash from the cold
or until i've amassed a fortune, too much cash for me to fold
fold under pressure i would never, ever, ever (ever), ever (ever)
your secrets i treasure, for better or worser
you'll always be my first love 'til death do us part
pull a hearse up, my verse up
