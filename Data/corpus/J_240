right, right
yo, peep the scripts, scoped honey from the whip
jumped out like "yo, who the fuck you with?"
flash the jewels 'cause that's the rule
damn, i like a girl who spend a little cash for her shoes
face natural â€” can i get at you?
saw a spot on the body look nice with a tattoo
with my name, but didn't want to jump the gun
i ain't know how many niggas was humping hon
i said i never seen a face like yours before
and i been around some cute whores before
that either me or my boys tore it up before
so i'm hoping you different, let you push the 6 and
give you a different life and baby if it's right
jump on it in the morning and ride it 'til the night
want to buy you ill jewelry when it hits the light
bitches'll momentarily lose they sight
she said


got the bomb place, fireplace john blaze
victoria secret lingerie, ice like don king
the price was like eight digits a long way, shit
got the beachfront view, v-1-2
cop you one, cop me one too
on the place, jet ski's park by the lake
no neighbors, make all the noise you want to make
invite your friends over
let 'em make their way through the benzes and the rovers
before they reach the door
vacay, away a week or more
first class to and fro, freaking off
got the hamptons locked, champagne popped
cruise around the world 'til the damn thing stops
cop rembrandt, hang 'em, paid a lot
can't complain, we balling, true or not, ma?
