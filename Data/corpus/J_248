giuliani's got me and my crimies thinking grimy
can’t hustle no more, got to get this money through muscle for sure
me and my wildlife, youngins running up, gun it up
staked out your money spot, then done it up
with gunplay, you faggots forfeit, "you won jay
just let a nigga live to see his son, someday"
shut up, no compassion, kept blasting
shit, you will never catch me slipping’ sipping mo'
it’ll be no revenge, i tie up all loose ends
strictly business, the worst witnesses is you and your dead friends
i don’t just hit you with nouns, unlike these other rappers
this shit i spit'll make you hit the ground
when i sci-fi ‘kappa kappa’, the step show starts
even in the barbershop, you don’t want no part
nigga
