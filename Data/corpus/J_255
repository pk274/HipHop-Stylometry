(what y'all gon do?) you got starch in your flow
i flow too many ways, got a arch in my flow, all sorts of flow
rembrandt, rilke, i am art with the flow
even if i'm guilty, you gotta pardon the flow
niggas taking it lightly, had to darken the flow
way i put it together, tear 'em apart with the flow
i'm too smart with the flow, you just started the flow
stop it youngin, you 106 & park with the flow
i am pro, as you see, i'm off the charts with the flow
actually i'm number one on the charts with the flow
in some places they say this, i am god with the flow
like my office but they're biased, too involved with the flow
although i am the youth spirit, i am y'all with the flow
troubled man, dare i say, i am mar' with the flow
i come up hard but i evolve with the flow
crossover, slam dunk, rucker park with the flow, let's go
