don't get mad at me
i don't love 'em i fuck 'em
i don't chase 'em i duck 'em
i replace 'em with another one
you had to see she keep calling me big
(and another one!)
and my name is jay-z
she was all on my dick
gradually i'm taking over your bitch
coming over your shit
got my feet up on you sofas, man
i'm eating a hostess from her open hand
you coming home to dishes and empty soda cans
i got your bitch up in my rover, man
i never kiss her, i never hold her hand
in fact i diss her i'm a bolder man
i'mma pimp her; it's over, man
when i twist her in the gold sedan
like i'm goldie man, you're bitch chose man
jigga man, iceberg with the frozen hands
wedding bands don't make it rosy, man
