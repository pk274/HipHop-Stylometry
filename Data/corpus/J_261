man, a nigga once told me like
you never know who your true friends until you ah umm
both got a little bit of money
i mean 'cause y'all both broke
then there's no strain on the relationship, y'all both broke
and if you got money and he ain't got no paper
he still needs you so you'll never know how he really feel about you
when y'all both get some paper, you'll see


we used to get money together, bone honies together
pushin' chromed out twinkies in custom coach leather
you claim it's all love, but nigga it's whatever
'cause this is business, it ain't personal
same dream, same team, same schemes (mm)
we even sold to the same damn fiends (how real is that?)
ain't no rules in this war for this green
this is business, and it ain't personal

look, i'm a grown man dog
and i ain't got time to be runnin' behind y'all
i know when i first started it was crazy to y'all
"he's gon' start his own label, he'll never be able"
well, nigga you've been wrong before
and you'll be wrong again if you bet against him
we move through the hood like identical twins
but it just so happen that a nigga made it rappin'
you showed your true colors, y'all niggas stay yappin'
that don't stop him, a nigga way platinum
stop through the hood, to say what's happenin'? (sup nigga)
fake hugs (uh-huh), fake whassup
fake love, fake fuck, fake thugs
gotta warn myself for your fake shit, i raise up
hop in my wheels and i peel, streets are blazed up (uh-huh)
about my bid'ness dog, y'all niggas stay up - one


a-alike (uh-huh), be alike (that's right)
we don't vibe no more because we don't see alike
and your mom got it twisted, she think hov' changed
nope; hov's still here like rogaine
ask your boy what he did to the whole game
how he jeopardized the whole game
now when we see each other it's so strange
i don't know whether to hug him or slug him (damn)
i don't know whether to cap him or dap him
i don't know what to think of him, i don't know what's happenin'
but what i do know, all the niggas that you know
locked up doin' a few doe, but who knows?
maybe it wasn't you, maybe i'm buggin' too (right)
but i'm scared dog, i don't know what the fuck to do
do me a favor, place yourself in my shoes
the game, no exceptions, gotta follow the rules
