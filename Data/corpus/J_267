bear witness to the greatest, can't beat us, join us
keep heaters on us, with red lasers
now fair warning, sure shots won't graze ya
we hug corners, play blocks like gators
with bundles on us, serve tre's like waiters
it's the life we chose, to hustle
can't stop it, can't knock it
half the profit get flown out vegas
me and my niggas try and break tables
stack chips like connect four
while you pricks try and whip try and stretch more
charge less for, that ain't the program
get ya lessons from the snow man
like pillsbury i get the dough man
i off ya head for a slice of bread
i keep my word and i'm true to my peeps
give me a bird and my crew gon' eat
i'm over the stove like cuban links
breaking down cash money like baby do
you niggas soft like baby food
'round the world niggas pay me dues
while you niggas sing the same old song like sadie do (same song)
grown man nigga, baby who?
i send you shots from the baby zoo

bring the drama to ya lawn nigga
tell ya mama "bye bye" get ready to mourn sister, it's a
see what you got here's a full blown twister, you nuttin' but hot air
it's not fair
the reason why we lead the pack, this is a marathon
you start off fast then you wheezing in the back
so even if i slack, i got enough lee-way
to put out the reason by the mac, philadelphia freeway and i'm back
without leaving i'm here, but you can't see him
i gave you the blueprint but you can't be him
so matter what you been told or the records you sold
deep inside you know that it's only one hov
young vito, voice of the young people
