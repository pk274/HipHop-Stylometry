god in my cells, that's my celly
made in the image of god, that's a selfie
pray five times a day, so many felonies
who gon' post my bail? lord, help me
hol' up, donda, i'm with your baby when i touch back road
told him, "stop all of that red cap, we goin' home"
not me with all of these sins, castin' stones
this might be the return of the throne (throne)
hova and yeezus, like moses and jesus
you are not in control of my thesis
you already know what i think 'bout think pieces
before you ask, he already told you who he think he is
don't try to jail my thoughts and think precincts
i can't be controlled with programs and presets
reset
on my cell, in my cell tonight
don't have to see you to touch you
this is what braille look like, it's on sight
if they take me to jail, call my girl, tell her send my mail
we know what hell look like
still, it's a hell of a life, yikes
