but when the night is coming soon (yeah, yeah, jay)
i'm leaving behind some of the best of what i learned (yes sir)
no matter where they've always done that (nice waterfalls)
no matter what you think they always did right (it's okay)


why must i wait?
for the woman that i love?
why must the words i say be true?
it would help me to know
that love is like a storm
brought on by strong winds
an undertaker living in the night
that puts out the light
i'm looking for love
just like the one you want the most
that's the way it goes
i remember the day you called me
the first thing i put inside my fist
i was lonely, you never put me down
and i've never known a love like you into my heart
it's not the way it seems, and it won't be easy
we're together and nothing's wrong than what we deserve
you came back today and told me you want me too
what if someday, somebody turns me over to you?
i can make your dreams come true
just guess my dear i'll never see the day
i hope someday i'll be yours as one


but when the night is coming soon (yeah, yeah, jay)
i'm leaving behind some of the best of what i learned (yes sir)
no matter where they've always done that (nice waterfalls)
no matter what you think they always did right (it's okay)
