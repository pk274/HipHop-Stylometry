i never thought you were a woman
don't you hear me once again
my tongue don't sin' from heaven
now when you think about it
the church bells no more
the voices that came steal their melody
but you don't know they're gone
we use the bells in our houses
now the traffic has all been cleared out
roadworks in my works
see me trying to hide the tears in my eyes
now the sand is pusher than i was blind
i been chosen by my roots to a graveyard man
they said don't you know i've been back on
to believe that i have this old love
all i think about is making love
all i ever do, is giving love
all i think about is him and her
why you want to be so uptight for me?
a lot of things go up and down the drain
and i think about the time it took to get a gun
why you want to be so uptight for me?
a lot of things are going on for me
no, no, no, i'm not your enemy
it's just that this is the last thing on my mind
no, no, no, no, i'm not your enemy
it's just that this is the last thing on my mind
yeah, yeah i'm not your enemy
a mother told me that it's sad if she had to go
tell me how we can set the record straight
i have been so busy, busy music, good shit
i'm a man who has a mission
i know better than to think that
he can someday change these things
he's got the pieces to make them really happen
there's a station on a new york highway
i want to find out what it is i've lost


come on, come on, come on, come on, come on tonight
come on, come on, come on, come on tonight
come on, come on, come on, come on tonight
come on, come on, come on, come on tonight
