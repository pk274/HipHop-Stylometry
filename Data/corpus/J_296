and now i take you for a walk through the ghetto
half a mill' in the trunk and i ain't moved no llello
born in the ghetto that's why i can't let go
i'm into that i love women exposed
no rick james mayne i was looking for a super freak
super drizzy gudda chuckee twist that's the super clique
ready to quit 'til she met the super pimp
she got that wet-wet now that's a superleak
lyrics for the out click click like shotti's spray
big money for the grill so i'm never cheap talking yea
the rest sellin tapes screwed tryna eat off his fame
he's wears a mask so when he dawns his face
the kevlar isn't a problem i'll just shoot his knees
so get used to it i was through with it, chop
