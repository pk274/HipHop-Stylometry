young! woo! hov'! yes
she wanna meet the only king on the east coast
hook me up witcha boy snoop she said he so low
i never get the chance to get at him
only on the tv when i blow kisses at him, muah
listen here madam, you can throw the pussy at him
if it ain't about snatch, well it just won't happen!
hov ain't into backwards mackin
how backwards that is
i don't love 'em though
'less makin a little paper then i love 'em the most
if she's, sneakin in the club with the toast
i'm flyin the friendly skies with 36 os
shit, i can get a chef to cook for me
talk about some paper if you tryin to book me
ma, you can keep your head
i got, expensive habits that need the bread
