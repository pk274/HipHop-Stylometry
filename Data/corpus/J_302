can i get a small commercial break?
i think it's time for a small commercial break
yeah, uh huh
get up and stretch, i'm ready


lookin' at them s dots, it's about that time
to do michael jordan numbers
the sneaker game is mine
i ain't made 'em for the ball court, i made 'em to shine
so you can score big when you courtin' a dime
when niggas see me, shit, they see the grind
you gotta be blind you only see the shine
i dropped them s dots and in record time
the number one seller since they first design
50-50, you know how i handle mine
a nickel for you, gimme my dime
tell paul fireman i got him on fire, man
he ain't been this hot since a.i. was signed
now a nigga talkin' to kenyon martin
shawn marion, shit i might be startin'
s dot nba niggas
went from bein' in va to signin' nba niggas
i hurdled every hurdle, obtained
every dame that was out of a nigga reach with my figure of speech
open the door for my niggas with me
openin' more for niggas i don't know so all y'all niggas can eat
if it wasn't for s dot...


now back to our regularly scheduled program, l'album noir: the black album
