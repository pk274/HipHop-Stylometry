uh huh uh, geah
roc-a-fella y'all
jigga, rell, '98 edition
this is roc-a-fella for life, this is roc-a-fella for life
uhh, this is roc-a-fella for life, this is roc-a-fella for life


i play my parts with the honies hard
it's gotten even worse now that the money's washed
like a letter y'all, the nine-eight find me straight
good health, can't complain about my financial state
what else? i guess tomorrow knows
i run through chicks like borrowed clothes
i'm the type of nigga your father oppose, never test jay
you follow the code, ese, on my best day
i'm like god with the flow, bless me


yeah yeah yeah
in the sl with rell, music at a high decimal
mami fronting, touching buttons like she spec-ial
'cause she sex well, and the best tail, roc-a-fella cartel
excel-ing like hyundai, sunday to sunday
it's for the nachos, come out the clothes
and baby girl if it's hammer time then hide your toes
the game cold like, five below, but once inside the show
we tore it down; about that money, we throw it around
so when the ice hit the sun rays, run for shade
game's over, we didn't come to play
the fuck y'all thinking?
