i pledge allegiance to my grandma
for that banana pudding, our piece of americana
our apple pie was supplied through arm & hammer
straight out the kitchen, shh, don't wake nana
built a republic that still stands
i'm tryna lead a nation to leave to my little man's
or my daughter, so i'm boiling this water
the scales was lopsided, i'm just restoring order
hold up, here comes grandma, what's up yaya?
what's that smell? oh, i'm just boiling some agua
no papa, bad santa
the streets raised me, pardon my bad manners
i got my liberty chopping grams up
street justice, i pray god understand us
i pledge allegiance to all the scramblers
this is the star-spangled banner
