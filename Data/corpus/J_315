it smell like summertime to me! {"what is this?"}
first one to cop, i'm the maybach muse
first one in the coupe, i'm on my third six-deuce
white guts, black benz
i call that bitch affirmative action
oreo, the obama
curtains drawn, they can't see me, osama
cashmere throws, that's a splash of class
s.c. initials on the tiffany glass
i guess on the initial maybach
i was way too official, they ain't call jay back
i'm just a bully, i apologize
and if you would've asked, i probably would've lied
huh, this better, no pressure
as my mind reclines on white leathers
i think back to my first maybach
baby blue sides, i called her my similac
six-deuce every time, i never had the heinz
fifty-seven can't catch up to mines
no diss to ricky, this his song
but everybody know this the shit that i been on
no fives, no four-point-ohs
so no partitions, a no-no for hov' {"sweet"}
i'm a just a top-drawer nigga
penthouse every time, i'm a top-floor nigga
as i drift off further
chauffeur serves the city, observers
oohs and ahhs, they know who's inside
though i never touch the wheel, i won't lose my drive
oohs and ahhs, they know who's inside
on the factory shoes, i won't lose my stride
this is maybach, bitch!
