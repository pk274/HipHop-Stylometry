it's young!
hahahah, fuck it then


black maybach, white seats, black pipin'
remind me of paul mccartney and mike fightin'
you know, "the girl is mine"
life's a bitch, so the whole world is mine
the six-deuce long, the curtains are drawn
perfectly like a picasso, rembrandts and rothkos
i'm a major player, 40/40's in vegas at the palazzo
they said it was not so
certain things your money can't buy
like being this fly, 'til then, i'm just gon' ride
i'm like g rap with better transportation
on the road to the riches, reach my final destination
in the lear, closer to aaliyah, say a prayer
hope i get to see her when i disappear from here, baby, yeah
but i don't see the endin' through these millionaire lenses
just the two m's on the emblem
the partition roof, translucent and humidor
refrigerators, where ace of spades or two i store
true story, my closet is like two stories
straight to the happy endin', cause i don't do stories
shawn corey, real rap
the maybach is bananasâ€”peel back


hahahah, you feel that? young, c'mon


realest shit i ever wrote, chillin' in my maybach
8-track episodes, been doin' this since way back
since way back, since way back
8-track episodes, been doin' this since way back
realest shit i ever wrote, chillin' in my maybach
8-track episodes, been doin' this since way back
since way back, since way back
8-track episodes, been doin' this since way back
