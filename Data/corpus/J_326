and you pawned all your chains
and they run off with your masters
and took it to beverly hills while we in calabasas
and my head is scratchin' 'cause that shit is backwards
that shit ain't right, lucian is cool
but lucian don't write, doug ain't this tight
so fuck what we sellin', fuck is we makin'?
'cause their grass is greener 'cause they always rakin' in mo'
