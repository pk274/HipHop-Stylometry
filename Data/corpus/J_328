that nigga let his fuckin flow go
niggas tryin to switch up the flows on niggas
hit niggas, slip niggas with a micky
drop that joint
yeah yeah (it's the remix y'all)
like a muh'fucker (oh yeah)
whassup my nigga (and still hot up in that boy, ain't it man)
(yo jay, kell, fin' ta set it off for y'all)
c'mon


gettin this money switchin my whips and my kicks
like i'm just addicted to difference
you pick what you want from me
to be a, lame with visions of riches, enter my brain
like i picture myself in deep dishes, just switchin lanes
it's just insane, is it? i'm from the district where niggas
either in prison or pay visits like in-laws
so we fend for ourself, and the wealth is in raw
we can't help but been lost
what else gon' make that engine roar?
lay back in 745, big boy cars, that's all we drive
into the club we get all the eyes
when you gettin that money, my nigga
