yeah, i got a hublot, i call it tebow
i strap that bitch with a gator band
y'all niggas ball half-time, y'all niggas like the gator band
y'all niggas need a time out
who got these niggas all wound up?
cocksucker, i'm 730
y'all know where y'all niggas gonna wind up?
no more mr. nice guy, hello mr. nice watch
only but a matter of time 'fore i hit y'all niggas with a nice shot
y'all niggas better not call the law
get no blood on my audemar
meaning y'all better not waste my time
when y'all ready i take you all to war
meanwhile i'm just choppin' off doors
put the front on the back, 'cause i'm back and forth
put the front on the back of the 'bach like a boss
so i'm frontin' on niggas when i'm backin' off
uh, what up, cole? it's your time, let's these niggas know
adjust your rollie on these motherfucking hoes
whenever you ready, go
