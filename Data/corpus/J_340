sun in the sky, you know how i feel
breeze driftin' on by
breeze driftin' on by
it's a new life for me, yeah
me and the rza connect
it's a new life for me, ooh
me and the rza connect
and i'm feeling good
yeah


sorry, junior, i already ruined ya
'cause you ain't even alive, paparazzi pursuin' ya
sins of a father make your life ten times harder
i just wanna take ya to a barber
bondin' on charters, all the shit that i never did
teach you good values so you cherish it
took me twenty-six years to find my path
my only job is cut the time in half
so at thirteen, we'll have our first drink together
black bar mitzvahs, mazel tov, mogul talk
look a man dead in his eyes
so he know you talk truth when you speak it
give your word, keep it
and if the day comes i only see him on the weekend
i just pray we was in love on the night that we conceived him
promise to never leave him even if his mama tweakin'
'cause my dad left me and i promise never repeat him
never repeat him, never repeat him
