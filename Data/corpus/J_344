you ain't in it for the money then get out the game
motherfucker's better think before they spit out my name
i've been known to have tone, shit out the frame
load up the clip and aim
listen
you ain't in it for the dough yo
you're rhyming your blah
i hit you with an o you be the crime in your block
if you wanna sell a million motherfuckers then rap
you know we come through with the glaciers
you bladdidy-blah
and our homes be spacious like a mil and dot
in a platinum bracelets try to steal at your shot
been a villian since i can remember four-wheeling the plot
sell crack, make a mil and then stop
feel me?
