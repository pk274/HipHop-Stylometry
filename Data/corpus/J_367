when the war's on, the 4's are drawn like pictures
'til niggas is all gone when these triggers get witcha
niggas before long you need stitches in your long johns
a.k. (t-t-t-t), heartbeat (t-t-t-t)
it figures you fictitious niggas can't stop (that)
jigga, twista, my nigga timb on a hot track
how you gon' stop that? we can't be slowed
niggas throw dog, look at your clothes
when i'm in crazy mode, .380 blow's like
maceo, leave acey holes
that's just jay-z though, crazy flow
rhyme great, dominate your radio
c'mon, get your gun on, your mask and gloves
i don't ask for love, i blast 'em up
respect my gangsta dude, or your life's in danger dude
(doctors pushin' on your chest tryin' to bring you through)
