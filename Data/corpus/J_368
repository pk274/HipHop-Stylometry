its like finding feathers on a housecat
lemme take yall somewhere else right now
it's like searching for a needle in a haystack
lemme get y'all to zone out wit' me, man
(its a'ight, don't be scared)
take y'all niggas left and center (zone out wit')
bullshit


y'all niggas should twist up sumthin
real real real tight right here
zone out wit' ya boy
if you don't smoke, grab you something to drink
mix it up right
if you don't smoke or drink
man, just light up an incense, fuck it
close ya eyes
vibe wit' a nigga
i want y'all to really hear me
