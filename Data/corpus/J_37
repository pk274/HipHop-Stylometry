geah, yeah
life is but a dream to me, i don't wanna wake up
thirty odd years without having my cake up
so i'm about my paper 24/7, 365, 366 in a leap year
i don't know why we here
since we gotta be here life is but a beach ch-ch-ch-chair
went from having shabby clothes, crossing over abbey road
hear my angels singing to me (are you happy, hov?)
i just hope i'm hearing right; karma's got me fearing like
colleek are you praying for me?
see i got demons in my past, so i got daughters on the way
if the prophecy's correct, then the child should have to pay
for the sins of a father, so i barter my tomorrows
against my yesterdays in hopes that she'll be okay
and when i'm no longer here to shade her face from the glare
i'll give her my share of carol's daughter and a new beach chair

life is but a dream to me
gun shots sing to these other guys
but lullabies don't mean a thing to me
i'm not afraid of dying, i'm afraid of not trying
every day, hit every wave like i'm hawaiian
i don't surf the net, no, i never been on myspace
too busy letting my voice vibrate
carving out my space in this world of fly girls
cut-throats and diamond-cut ropes i twirls
benzes 'round corners where the sun don't shine
i let the wheels give a glimpse of hope of one's grind
son said: "hov, how you get so fly?"
i said: "from not being afraid to fall out the sky"
my physical's a shell, so when i say farewell
my soul will find a even higher plane to dwell
so fly, you shall, so have no fear
just know that life is but a beach chair


i hear my angels sing...
life is just a dream and you really don't wanna wake up, wake up
(i hear my angels sing)
life is just a dream and you really don't wanna leave
life is but a dream
(i hear my angels sing)
life is just a dream and you really don't wanna wake up, wake up
(i hear my angels sing)
life is just a dream and you really don't wanna leave
life is but a dream


life is but a dream
can't mimic my life, i'm the thinnest cut slice
intercut, the winner's cup
with winters rough enough to interrupt life
that's why i'm both saint and sinner, nice
this is jay everyday, no compromise
no compass comes with this life, just eyes
so to map it out, you must look inside
sure, books could guide you, but your heart defines you, chica
your corazón is what brought us home
in great shape like heidi klum, maricón
i am on permanent vacay, life is but a beach chair
this song's like a hallmark card until you reach here
so 'til she's here, and she's declared
the heir, i will prepare
a blueprint for you to print, a map for you to get back
a guide for your eyes; and so you won't lose scent
i'll make a stink for you to think i ink these verses full of prose
so you won't get conned out of two cent
my last will and testament: i leave my heir
my share of roc-a-fella records and a shiny new beach chair


i hear my angels sing...
life is just a dream and you really don't wanna wake up, wake up
life is just a dream and you really don't wanna leave
life is but a dream
(i hear my angels sing)
life is just a dream and you really don't wanna wake up, wake up
life is just a dream and you really don't wanna leave
life is but a dream
life is just a dream and you really don't wanna wake up, wake up
life is just a dream and you really don't wanna leave
life is but a dream
life is just a dream and you really don't wanna wake up, wake up
life is just a dream and you really don't wanna leave
life is but a dream
