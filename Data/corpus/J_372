ninety-nine problems, but a bitch ain't one
if you havin' girl problems, i feel bad for you, son
i got ninety-nine problems, but a bitch ain't one, c'mon


now the year is ninety-four, in my trunk is raw
in the rear view mirror is the motherfuckin' law
i got two choices, y'all: pull over the car or
bounce on the devil, put the pedal to the floor (c'mon)
and i ain't tryin' to see no highway chase with jake
plus i got a few dollars, i can fight the case
so i pull over to the side of the road
i heard, "son, do you know what i'm stoppin' you for?"
'cause i'm young and i'm black and my hat's real low
do i look like a mind reader, sir? i don't know
am i under arrest or should i guess some more?
"you was doin' fifty-five in a fifty-four
license and registration and step out of the car
are you carryin' a weapon on you? know a lot of you are"
i ain't steppin' out of shit, all my paper legit
"well, do you mind if i look around the car a little bit?"
well, my glove compartment is locked, so is the trunk in the back
and i know my rights, so you gon' need a warrant for that
"aren't you sharp as a tack?
you some type of lawyer or somethin'?
somebody important or somethin'?"
ha, i ain't passed the bar, but i know a little bit
enough that you won't illegally search my shit
"well, we'll see how smart you are when the canines come"
i got ninety-nine problems, but a bitch ain't one—hit me!

now once upon a time, not too long ago
a nigga like myself had to strong-arm a ho
this is not a ho in the sense of havin' a pussy
but a pussy havin' no goddamn sense, try and push me
i try to ignore him, talk to the lord
pray for him, but some fools just love to perform
you know the type, loud as a motorbike
but wouldn't bust a grape in a fruit fight
and only thing that's gon' happen is i'ma get to clappin' and
he and his boys gon' be yappin' to the captain
and there i go, trapped in the kit-kat again
back through the system with the riff-raff again
fiends on the floor, scratchin' again
paparazzis with they cameras, snappin' them
d.a. try to give a nigga shaft again
half a mill' for bail 'cause i'm african
all because this fool was harassin' them
tryin' to play the boy like he's saccharine
but ain't nothin' sweet 'bout how i hold my gun
i got ninety-nine problems, bein' a bitch ain't one


ninety-nine problems, but a bitch ain't one
if you havin' girl problems, i feel bad for you, son
i got ninety-nine problems, but a bitch ain't one—hit me!
ninety-nine problems, but a bitch ain't one
if you havin' girl problems, i feel bad for you, son
i got ninety-nine problems, but a bitch ain't one - hit me!


everything you say to me
i got ninety-nine problems, but a bitch ain't one—hit me!
i need a little room to breathe
i got ninety-nine problems, but a bitch ain't one—hit me!
everything you say to me
i got ninety-nine problems, but a bitch ain't one—hit me!
i need a little room to breathe
i got ninety-nine problems
