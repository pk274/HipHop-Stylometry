and we gon' stay hustlin' on that block until we caught (caught, ugh)

we arose, let's go


"so fresh, so clean" like 'kast
jay-z be poppin' tags
leavin' the mall with heavy bags
you know the boy got a love for the cash
"aw, fuck, there he go again
talkin' 'bout hoes and dough again"â€”yup!
can't hold it in
i'm surprised i got so much dough to spend
but back when i was poorer then
you wasn't focusing about the dough i spend
but i was holdin' then, i was a roller then
i was a baller back then, all of that, man
fall back, i bought that
what would you do if you was in my shoes?
leave dudes in the rearview
v12 engine, corners spinning
twinkies shinin', pinky ring
armadale, nigga, stinky-stink
top down, my cash is up
gold chain, i don't give a fuck
gold brain'll get you in the truck, ma
that's right, you in luck, ma
you see me cruisin' down, better step inside
ain't enough room to fit you all in the ride
first-come, first-served basis
you know hov' be goin' to nice places
that's right, and i'm droppin' cash
leave the mall with garbage bags
gucci this, prada that
roll with your boy, you'll be poppin' tags
