as a youth explosively, clappin' off the roof
shootin' guard like kobe, raised up slay smears and bo'e
back then, gil was my co-d
spanish jose showed me how to get the money niggas owed me
fast-forward: no kids, six cars, and three rollies
two cribs, trips to cuba, sippin' on ooba
got rap in a stupor, first to clap your group up
from the range with the ski rack, or six with the roof up
shit, i light the motherfuckin' soundproof booth up
new shit, y'all say the same shit like you're looped up
your raps all lazy, jigga the black scorsese
what your album lack is more jay-z
code name: jay-hova—all praise me
y'all don't paint pictures, you all trace me
you've yet to see the day when my squad be done
i represent that shit nigga—marcy son, what!
