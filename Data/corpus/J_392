now put your sets in the air if you represent your clique
money in the air if you ever hit a lick, baby
put your hands in the air if you know that you that bitch
say you looking for the real? hey, well this is real as it gets
hey, hey, ohh, ohh (wassup, wassup)
hey, hey, ohh, ohh (wassup, wassup, this is real as it gets)
hey, hey, ohh, ohh (wassup, wassup)
hey, hey, ohh, ohh (i got it jeezy, this is real as it gets)


now where that southside at? wassup, wassup
where the west coast at? put your w's up
where my east coast niggas that hustle to live
and all my niggas up north that's doin' a bid?
oh yeah i'm rare, i'm aware that i'm rare
i rap and i’m real, i'm one of the few here
these other boys lyin', i wonder if y'all care
they stories out this world, i wonder if y'all hear
but don't really matter as long as they stay clear
clear of the real shit we doin' over here
when my nigga get home, i'm gon' send him a lear
for all the time he been down, get him right up in the air
with a couple of broads, get him right up in the air
mile high club, get him right up in there
send my nigga some gear like he never missed a year
by the time you hear this song, he'll be standin' right here
real nigga shit there


a hundred million to the good and i'm still talkin' yayo
at a snail's pace, i won this race that y’all trail
uh, uh, blueprint's for sale
followin' my footprints you can't fail
set sail, i used to duck shots but now i eat quail
i'll probably never see jail
each tale contains more of the truth
of the statute allows me to go into detail
uh, close your eyes, you can smell
hov's the audio equivalent of braille
that's why they feel me in the favelas in brazil
and waterhouse 'cause real recognize real
rrrah!
