s dot's taking off, g-iv's about to land
see how we cross brand, we boss about it, man
got the sole of the old guccis, if you upset sue me
if not sit back and watch me do me
parking lot pimpin', sideline ballers
we don't sweat up the fresh, let the girls do it for us
the watch talk for me, drop talk for he
brand new s dots, walk with me
sort of like you just scored a bucket
you bowlegged, you frontin', you walkin' awkwardly
ho, it's nothing keep score with me
give me three hot seconds, i'll break reebok records
