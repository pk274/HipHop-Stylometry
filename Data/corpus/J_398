i don't give a fuck who you are, so fuck who you are
i don't care about a pretty bitch, watch or a car
i don't care about your block and whoever you shot
i don't care about your album and whenever it drop
i don't care about your past if i did i woulda asked
i'm too busy lighting 'dro with a whole lotta hash
far as this rap shit, i'm ten steps ahead of niggas
shooting backwards, just for practice
ride or die nigga, hopping in your casket
'bout to go to hell with you, blow the l with you
tell the whole world i'm spitting, let 'em know the shells hit you
i tell niggas quick, suck dick and get a glock
my name ring bells like sunday at twelve o'clock
i'm half past seven, bust six then eleven
you know me, slide my man my joint say reload me
i ruff ryde and pop a fella for roc-a-fella
screaming (what the fuck), spending mozzarella


i know pop you can't stand us 'cause we cock them hammers
run in your crib, no prisoners, pop your grandma
locked in the slammer? nope, popped up in atlanta
crossed up in a drop, i popped up the antenna
whoa.. watch your manners when my veins pop like scanners
like raindrops you hear the thunder when i cock the cannon
big thang, big chains, ain't shit changed
get brain in the four dot six range
shit mayne, switch lanes
every town i hit, switch planes, bitch, flip big 'caine
flow with no cut, you take it in vein to the brain
muh'fuckas is nodding and throwing up, you know that
you don't wanna owe that man
he'll hit you, get the picture? kodak, man
gotta, love for war, i don't floss no more
i just sit on my money 'til i'm above the law
how the fuck you gon' stop us with your measly asses?
we don't stop at the tolls, we got e-zpasses, nigga
multiple cars and divas with d-classes
iceberg sweats with i.b. on the elastic
shit, beatch! what the fuck, ya heard me? hahahaha
put some more beat on that joint
