i'm up and do not to you anymore (ayy, ayy)
well darlin', throw away your time (don't throw away...)
forget your friends, i won't throw you down (down, down)
oh, you're always around the share (yeah, share)
you smile and tell me you love me (don't go away)
you're telling me that i am strong (yeah, yeah, yeah)
don't put your hand in my back pocket (pocket)
you don't put my hand in my engine (yeah, ahh!)
i don't love you, i don't need your hurtin' (mhm, yeah)
i'd be your engine, you'd be my gun
