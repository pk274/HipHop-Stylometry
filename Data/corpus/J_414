ummmmmmmmm, i don't mean no harm
but your boy got the magic stick, the don juan
bishop, chicks'll disappear in thin air
like mist or some shit like this i swear
i take handcuffs off missus, i pick locks wicked
i catch your eye 'cause my tick-tock's frigid
my necklace glisten, all reckless chicks is
eyeballin', yeah, and i caught 'em like perfect pitches
call me mike piazza
once i get 'em in, my fly casa
it's hot tubs, heated pools and no rules
call your old dude and tell him he old news
tell that fella you feel like cinderella
with both shoes and it's almost two
fuck a storybook endin', we bendin' the rules
this is somebody's girl part two, ooh


the moral of the tale, if you love your tail
treat her well, keep her 'way from hov' and kel'
because we can't stop pimpin
we put it on her 'til she can't stop limpin
she'll be a goner, you can play tough guy in the corner
i smooth her out in the sauna
yeah, i blew it out in the bahamas, yeah
your lil' mama got her stella on
we got it on like a telethon
mr. roc-a-fella, gone
