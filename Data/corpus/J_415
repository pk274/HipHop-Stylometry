in this manila envelope, the results of my insanity
quack said i crossed the line 'tween real life and fantasy
can it be the same one on covers with warren buffett?
was ducking the undercovers, was warring with muh'fuckers
went from warring to warren, undercovers to covers
if you believe in that sort of luck, your screws need adjusting
in the world of no justice and black ladies on the back of buses
i'm the immaculate conception of rappers-slash-hustlers
my god, it's so hard to conceive
but it all falls perfect, i'm like autumn is to trees
aw, the doc interrupted
he scribbled a prescription for some prozac, he said, "take that for your mustard
boy, you must be off your rocker
if you think you'll make it off the strip before they 'pac ya
nigga, you gotta be psychotic or mixing something potent with your vodka
it takes a lot to shock us but you being so prosperous is preposterous
how could this nappy-headed boy from out the projects
be the apple of america's obsession?
you totally disconnected with reality, don't believe in dreams
since when did black men become kings?"
