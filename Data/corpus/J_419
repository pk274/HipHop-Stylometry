catch up, niggas


damn you fadin' 'em hov', how you gave 'em that?
audemar piguet with the alligator strap
sick of y'all niggas with ya now and later raps
rap about it now, hope you get it later
do a couple shows, hope you niggas is savin' up
(i show you how to do this son)
but this particular watch be a one of one
that means none before it, none to come
the homie that's rappin' be the only one that has it
(i show you how to do this son)
you ain't heard? i push the six when the fives is out
you can't fight me, in the porsche i'll box you out
(i show you how to do this son)
we don't drive x5s we give 'em to baby-mammas
push the big top that shaped like a kansas chicken snack box
i get it crackin' when i'm backin' out the garage
a 360 drop ferrar', shutdown manhattan
bucket low, like fuck it, though
nikes on, daytime, lights on, hell yeah i'm frontin' but you love it, though
(i show you how to do this son)
nigga i'm a check writer, you're royalty receivers
y'all eatin' off per diem, on the low like a caesar
pay ya taxes, y'all niggas hustlin' backwards
i cop and crash whips, jay is a bastard
(i show you how to do this son)
how you want it, my jeans is 300
these ain't diesel, nigga, these is evisu
top is roc, you know the rest
a big bucket of frozen water on my chest
(i show you how to do this son)
listen man, get a crate, some crack, and some house slippers
a newspaper, look out boy, and get ya chips up
or get a gun, a mask, an escape route
some ducktape'll make 'em take you to the house
and ma don't give him nothin', unless he's treatin' you special
soon he'll get desperate, and go down and bless you
and when he come up for air, with a mouth full of hair
just grab your coach bag and get the fuck outta there, yeah
(i show you how to do this hon)
look, think big, fuck gettin' your nails done
think cars, cribs, jewels, some shit for your son
don't let 'em give you, hard dick and bubble gum
make him cop the lex bubble, 2001 hon
(i show you how to do this hon)
and if your man got you baggin' up, it could be worse
just put a little in the baggy, put a little in the purse
