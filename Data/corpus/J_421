uh, check
i live the single life but only for tonight
so when the sun rise, come rise up out my sight
know you like the family room, table lookin like ice
elevator in the crib, we shot up one flight
then i sexed her, by the wet bar, left her ass wet
found az yet and popped in the cass-ette
dim the lights time to please ya, ma
when ya flee could you try not to leave your bra
changed the sheets so wife won't fine no hair on the pillow
cause if it ain't her regular color, oh brother
ya'll ain't seen drama till you seen my little mama, spazzed out
she like to fight till she pass out
so don't catch feelings, in the morning, you're gone
wifey's off tonight but tomorrow she's back on
it's iceberg baby, the mack was born
roll around, you can feel where the mattress worn
and that's new, you seen the thin line, well that's you
cause that's what i do, all day
get down like dee brown, i wanna rock you
on and on like erykah badu, damn ya feel that?
