please believe that, some how, some way
we gotta make it up out the hood some day
some how, some way
we gotta make it up out this life, c'mon
some how, some way
we gotta make it up out the hood some day
some way
we gotta make it up out this life


whether we dribble out this motherfucker
rap metaphors and riddle out this motherfucker
work second floors, hospital out this motherfucker
some how we gotta get up out this motherfucker
some day the cops'll kill a muh'fucker
i don't always wanna be this drug dealing muh'fucker, damn
wish i could take us all
on this magic carpet ride through the sky
i, used to play the hall and fifth floor
me and my boys, we all poor, getting high
i, seen the worst of the worst
i deserve every blessing i received, i'm from the dirt
i, planted my seed on unfertile land
myrtle park, marcy, flushing and nostrand
and, still i grew
some how i knew that the sun'll shine through and
touch my soul, take hold of my hand
look man, a tree grows in brooklyn


some how, some way
i gotta make it up out the hood someday
some how, some way
i gotta make it up out this life, c'mon
some way
i gotta make it up out this hood some day


some how, some way
we gotta make it up out the hood some day
some how, some way
we gotta make it up out this life, c'mon
some how, some way
we gotta make it up out the hood some day
some way
we gotta make it up out this life
