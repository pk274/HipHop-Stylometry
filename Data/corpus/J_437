i think you misunderstood me the first time...
listen, that was my hurt in my heart talking, along with the truth
i would thirst often as a youth, 'cause of you the person
mom's nursing self-esteem issues
round the house it's hard to find a clean tissue, minus her tears
to rewind this time i promise i'd minus my years
to the day to take the pain away
seemed sunny outside, always rained on jay
pop you my umbrella, come help your son with the weather
soon we come together like man and man and build
play spades, cards face up, i've come to deal
in order to get right we gotta deal with this wrong
and the pain i felt all my life you feel in the song
your lack of warmth left a chill in the morn'
your lack of love left me loveless, and i'm of your breath
i'm your mind, body, and soul, your heart, your flesh
your alcohol, your smoke, it results i'm a mess
and dad, still i love you no less dad
hope you didn't think success would make me less mad
but not mad, just disappointed, we wasted years
i swear to god, may you take me away from here
if you taught me anything
the one thing you taught me is to face my fears, coward
how could you let me grow without you?
grind in this rap game, take dough without you?
wear my pro-keds close to the sole without you?
family pictures pose without you
why?! why shouldn't i be mad?
monster's parents separated, monster had his dad
b's parents had they problems, he still came to the pad
he bought 'em new bikes, imagine what that felt like
used to have to bump my head to go to sleep at night
nigga you did me wrong but the love is strong
let's move on
