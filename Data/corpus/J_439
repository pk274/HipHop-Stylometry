somebody 'gon drop!
oh, oh! - ya'll hear me though...
i cannot stop!
i will not stop!
as we proceed!


young hov got the game in a frenzy
twenty million sold all independently
so when you mention me
make sure you got together your 'semblies
like "he's the games j.f.kennedy"
i started out i ain't have no chimney
my ma was santa claus, well at least she pretended to be
'til one night, well that's if memory serves me correct i caught her under
the christmas tree
young hov ain't have no pops
thank god man i had the block
ya'll hear me though
you young fucks got the game all wrong
this is my life man this ain't no song
you ain't livin' your rhymes out, you live at your mom's house
in that tight-ass room, pullin' the cars out
and the mirror pointin' at your reflection, killing yourself
you american pie, stop feeling yourself
nigga, you just a worker, go deal yourself
stop being a server, get a meal yourself
where your heart at, all that yick-yack, ain't nobody scared of your gats
we got bigger ones
how many niggas done shot at me shivering
they were so scared they ain't hit me once
young hov 'bout to go to the range
'bout to work on perfecting my aim


ya'll hear me though...
stop!
i cannot stop!
uh, uh! - ya'll hear me though...
i cannot stop!
i will not stop!
as we proceed!
