fo' sure, everythings for dough now
flow, you gotta pay a little more now
it's platinum, now a days we put the gold down
we stepped it up, y'all don't ever want a showdown
get wetted up by the sleeve that leave the bezel out
y'all don't like it? sue me, fuck i'll settle out
ghetto'd out in the vehicle bent
these days i mellowed out, see success make a fella content
uh-huh, you know, this rap star, papi chulo
jay-z, hugo, of course player you lost player
i know you rappers wanna see me fail
but quick to see a 600sel v-12
live wit it, y'all got dough to get get it
i got mine, your little bit of money couldn't stop mine
your block time, too hot, too many hands in your pie
seventy thirty, the nigga you work for work for me
bottom line


people know me on these streets and the towns i been through
lookin at me, stay focused, i'm givin em straight poker suprise
what i do is already legalized
analyze how i floss of course, ain't no love lost
