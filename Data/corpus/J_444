brothers can beg and borrow
still feel sorrow
when jay
z like zorro get in that ass
better luck tomorrow
i'm too much, nigga, so never should you rush
you need slow down, or get your ass tore down
check it out, i'm too cocky
to stop me, you gotta kill me
and when i'm gone, you can still feel me
on the real, b
the shit is eternal, i rock the heavens well
even if they won't let me in heaven
i raise hell, till its heaven
recognize, the black cat with the nine lives
get up off me, nigga, its bad luck to cross me
i'm poppin crystal, shooting game like missiles
as projected, all ho's affected by this style
i mack like goldie, go back like the oldies
but the goody, pulling r&b bitches wearing hoodies
they don't be knowing the way i be flowing
when i be going
i be running the track like jesse owens
i disrupt the natural scheme
the way that you do things wit a swing and have em rocking like
you say never you run, if ever you come
it's never you run so fast in your life to never have won
come on and ride the rhythm
i be producing like jizm
just like the gods i start with knowledge and follow with wisdom
for greater understanding
i'm landing blows and
knocking sense into those that oppose me, ha
enticin when slicing through tracks
you're screaming, "jesus christ," he's back
and god knows he can rap
me and l put rhythm on the map
so give him his dap
and me, i just take mine
gimme those, gimme this, gimme that, fuck that
you never see me stressed, in a gs
on the prize, my greedy eyes can't see no less
jigga incredible
even my thoughts is federal
like kidnapping, extortion and corruption
so you know, beatin me will never come
like a nun or tomorrow, i'm too thorough, nigga
i make moves, cause bowels to move
when i'm creeping through your hood with a thousand little dudes
armed with the peace like islam
i make your eyes rise like yeast
surprise, i feel no fear when facing y'all
betcha lyrics jump off the track like racing cars
emcee's trying to be the best
and even in dying, couldn't be this def
i see no reason to stop cheesin
ever since l said "throw three gs in"
and we can get down and split the wealth
that's when i found i could do it myself
i get up
