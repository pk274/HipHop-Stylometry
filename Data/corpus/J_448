let's make love in the summertime, yeah
on the sands, beach sands, make plans
to be in each other's arms, yeah
let it breathe, let it breathe
i wanna drown in the depths of you, yeah, yeah
when the water's so blue (so blue, so blue)
so blue (so blue)
i need to take my time, oh yeah
show you somethin' real (so real)
so real (let it breathe), so real (let it breathe, so real)
i want you to come inside right now
so you know just how i feel
how i feel (let it breathe, let it breathe), yeah


let's make love in the summertime, yeah
on the sands, beach sands, make plans
to be in each other's arms
let it breathe, let it breathe
i wanna drown in the depths of you, yeah, yeah (yeah, yeah)
where the water's so blue
so blue (so blue)


i brought my sand to the beach
hopped out the lam' with the sheep
skin rugs on the floor
we hugged, made love on the seats
we tried to hide in the hills
we watched the sky turn peach
summer's light like, summer's night
it's like, christ masterpiece
she taste like corona light, sweet
even the lime gotta squeeze
she gave me a lil' swig, to chase behind my weed
if i can stay in her hair forever, that'd be fine by me
i don't have no concept of time
even with a rose gold concept on me
i remember summer nights in the projects
bullet rounds interrupting my chi
when the worst thing that could happen
zipped up his jacket and ran back down the street
in bel-air, only the nights get cold
i wrapped a yellow jacket 'round bey
it's not lost on me, music has my kids sound asleep


oh, let's make love in the summertime, yeah
on the sands, beach sands, make plans
to be in each other's arms, yeah
let it breathe, let it breathe
i need to take my time to show you somethin' real (so real)
this is real (so real)
i want you to come inside right now
so you know just how i feel, how i feel
let's make love in the summertime
let's make love in the summertime
be in each other's arms
let it breathe, let it breathe
let's make love in the summertime, yeah
on the sands, beach sands, make plans
to love in each other's arms, yeah
