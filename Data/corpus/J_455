uh, uhh uhh, kel's
young, m, ex, tra, money, let's go


she get it from her momma
you can't tie a sweater over that ass, or hide it in pajamas
we lay back, blowin' ganja
dvd, she make it hard to watch a flat tv - whoa!
i crept up behind her
mami threw it like a quarterback, i caught that like rice
i call mami montana, bandana
tied her hands up - this is gangsta love
threw on a rap cd, we gangsta fucked
this ain't r&b smooth, i ain't a r&b dude
poured a glass of army, got mami in the mood
then she stripped for me like the "moulin rouge"
i think i might wife her
y'know, powder blue rocawear suit, white nike her
add mami to the cypher
r-o-c for life cuz, the gang, motherfucker


uhh, yeah
mami shot through the pad with the mark jacobs bag
the thick stitched seam and her favorite ass jeans
y'all know the first date wearers
to make objects bigger than they appear like a rear view mirror
oh, her shoe game is real
she gave 'em the christian louboutin's with the four inch heels
but honestly my favorite type of gear
is a scrungy for her hair and lapearla underwear, clear?
