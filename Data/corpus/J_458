yo, get close enough to hov, smell like a kilo still (still)
first album at 26, i ain't need no deal (real)
already a hood legend, i ain't need no shyne (woo)
first rollie flooded out, i ain't see no time, woah
stand-up niggas, we only duckin' indictments
dope boys, off-white, lookin' like soft white on 'em
heh, you know what i'm sayin'?
we in the buildin', we came for a billion, ain't nobody playin'
live every word that i'm rappin'
say i lost 90 bricks and it happened
you probably wouldn't believe
everything that you seein' right now if it wasn't live action
i ain't on the 'gram, they record who i am
god to these dope boys, how do you not be a hov fan?
i'm what meech shoulda been
i'm what supreme didn't become
if alpo didn't snitch, niggas'd be like young
i got your president tweetin', i won't even meet with him
y'all killed x and let zimmerman live, shhh, s-streets is done
