i know you heard i'm a gangsta
they say, "stay away from them gangstas"
they never change up or pull they pants up
well, baby girl, put ya foot down
don't let 'em push you around
you know what you like
baby thug, you know wrong from right
and you done felt wrong before
this can't be what it feel like
and they don't really know what you feel like, for instance
they don't know the difference between real life
and the music videos and the raggedy magazines
they have it **** badder than he seems
all they see is my baggy jeans, my attitude
i ain't mad at you, it's just my glide (ooh)
way i wear my hat to the side (woo, woo)
the way i lean real low when i ride
that's why in my mind
they like my walk (my walk)
my accent from new york
my way of thinking is slightly off
they like the way he floss
leave the block on a bike, he come back in a porsche
but of course
but most of all, they like my honesty
integrity, my loyalty
young hova and the letter b
