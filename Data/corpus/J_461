go harder than a nigga for a nigga, go figure
told me keep my own money if we ever did split up
how could somethin' so gangster be so pretty in pictures?
ripped jeans and a blazer and some louboutin slippers
uh, picasso was alive, he would've made her
that's right, nigga, mona lisa can't fade her
i mean marilyn monroe, she's quite nice
but why all the pretty icons always all white?
put some colored girls in the moma
half these broads ain't got nothing on willona
don't make me bring thelma in it
bring halle, bring penélope and salma in it, uh
back to my beyoncés
you deserve three stacks, word to andré
call larry gagosian, you belong in mo-seums
you belong in vintage clothes, crushing the whole building
you belong with niggas who used to be known for dope dealing
you too dope for any of those civilians
now shoo, children, stop looking at her tits
get your own dog, ya heard? that's my bitch
