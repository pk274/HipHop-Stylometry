 :
product of determination
one who made it through like the sperm who made him
i represent strength like the black mom who didn't terminate him
but in turn gave him her all
now discussing barbershop back rooms
online chat rooms and on the bathroom on the wall
recall
i came from the bottom but the talent god gave him got him by
y'all can hate him but that only made him stronger than

i'm ready
lookin' at them s. dots it's about that time
to do michael jordan numbers, the sneaker game is mine
i didn't make 'em for the ball court i made 'em to shine
so you can score big when you courtin' a dime
when niggas see me, shit they see the grind
you gotta be blind, you only see the shine
i dropped them s. dots and in record time
the number one seller since they first design
50/50 you know how i handle mine
a nickle for you, give me my dime
tell paul fireman, i got 'em on fire man
he ain't been this hot since a.i. was signed
now a nigga talkin' to kenyon martin
shawn marion, shit i might be startin'
s dot nba niggas
went from being in va to signing nba niggas
i hurdled every hurdle
every nigga that was out of a nigga's reach with my figure of speech
open the door, with my niggas with me
open it more for niggas i don't know
