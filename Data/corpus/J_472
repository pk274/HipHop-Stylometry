wreckin and wreckin in seconds less than speeds of light
so the miggeda-more that come, the miggeda-merrier, right, right
excitin the mic much to the delight of millions of nubians
and amorites just can't understand the groove we're in
cool, it might take a couple of takes for you to clarify
don't lie, you coulda never got in on the first try
but never to worry, i'm not in a hurry, take your time
cause it's my rhyme, i siggeda-said so, and i'm j-a-y-z, y'all know me
i wish you co-write, cause you'd pay me all the rhymes you stole from me
leave you freeze in a minute, you gotta get in it breathin
only when it lets, no sweat, i stutter-step with ease, and
stop fakin, you're makin it, son
i'm breakin and breakin and breakin your tongue
don't get caught perpetratin the cool ones
figure we're bigger and badder and better, and baby, let's face it
we bring havoc, flowin faster than rabbits, try to race it
the lyrical miracle writer, flippin until it drives you
crazy, seek spiritual help from jaz and jay z
standin in awe, you saw the best of em all, the rest will fall
requestin for more, jaws stuck on the floor
these lyrics i pour, we saw, because we're greater
and we are the thiggida-thiggida-thiggida-the (the) originators
word

(cure the blackman
and bring him back to the way he was
in his original state)
