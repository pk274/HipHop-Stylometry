peep the scene
me and the shorty on the slide off
pop the top off the st. ides
she type lady-like
i hit her with ice
sip this in your glass as she sat with class
legs crossed in my living room, radio on blast
she said "you're known for poppin’ styles with the best of us"
i told her with no particular flow i'm ambidextrous
long as the beats are knockin'
we can take it to the "sunshine" or the "streets is watching"
stay pretty, it get gritty
noddin’ the head in agreement, sippin' st. ides through a straw
the crooked letter had the game flowin' like never before
aye-yo, here's the recipe, cop the s.t
play the lo with something sexy and let it flow
uh
