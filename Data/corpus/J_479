dear god.. how can i explain myself?
oh god bless me indeed
when i'm so confused
enlarge my territory
place your love and protection over me at all times
uh, help me!
keep me away from evil
somebody answer me! {*echoes*}
allow me not to cause pain


police in the background, screamin' put the thing down
that's how hard i was tryin' to put my thing down
si-rens ringin' out, old ladies screamin' out
all this attention for me and i'm barely sixteen now
.. it's feelin' like a dream now
handcuffed, roughed up, i'm tossed in the bing now
i'm lyin' next to fiends now, that's the end of the story
let me bring y'all niggas back to the very first scene now
december 4th, a child is born
before i knew it, had my pops trousers on
that's how we do it when the man of the house is gone
you either, stand or fall, i chose to stand
the hawk outside, so i blow my hand
it's a cold cold world but i overstand
tryin' to stay focused but i feel hopeless damn
can't cope with bein' broke, i'm a man - c'mon


now the only thing left is more spirit to roam free
.. 'cause ain't no goin' home for me
it's a cold cold world but i blew my hand
i drew first 'cause i knew that man
i knew what he would do if i didn't draw first
and i couldn't stand the thought of my momma steppin' foot inside a church
all i try to do is try to get up out the dirt
guess he's tryin' to do the same, told me get up out his turf
i wanted to talk to him, but that shit'd never work
we was cut from the same cloth and what was under his shirt was his
momma's rent, his young brother's clothes
my nephew's food, and with that i sqooze
.. and with that i froze
now my life is frozen in time behind these iron poles
and this story is told, for young soldiers
who never choose the life we chose
