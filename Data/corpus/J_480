jeah, ugh
shit i do for a livin', nigga
shit i eat for a livin', nigga (the watcher!)
that's how i live for a livin', nigga
i'm watching
'kay, let's do this
the watcher!


things just ain't the same for gangstas
but i'm a lil' too famous to shoot these pranksters
all of these rap singers claiming they bangers
doing all sorts of twisted shit with they fingers
disrespectin' the game, no home training or manners
i was doing this shit when you was shitting in pampers
i was moving them grams 'fore you knew what a hand-to-hand was
ducking the vans, radars and scanners
before you knew what hard white or tan was
i was hitting the turnpike, aight with the bammers
i was nice with my hands cause i'm hype with them hammers
i was pricking my finger 'fore you knew what a fam' was
i had it laid out 'fore you knew what a plan was
three hundred mil' later—now you understand us
y'all ain't see us coming through vegas
you ever seen so much cham' bust in one night?
grand, fucked up one fight
i was on the peter pan bus
you was putting peter pan up in your room
y'all fuckin' with whom? allow me to retort
you cowards is just now learnin' the shit that we taught
you niggas ain't know about a robb report
'bout a high-speed porsche
i.e., you niggas ain't know how to floss
'til i came through the door like "eric b. for prez"
respect me in this bitch!
you can't disrespect us ‘cause you got a little check cut
you was sucking 'em so long, fucking your lil' neck up
now you too big for your britches, you got a few little bitches
you think you hugh hef', but you just ridiculous
i blew breath for you midgets, i gave life to the game
it's only right i got the right to be king
niggas that got life really like what i sing
‘cause they know it's really like, niggas feel my pain
know the shit i don't write
be the illest shit that's ever been recited in the game
word to the hyphen in my name!
j-a-y, dash, hoffa
the past, present, nigga, the future, proper
the holy trinity in hip-hop is us
we give dre his props, but that's where it stops
it's the roc!

i'm watching, the watcher
bah, bah, the watcher
