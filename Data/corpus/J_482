hol' up, you ain't got love for me, my nigga?
ever meet another nigga like me, my nigga?
are you sure? a nigga flip this shit like jarl borg
a nigga did this shit, this hardcore
if you say it, guess it's true though, kudos, i mean but who knows?
salute to all the real niggas out there findin' the loopholes
fuck all these fuck niggas, hate when niggas come up, igh!
hopped off the plane, hit the helicopter (igh!)
tell these crabs in the barrel we eatin' hella lobster (igh!)
got hella options, like a college team
hit these bootleg niggas with the heisman
fuck the ncaa, nigga
let a young nigga get paid, nigga
niggas talkin' down on the crown
watch them niggas you 'round got you wound
haters wanna ball, let me tighten up my draw string
wrong sport, boy, you know you soft as a lacrosse team
rrraaaahhh
