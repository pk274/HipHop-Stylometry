so i'm the bad guy now i hear, because i don’t go with the flow
don’t ever go with the flow, be the flow
and i don’t need no middle man to talk to my niggas
i understand if you don’t understand, i figure i’m jigga
that’s where we differ
i take what’s mine, you accept what they they give you, i get you
i don’t take no checks i take my respect
pharrell even told me go with the safest bet
jimmy iovine offered a safety net
google dangled around a crazy check
i feel like youtube is the biggest culprit
them niggas pay you a tenth of what you supposed to get
you know niggas die for equal pay right?
you know when i work i ain't your slave right?
you know i ain't shucking and jiving and high fiving
you know this ain't back in the days right?
but i can't tell, like the way they killed freddie gray right
shot down mike brown how they did tray right?
let them continue choking niggas
we gonna turn style, i ain't your token nigga
you know i came in this game independent right?
tidal, my own label, same difference
oh niggas is skeptical as their own shit
you bought 9 iphones and steve jobs is rich
phil knight worth trillions you still bought those kicks
spotify is 9 billion they ain't say shit
lucy you got some 'splaining to do
the only one they hating on look the same as you
i know they trying to bamboozle you
spending millions on media trying to confuse you
i had to talk to myself, hov you used to it
it's politics as usual
