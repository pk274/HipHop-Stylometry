and all that shit real too, ah
i ain't gon' stop
i see the...
i'm ain't gon' stop
i'm ain't... haha
we the best music


v12, see ya, 12 (bye)
i do the whole dash with no seatbelt
screamin', "free my nigga meek mill"
niggas can't wheelie in this free world
meanwhile georgie porgie cinnamon sendin' me threats
save your breath, you couldn't beat a flight of steps
try that shit with a grown man
i'll kill that fuckboy with my own hand
and hop back in the coupe (woo, woo)
let's go back to the mud, i'll hop right out the suit
save all that woopty-woop
let's let the money talk, let the uzi shoot
no jewels in this patek philippe
it's complicated, three million apiece
sheesh, that's how we do time
dujac by the mag, that's how we do wine
91 thousand for a wine bill
keep it real with you, that was juan's bill
my whole team ball
everybody's a star but the team ball
'61 with the thing off
me and blue havin' a sing-off
that's a raspberry beret
the kind you find in a second-hand store
that's a vintage piece
kind that make haters kiss their teeth, you can't buy this new
i had the 'bach-bach-bach, you know how i do
two-tone with the powder blue (woo)
realest shit to come out the stu'
khaled is valid, every word is true
what these niggas gon' do without us, gu'?


i chopped the top off in otis
ridin' 'round town with the flotus
one-point-five for the landaulet
bey, put these fuckboys on notice (fuckboys on notice)
