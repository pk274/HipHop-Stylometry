back when emory jones was catchin' the fed' charge
i knew less about chessimar
all about pablo escobar
thinkin' i was the last one allah would lay his blessings on
i was trying not to end up like tony in the restaurant
now i'm the general of the geechie army
what don't kill us make us stronger, that's nietzsche on me
hot boy like i'm b.g., that fiji on me
we done ducked them fed' charges, now we eatin' confit
le fric, c'est chic
that guilt trip ain't gon' work, don't put your luggage on we
you ain't keep the same energy for the du pont's and carnegie's
we was in your cotton fields, now we sittin' on bs, on me
