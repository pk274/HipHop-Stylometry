ayo hov, tell 'em, hip-hop better wake up
yeah, turn the motherfuckin' music up
yeah, turn the motherfuckin' music up


i need rims that don't glisten and a booming system
first piece of change i see, i'm gon' get one
745 no license to drive
i ain't even got a home, i guess i'll live in my ride
fuck it (rewind)
(i can hear myself, but i can't feel myself)
(i wanna feel myself like tweet)
745 no license to drive
i ain't even got a home, i guess i'll live in my ride
fuck it, couple karats in the ear won't hurt
need a nice chain, laying on this thousand dollar shirt
evisu jeans cover the rectum, my kick game just like david beckham
anybody in my way, i wet them
i'ma be this way till the cops come catch 'em
til' detectives sketch 'em
on the sidewalk wit' chalk, new york's infections
til' i got taught a lesson
couple niggas gone, couple went corrections
emory got 10
ty got fifteen, nigga even my kin
got five years bringin' nineteen in
but just think i used to think like them
now they gotta live through the pictures that i send them in the pen
hope you don't start ya life where i end
(wake up)
