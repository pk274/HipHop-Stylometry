shawn was on that gospel shit
i was on the total fuckin' opposite
shit, stuff a million dollars in the sock drawer
that's a war chest in case you need your chest knocked off
y'all be talkin' crazy under them ig pictures
so when you get to hell you tell 'em blanco sent ya
i can't take no threats, i got a set of twins (ah)
those were just some words you'll never hear again (uh huh)
for the final time you don't believe these fools
i've never seen a worker rock so many jewels (never)
i've never seen the runner with so many cars (never)
y'all couldn't stop me, you're not as tough as you say you are
my advice is just don't be too nice to niggas
just set your price on niggas and live your life, my nigga
once upon a time in the projects
shawn was in flight mode, i bought a pyrex
i was in fight mode and now it's "fuck me, mijo"
i was movin' them kilos, help you move your peoples
sometimes you need your ego, gotta remind these fools
who they effin' with, and we got fn's too
before we had a&r's, we had ar's too
we the only ones really movin' like y'all say y'all do
we still movin' like y'all niggas say y'all did
emory passed you niggas and he did a bid
ty ty jumped over niggas and he's like 5'6"
got the heart of a giant, don't you ever forget
don't you never forget, jigga got this shit poppin'
i pulled out the pot when we was outta options
