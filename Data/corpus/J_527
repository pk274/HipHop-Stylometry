aye yo
time to reunite 'em
yeah
it's the commission, niggas
b-i-g lives on
no more music, brooklyn
uh, uh, uh, uh, let's go!
it's fuckin' deadly


lucky lefty of the commission, bow down
by now you fuckers know this is our crown
bucktown bullies, brooklyn biggie
bedstuy hov like bedstuy gold
behold the fly-est (the commission)
bentley drivers, louis vuitton buyers
jet fuel abusers, sippin' petrus
once upon a time in america's muse
you based on us, you fiction
ya eight's don't bust, you a constant contradiction
ladies please use contraception
conception's at a all time high with sexin'
use protection
you fuckers shoulda never been born, shoulda never got signed
how the fuck you got on?
how the fuck you got shawn?
i'm too advanced, the lance armstrong of the dance
rubberband man before t.i. was
king of new york like b.i. was
b.k. all day, it's in my blood
you wanna see my mask and gloves?
what the fuck you want?
