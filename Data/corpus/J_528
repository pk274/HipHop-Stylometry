what's free?
free is when nobody else could tell us what to be
free is when the tv ain't controllin' what we see
told my niggas, "i need you"
through all the fame, you know i stayed true
pray my niggas stay free
made a few mistakes but this ain't where i wanna be
before i'm judged by 12, put a 12 on my v
told my niggas, "i need you"
stay up, i know these times ain't true (run it down)
real life, what's free?


in the land of the free, where the blacks enslaved
three-fifths of a man, i believe's the phrase
i'm 50% of d'uss√© and it's debt free (yeah)
100% of ace of spades, worth half a b (uh)
roc nation, half of that, that's my piece
hunnid percent of tidal to bust it up with my gs, uh
'cause most of my niggas won't ever work together
you run a check up but they never give you leverage
no red hat, don't michael and prince me and 'ye
they separate you when you got michael and prince's dna, uh
i ain't one of these house niggas you bought
my house like a resort, my house bigger than yours
my spou- (come on, man)
my route better, of course
we started without food in our mouth
they gave us pork and pig intestines
shit you discarded that we ingested, we made the project a wave
you came back, reinvested and gentrified it
took niggas' sense of pride, now how that's free?
and them people stole the soul and hit niggas with 360s, huh
i ain't got a billion streams, got a billion dollars
inflating numbers like we 'posed to be happy about this
we was praisin' billboard, but we were young
now i look at billboard like, "is you dumb?"
to this day, grandma 'fraid what i might say
they gon' have to kill me, grandmama, i'm not they slave
ha-ha-ha-ha-ha, check out the bizarre (ah)
rappin' style used by me, the h-o-v
look at my hair free, carefree, niggas ain't near free
enjoy your chains, what's your employer name with the hairpiece?
i survived the hood, can't no shaytan rob me
my accountant's so good, i'm practically livin' tax free
factory, that's me
sold drugs, got away scot-free
that's a cc, e-copy
guilt free, still me
and expect me to not feel a way to this day
you would say y'all killed me
sucker free, no shuckin' me, i don't jive turkey
say "happy thanksgiving," shit sound like a murder to me
smoke free, all of y'all callin' out toll free
label rob you for millions yet you wanna put a hole in me
sugar free, seasoned but i'm salt free
you lay a hand on hov, my shooter shoot for free
i promise world war three
send a order through a hands free
kill you in 24 hours or shorter, you can't ignore the hand speed
on god, it's off the head, this improv but it's no comedy
sign i fail? hell nah
(ha-ha-ha-ha-ha) hahahahahahahahaha
