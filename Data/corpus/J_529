rough the way it oughta be

if you play, you pay the price
nobody to your rescue, not 
i got a split personality when i drop
for honies it's c.l. smooth for niggas it's pete rock
growin' up in the hood like mc eiht but i ain't wanna bite, i'm wonder mike
brothers go solo, i mean so low on the track
and if you give that tape i'm like cool, but
