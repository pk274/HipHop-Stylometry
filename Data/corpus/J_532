jeah
yeah, yeah
how real is this, how real is this
inspect this here, check


i'm from where the hammer's rung new's cameras never come
you and your man houndin' every verse in your rhyme
where the grams is slung, niggas vanish every summer
where the blue vans would come we throw the work in the can
and run
where the plans was to get funds and skate off the set
to achieve this goal quicker, sold all my weight wet
faced with immeasurable odds still i get straight bets
so i felt some more something and you nothing check
i from the other side with other guys don't walk too much
and girls in the projects wouldn't fuck us if we talked too
much
so they ran up town and sought them dudes to trust
i don't know what the fuck they thought those niggas is foul
just like us
i'm from where the beef is inevitable, summertime's
unforgetable
boosters in abundance, buy a half-price sweater new
your world was everything, so everything you said you'd do
you did it, couldn't talk about it if you ain't lived it
i from where niggas pull your car, and argue all day about
who's the best mc's, biggie, jay-z, and nas
where the drugs czars evolve, and thugs always are
at each other's throats for the love of foreign cars
cats catch cases, hoping the judge r and r's
but most times find themselves locked up behind bars
i'm from where they ball and breed rhyme stars
i'm from marcy son, just thought i'd remind y'all


cough up a lung, where i'm from, marcy son, ain't nothing
nice
mentally been many places but i'm brooklyn's own
cough up a lung, where i'm from, marcy son, ain't nothing
nice
mentally been many places but i'm brooklyn's own
cough up a lung, where i'm from, marcy son, ain't nothing
nice
mentally been many places but i'm brooklyn's own
cough up a lung, where i'm from, marcy son, ain't nothing
nice


cough up a lung, where i'm from, marcy son, ain't nothing
nice
mentally been many places but i'm brooklyn's own
cough up a lung, where i'm from, marcy son, ain't nothing
nice
mentally been many places but i'm brooklyn's own
cough up a lung, where i'm from, marcy son, ain't nothing
nice
mentally been many places but i'm brooklyn's own
cough up a lung, where i'm from, marcy son, ain't nothing
nice


i'm from where they cross-over and clap boards
lost jehovah in place of rap lords, listen
i'm up the block, round the corner, and down the street
from where the pimps, prostitutes, and the drug lords meet
we make a million off of beats, 'cause our stories is deep
and fuck tomorrow, as long as the night before was sweet
niggas get lost for weeks in the streets, twisted off weed
and no matter the weather, niggas know how to draw heat
whether your four-feet or minute size, it always starts out
with
three dice and shoot the five
niggas thought they douce was live, and now hit 'em with
trips
and i reached down for their money, pa forget about this
this time around it's platinum, like the shit on my wrist
and this glock on my waist, y'all can't do shit about this
niggas will show you love, that's how they fool thugs
before you know it your lying in a pool of blood


cough up a lung, where i'm from, marcy son, ain't nothing
nice
mentally been many places but i'm brooklyn's own
cough up a lung, where i'm from, marcy son, ain't nothing
nice
mentally been many places but i'm brooklyn's own
cough up a lung, where i'm from, marcy son, ain't nothing
nice
mentally been many places but i'm brooklyn's own
cough up a lung, where i'm from, marcy son, ain't nothing
nice
