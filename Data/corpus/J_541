ugh, yo, they say the good die young in the hood where i'm from
i only got one question to that: why the fuck am i here?
i look to the air, ask god, "love me, please"
but in reality, only people that hug me is thieves
same niggas that send shots through my rugby sleeves
they wanna slug me and leave, i'm thinkin' it must be me
please shed light, the hood's dark
i did my dirt but got a good heartâ€”
shouldn't that count for somethin'?
i was told i'd amount to nothin' most of my childhood life
by folks that was stuntin' my growth
separated me from the shit i was wantin' the most
felt myself comin' close to pumpin' them o's
lump in my throat, chest poked out, face was poker
tryin' to erase my ghostses, chase the smokers
got demons on both shoulders
tryin' to chauffeur my life through the streets
in other words, nigga, my will was weak
please feel what i speak
this ain't your average, ordinary, jargon, weak rap niggas be talkin'
this shit is deep, from the mind of busta, x, and me
to all my fallen soldiers, rest in peace, 'til we meet, niggas
