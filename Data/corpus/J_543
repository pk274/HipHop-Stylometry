y'all just so metrosexual
this is not my politically correct flow
this is more like letting that tec blow
this is more like a left when they say right
when the world do you wrong but you play right
this is more like pushing that white rock
when the world try to put you in a tight box
coming down in the drop with the system crank
'cause you don't give a fuck what the system think
y'all comin up m.i.—m.i.—m.i.a
semi-spray when you in my way
i'mma be who i'm gonna be
i'm just a boy from the hood
what you want from me?
ugh
