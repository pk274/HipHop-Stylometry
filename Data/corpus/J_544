mami, got me, buying property
speeding too fast, high velocity
coppin' bracelets, baby rock piece
vacay, saint-tropez and capri
and usually i be on my shit
harlem shakin' these groupies off me quick
but this time it's diff
think the love gon' stick
like velcro, let go, hell no
ma, you know you got me
