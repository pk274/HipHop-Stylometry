in the south nigga
deep in the four door, watchin' that o dog
or in the club nigga, shakin' them hoes off
poppin my foes off, ain't nothin changed
or catch me on the block with thugs knockin' them o's off
baggin that 'dro nigga, stackin' that dough
clappin' at foes and i'm laughin' at hoes
holdin' them dice and i'm breakin'' yo bank
you see the shit roc-a-fella make wit' the tank
even without the airplay platinum off of hearsay
"it's your year jay!" get off my dick
been my year, you talkin' to a winner here
iceberg winter's wear, linen chair
my style in fact, money ain't come from rap
and we can take it right back if it comes to that
block or billboard, you gotta feel dog
i stay real y'all, that's how i kill y'all
