forever young, i wanna be forever young
do you really want to live forever, forever, and ever? (uh)
forever young (young), i wanna be forever young (forever young)
(ayy, may the best of your todays be the worst of your tomorrows)
do you really want to live forever, forever? forever young
(but we ain't even thinkin' that far, ya know what i mean?)


so we living life like a video (video)
where the sun is always out and you never get old
and the champagne's always cold and the music's always good
and the pretty girls just happen to stop by in the hood
and they hop they pretty ass up on the hood of that pretty ass car
without a wrinkle in today 'cause there's no tomorrow
just a picture-perfect day that last a whole lifetime
and it never ends 'cause all we have to do is hit rewind
so let's just stay in the moment, smoke some weed, drink some wine
reminisce, talk some shit, forever young is in your mind
leave a mark they can't erase, neither space nor time
so when the director yells cut, i'll be fine
i'm forever young


fear not when, fear not why, fear not much while we're alive
life is for living, not living uptight, 'til you're somewhere up in the sky
fear not die, i'll be alive for a million years, bye bye's
are not for legends, i'm forever young, my name shall survive
through the darkest blocks, over kitchen stoves, over pyrex pots
my name shall be passed down to generations
while debating up in barbershops
young slung, hung here, showed that a nigga from here
with a little ambition, just what we can become here (yeah)
and as the father pass the story down to his son's ears
young'll get younger every year, yeah
so if you love me, baby, this is how you let me know
don't ever let me go, that's how you let me know, baby


forever young, i wanna be forever young
do you really want to live forever, forever, and ever?
forever young, i wanna be forever young (forever young)
do you really want to live forever, forever? forever young
(just let it run)


slamming bentley doors, hopping outta porsches
popping up on forbes' list, gorgeous (hold up)
niggas thought i lost it, they be talking bullshit
i be talking more shit, they nauseous (hold up)
i'll be here forever, you know i'm on my fall shit
and i ain't with foreclosure, i will never forfeit
less than four bars, guru bring the chorus in
did you get the picture yet?
i'm painting you a portrait of young
