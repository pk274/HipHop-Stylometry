mama, help, i fell in love with a young girl
what on earth, what i'm supposed to do?
young girl, so in love with you
what on earth, what i'm supposed to do?
what on earth, what i'm supposed to do?
what on earth, what i'm supposed to do?
somebody tell me what i'm supposed to do
my heart was soakin' and got broken in a young world (hov)
what on earth, what i'm supposed to do? (hov)
young girl, so in love with you


hov got a young girl, hov got a young girl (got a young girl)
still not quite twenty one
so high strung, such a vibrant thing
i introduce myself, "hi, miss thing"
you're nineteen? (woo)
no, you're lightning in a bottle, i give you a ring tomorrow
the scene that follows
screams of horror
classic stephen king novel
mama don't think you should date someone so advanced in romance, you should just wait
papa don't preach, hov don't bite
hov been through it, i might mold your life
plus i'ma show you right
proper etiquette, how to hold your knife
keep it competitive with oprah's ice
be like janet, take control of your life
