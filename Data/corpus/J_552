just some ghetto boys
living in these ghetto streets (these ghetto streets)
and every day, they gotta fight to stay alive
it's just reality (yeah, make you a deal, check)


these here's the dog years and motherfuckers don't shed
i try to bring you life, but motherfuckers want dead
so i travel with the barrel, with the chrome, with the lead
'cause when it's on, then it's on, the shots flown through your head
i been rich, i been poor, i saved and blown bread
some say i been here before because of the way i zone
some said jigga's zone's like the falling of rome
reoccurring, that he thinks like that 'cause he's observant
won't be known until i'm gone and niggas study my bones
mentally, been many places, but i'm brooklyn's own
in the physical, unseen like allah's body
in fact, my thoughts don't differ much from that of god body
but it's the r-shotty that got cats likening me to the mob john gotti
rap dudes biting me 'cause i got it locked like the late bob marley
pardon me, y'all, the great bob marley
solemnly, we mourn all the rappers that's gone
niggas that got killed in the field and all the babies born
know they ain't fully prepared for this new world order
so i keep it ghetto like sunflower seeds and quarter waters
to walk 'em through it, you know, talk 'em through it
know these beats is more than music whenever i talk to it
destined for greatness, and y'all knew this when i doubled the buy
had a shorty in a girdle coming out of bwi (in school)
i hated algebra, but i loved to multiply
and i told my nigga b.i.g. i'd be multi before i die
and it's gon' happen, whether rapping or clapping, have it your way
'cause if that's my dough you're trapping, i'm clapping your way, it's for the ghetto
