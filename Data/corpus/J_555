yeah, you would think i was on 'roids
i been hitting so long and i'm a big headed boy
nah we ain't on hgh

(running through your state) nah, nah, nah, we ain't on the clear
we on the runway in back to back lairs (in the air)
yeah yeah, it's ms. no more drama
and barack obama rhymers, feel honored (talk to 'em hov)
i put my life on these tracks
you act like y'all don't wanna pay me for the facts
luckily my therapy is to rap
i just bare my soul i don't expect nothing back (get it up)
you're all welcome, long as you felt them
i was gon' get mine, you know where the hell i'm from
i'm from the bottom, so i do this from the diapers
quick fast, turn the big apple into cider
i do this, i'm a writer and a rider
spew it 'cause i'm nicer, but i do this for the lifers (tell 'em again hov)
i'm a writer and a rider

and ma, when mary sing it heals your heart (*hands up!)
god so lisa stansfield you are
love is a battlefield, we all get scarred
i put my heart into this
this is much more than marketed music
the reason i got a market to do this

(i'm here for you) this ain't no marketed music
people going through pain, i'm just talking 'em through it, you're welcome
