i mean...
ush, is this what it comes to man?
this how we gon' do it?
i mean, even grass grow, baby, you know?
seeds become plants, boys become men
what we gon' do? let's lead the way


uh, wrapped around all girls like pashminas
what's my demeanor? the grass is always greener
on the other side, there's thicker thighs, can't give a ring up
i couldn't give a fuck, how could i give a finger?
let alone half bath and closets
so claustrophobic, in fear of close objects
now it's sort of like two-car garages
it's like two broads menagin', you're the best, mama


uh, momma try to told me, "hovi hov' to slow it down
you gon' lose your best thing if you keep getting 'round"
like pac, need a partner when you old to hold you down
ma, forever young, was forever numb
sorry stacy, sorry dawn, amil-lion and all of them
all of them was for their time, it wasn't you, it was him
school me once, school me twice, three times, i was dumb
now it's so plain to see to me i got the one
you're the best, mama
