big chips! big trips to vegas, nigga
big cribs and the whips is spacious (uh huh)
any day they could dig your grave
shit, so big is my inspiration, dig?
no reward unless the risk is taken
in which case you niggas wouldn't wanna switch places
i, on the other hand, relish the situation
thank the lord for the gift, i'm gracious
i went overboard, look at this big bracelet
i overhauled it, you wouldn't recognize it
from the time that i bought it, i just replaced it
i risk cases for shit like this
nigga , i pray for some shit like this
word to my uncle ray, who gave his life for some shit like this
ma, you rolling? i'm as real as it gets


big chips! i'm a boss i said
tilt my hat and i cross my legs
like old ladies at the park, i toss my bread
and the pigeons start flocking, ballin' like bishop loughlin
and stick cochran on any d.a. that try to stop him
so any gunplay, that is an option
i been doing this since niggas was wopping
rockin izods with the matching socks, and
slap boxing in the back park and when the girls start watching
to try to get real, you had to drop 'em
see i ain't never been a fronter
or fake it 'til i make it type nigga
ma i don't want ya number
either you're coming or i won ya
either you know what you want ma, or i don't even want ya
you play pretty if you wanna, hah
