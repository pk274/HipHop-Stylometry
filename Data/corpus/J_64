you know i
thug 'em, fuck 'em, love 'em, leave 'em
‘cause i don't fuckin' need 'em
take 'em out the hood, keep 'em lookin' good
but i don't fuckin' feed 'em
first time they fuss, i'm breezin'
talkin' 'bout, "what's the reasons?"
i'm a pimp in every sense of the word, bitch
better trust and believe 'im
in the cut where i keep 'em
'til i need a nut, 'til i need to beat the guts, then it's
"beep beep," then i'm pickin' them up
let 'em play with the dick in the truck
many chicks wanna put jigga fists in cuffs
divorce him and split his bucks
just because you got good head, i'ma break bread
so you can be livin' it up? shit, i
parts with nothin', y'all be frontin'
me give my heart to a woman?
not for nothin', never happen
i'll be forever mackin'
heart cold as assassins
i got no passion
i got no patience, and i hate waitin'
ho, get your ass in, and
