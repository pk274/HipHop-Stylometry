uhh, she wants that old thing back
uh, uh, uh
she want those heroin tracks
she likes me
she fiends for me nightly
she leans for me
morning, she rush for my touch
this is about lust
cold sweats occur when i'm not with her
my presence is a must- must- must-
bonita applebum, i gotta put you on
if i didn't when we cutting, the feeling'll be too strong
in any form, i'm giving you sweet dreams
that sugar hill, she call me her sweet thing
that black rain will take away your pain
just for one night, baby, take me in vein
now that feelin' got you tripping
you don't wanna feel no different
this here lust has got you itching
nose wide open and it's dripping (eh, eh, eh, eh)
i know what you like, i am your prescription
i'm your physician, i'm your addiction

i am so dope (uhh)
like louboutins with the red bottoms
you gotta have 'em, you glad you got 'em
like every color giuseppe's, your guilty pleasure is me
it's so much fun, you shun therapy
although it never be, the feeling is fleeting
shopping's like copping, you constantly need it
i'm never around, you constantly seek it
you'll never be down, i know where your peak is
9 1/2 weeks is better than 12-steps
i keep trying to remind you to keep telling yourself
now your conscience is interfering, like "better yourself!"
like you better get help
but when that medicine's felt
we're back together, don't ever leave me
don't ever let 'em tell you that you'll never need me
my china white, 'til we d.o.a
its montega forever, baby, lets get away...


and i know, and i know, and i know, and i know (uhh, i know what you like)
and i know, and i know, and i know, and i know (i know what you love)
everything you like, everything you love (baby you like ....hov'!)
everything you like, everything you love (baby you love ....hov'! baby you love, hehehe, uhh)
and i know, and i know, and i know, and i know
and i know, and i know, and i know, and i know (baby you love ....hov'!)
everything you like, everything you love (baby you like ....hov'! baby you like ....hov'!)
everything you like, everything you love, damn (baby you like ....hov'!)


how could you leave me?
i thought that you needed me!
when the world got too much and you pleaded with me
who helped you immediately? how speedy of me!
how could you deny me so vehemently?
now your body is shaking, trying to free it of me
and your soul is in control, trying to lead it from me
and your heart no longer pledge allegiance to me
damn, i'm missing the days when you needed the d!


and i know, and i know, and i know, and i know (uhh, i know what you like)
