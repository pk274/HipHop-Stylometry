i'm good on any mlk boulevard
i'm good on any mlk boulevard
see my vision with a tech, bitch, i'm malcolm x
haters dreadin' my effect, they want that das efx
get your hands up high like a false arrest
let me see 'em up high, this is not a test
yes, put 'em up, this is not a test
now hands where i can see them, fuck a false arrest


this off-white fit that i rock, shit permanent
hmm, the fro that i grow got no perm in it
hmm, a nigga late but he best dressed
got slowed down by the weight of my necklaces
parked the lexus in the projects, bitch i'm reckless
extra magazine hopped on a jet with my ebony chick
blacker than the essence fest
the behind the back pass is so effortless
lebron james to you omaroses
dapper dan at 4am, shit, i am the culture
i made my own waves so now they’re anti-tidal
i’m livin' the no sock life to spite you
since the kalief doc, they've been at my neck
y'all can tell 'em trayvon is comin' next
the sec, the fbi or the irs
i pass the alphabet boys like an eye test

i'm good anywhere i go, anywhere i go (go)
i pull up like the freedom riders, hop out on rodeo
stunt with your curls, your lips, sarah baartman hips
gotta hop into my jeans like i hop into my whip yeah
mobbin' in a hoodie like melo
come up out that pretty motherfucker like "hello, hello"
i will never let you shoot the nose off my pharaoh
i like purple and purple rain
tryin' to put red and blue together, bitch, that's on gang
these people tryna get me out the paint
'cause i cook collard greens and yams better than your aunt
man, we started with a mustard seed
now we in the gray 911 with the mustard seats
sheesh! matte black puma jet
shining my light on the world just like "umi says"
got the richard mille all colors
might hit you with the rose gold all summer
for the culture
they even biting cornrows, put your scarecrows up
i come from the finest crop
tell em the god's on row, watch them line the block
the chitlin' circuit is stopped
now we in stadiums, eighty thou a wop, watch


i'm good on any mlk boulevard (he good)
i'm good on any mlk boulevard (we good)
see my vision with a tec, bitch, i'm malcolm x (i'm malcom x)
haters dreadin' my effect, they want that das efx (yeah)
get your hands up high like a false arrest
