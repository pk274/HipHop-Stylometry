yeah, yeah, i'm a monster
i sleep whole winters, wake up and spit summers
ghetto nigga, putting up will smith numbers (ugh)
surrounded by sixes and hummers, bitches among us
trying not to let this bullshit become us
it started from hunger 'til it all went insane
now, bitches notice the chains now that i hit my number
the chickens i twisted (ugh), see the digits unlisted (yeah)
the beeper done changed
your dead, bitch, the reaper done came
i suggest niggas stop speaking my name
'cause trust me, y'all could still feel the heat in the rain
i keep creepin', streets keep watchin', i keep poppin'
niggas is hotheads and the bullets is heat-seeking
jay flow for pesos, chase hoes, not
i just circle 'round the block in a drop
tell 'em jump through the top (uh-huh)
where the sunroof used to be
i could see y'all not used to me
nigga, flows like none other (ugh)
i'm the meanest, toughest don dada to gun-butt ya
you the type to bust a lot of shots, and none touch you (fuck)
i'm the type that get excited when the gun touch ya, motherfuckers (ugh)
y'all niggas 'bout to witness a dynasty like no other
(uh-huh-uh-huh-uh)
