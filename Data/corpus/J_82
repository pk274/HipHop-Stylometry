put the kids to sleep on this one!

pop, lock and drop it
i make that pussy speak patois
like petra, ah, remember her?
remember me from the basement parties?
cause i remember you type like no panties
we blowing on nigga type e
brother rubbing so close stepping on my nikes
at the red light, never give me red light
only give me green light, you know what i mean right?
after my red stripe, hop up on my motorbike
show me what that motor like
show me you can roll it right
all of my guyanese girls, they're bohemians
all of my jamaicans, shake it for me, shake it then
