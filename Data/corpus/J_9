i swear to god, i just touched down


all around the world (oh)
same song (oh)
killer cali nigga (same song)
atl (oh, same song)
real-adelphia (oh)
dude it's (all around the world)


london, england, south of france
and all points between, they know about your man
konichiwa ladies when i'm out in japan
i'm a tokyo giant like ichiro, i am
piss poor nigga from the hood but i blew
now i bounce six-fours up and down crenshaw
spot me the hotel, the cap' or capri
bathrobe, slippers in the lobby like "oui"
your man'll stand manta ray, handlin' a steak
and handlin' a model standin' 'bout 5'8"
5'9", fine wine, fine dine, either that
or i'm mixin' in switzerland tryna buy time
ballin' out in bali when it's gorgeous out in cali
brunchin' at the four seasons off the heezy
then it's back home nigga, back to the zone
nigga back to the books to the rhymes that took me


all around the world
same song (same song)
brooklyn bombers (same song, same song)
detroit players (oh, same song)
chi-town (hey, all around the world)


said it's all love, shore club, m-i-a
party at bungalow 8 when i stay
pool look like a hundred beyoncés
a couple fiancés, i'm the new devante
come and talk to me mami in the yves saint
laurent, i hope she ain't too young (woo)
only twenty-one and older, let another nigga mold her
i'm just tryna show her how a baller and a roller
sleep one place, tell the pilot keep the engine
runnin' then i wake up in martha's vineyard
st. bart's this year i think i'm gon' spend christmas
reminiscin' 'bout the time my mom couldn't spend christmas
now i'm gon' send her on her own little wish list
anywhere in the world, anywhere for my girl
forever my lady, blind, crippled and crazy
a ticket and your favorite cd, sweet sadie


said it ain't, "where you from?" yo it's, "where you at?"
real niggas out in brooklyn, some niggas don't clap
it's real killers out in cali, some niggas just act
hollywood like they out the hood, it's all to the good
real players in the d-twa, some of them throwed
slackin' or they mackin', rest haven for hoes
real pranksters in the chi, most of them real folks
disciplined gangsters, come on charlie, i know
shit, it ain't about your city or borough
it's 'bout if you really as thorough and if you are, holla at your boy
i put my hand on my heart, that means i feel you
real recognize real and you lookin' familiar
i'm a bed-stuy nigga but i do it to death
i promise i'm in st. thomas homie eatin' at chef's
112, atl, the sun up yet?
then we party like the sun don't set
