brooklyn, we go hard, we go hard (agh!)
brooklyn, we go hard, we go hard (go hard)
brooklyn, we go hard, we go hard
brooklyn, we go hard, we go hard
brooklyn, we go hard, we go hard
brooklyn, we go hard, we go hard
brooklyn, we go hard, we go hard
brooklyn, we go hard, we go hard


this is black hoodie rap
there's no fear in my eyes where they lookin' at
better look on map
besides, me nah like to eye fight
me nah think such a ting is worth a man's life (christ!)
but if a man test my stuy
i promise he won't like my reply
boom-bye-bye, like buju, i'm crucial
i'm a brooklyn boy, i may take some gettin' use to
chain snatchin', ain't have it, gotta get it
same shiddit, from brownsville to bainbriddidge
fatherless child, mama pulled double shifts
so the number runners was the only ones i hanged widdith
before you know it i'm in the game, bang fiddith
fear no orangutans, piddeel ciddaps
like oranges-es, i'm dangerous
please! tell me what the name of this shit


brooklyn we go hard, we go hard
brooklyn we go hard, we go hard
brooklyn we go hard, we go hard
brooklyn we go hard, we go hard
brooklyn we go hard, we go hard (b-r, o, o-k)
brooklyn we go hard, we go hard (l-y, n, come again)
brooklyn we go hard, we go hard (b-r, o, o-k)
brooklyn we go hard, we go hard (l-y, n, come again)


i father, i brooklyn-dodger them
i jack, i rob, i sin
aw, manâ€”i'm jackie robinson
'cept when i run base, i dodge the pen
lucky me, luckily, they didn't get me
now when i bring the nets, i'm the black branch rickey
from brooklyn corners, burnin' branches of sticky
spread love, biggie; brooklyn, hippie
i pity the fool with jewels like mr. t
with no history in my borough, they borrow
with no intentions of returnin' tomorrow
the sun don't come out for many, like annie
half-orphan, mama never had an abortion
papa sort of did; still, i managed to live
i go hard, i owe it all to the crib
now please tell me, what the fuck's harder than this?


brooklyn we go hard, we go hard
brooklyn we go hard, we go hard
brooklyn we go hard, we go hard
brooklyn we go hard, we go hard
brooklyn we go hard, we go hard (b-r, o, o-k)
brooklyn we go hard, we go hard (l-y, n, come again)
brooklyn we go hard, we go hard (b-r, o, o-k)
brooklyn we go hard, we go hard (l-y, n, come again)
