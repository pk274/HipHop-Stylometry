i'm right here fab, waving the flag, i'm from nostrand ave
i came to take the game in my daddy kane chain
niggas gave it up smooth
they ain't want to hear the bang, bang
i'm back on my bully shit
that flatbush, bushwick black hoodie shit
half a billie in the bank roll
bank stop anybody, what's your bank, ho?
big b's on the wheel
spread love the brooklyn way, b how's it feel?
i'm on my robin thicke shit
shit ever gets thick, back to robbing niggas quick
trick, click, ante up
all you niggas britney, pull your panties up
whole borough is with me, hold your cannons up
buck one for bucktown, brooklyn, what the fuck?!!
