if you feelin like a pimp nigga, go and brush your shoulders off
ladies is pimps too, go and brush your shoulders off
niggas is crazy baby; don't forget that boy told you
get, that, dirt off your shoulder


'cause it's a bittersweet…symphony this life
(if you feelin like a pimp nigga, go and brush your shoulders off)
(ladies is pimps too, go and brush your shoulders off)
trying to make ends meet, you’re a slave to money then you die


you gotta get, that, dirt off your shoulder
