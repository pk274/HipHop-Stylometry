i don't give a fidduck abiddout the widdate
you used to move, what you used to do
and i don't give a fidduck abiddout the bitches
that you used to screw, what your future do
and we don't really care what you used to say
unless that affects your future pay
i'm on a practice field runnin' two-a-days
so i don't drop the ball when it's threw my way
so i don't give a fidduck abiddout the shit
that you probably did, who you probably is
the only time i deal in past tense
'cause i'm past rims, and i'm past tints
if you drivin' it, i drove it
you got it, 'cause i sold it
you copped it, i bought it back
and we don't give a fidduck, nigga we off that
