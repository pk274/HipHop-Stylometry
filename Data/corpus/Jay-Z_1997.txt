drinking sake, it's me, and my mami with the doobie
cutie, smelling like miyake, half-philippine thing
for now, let's call her suki, got me, this booty banging
properly, in versace pants, cocky bow-legged stance
a thing of beauty, watch me, body crazy
tits firm like nature, foxy, nas and az
truly reason to bug the toolie and keep laced in jewelry, watch me
girlie tried to lure me and lock me you gotta get up early
'cause who's getting played is not me
"surely you jest," she said, "if you thought i was purely
out for the bucks you woulda bucked stuck and dropped me"
i said maturely, "you right
but better safe than sorry, before the lovebirds
can move to the suburbs, i need to double check your story
to make sure that you one of a kind
and you deserve to be my sunshine"


touch me with, a heart of gold (uh-huh)
i can't go a day without my sunshine (uh-huh) ahh-haaa (say what? uhh)
touch me with, a smile of gold (yeah)
i can't go a day without my sunshine, sunshine (uhh, uhh, uhh)


a year gone, and she seeing things most chicks only
hear in songs (uh-huh), keep in gear phenom
lots of ice in the air, round the neck the charm (that's right)
risked a four to life bid to keep that shit on her arm
keep her impressed at all times, cats would love to creep (uh-huh)
just to say they crept with mine, slept with mine, she said


i ain't deaf nor blind, niggas stressing
hating 'cause they less than mine, they wanna sex me
we chose each other, you acting like you chose me
they oppose you then, they oppose me
we could creep at a low speed, the gat in the hosiery
double cross you they got to triple cross me
(i'm thinking that's the way it's supposed to be) uh-huh
(one more thing:
if i ever go broke, would you hit the block for me?) fo' sho'
(she replied, eyes open wide) uhhhh
(put that on everything?) i put that on my life
(right)


touch me with, a heart of gold (uh-huh)
i can't go a day without my sunshine (uh-huh) ahh-haaa (say what? uhh)
touch me with, a smile of gold (uhh)
i can't go a day without my sunshine, sunshine (uhh, uhh, uhh)


if i need it would you, give me (uhh) your kidneys? (uhh, fo' sho')
catch a case, you catch it with me? (mmm, fo' sho')
pawn your jewelry to come get me? (you better know)
catch me with a chick (uhh), forgive me? (now that, i don't know)
they spread rumors, will you defend me, tooth and nail? (uh-huh)
they try to frame me, will you be there, 'til the truth prevail? (uhh)
(but would you be the same dude, when you blow the roof off sales
that you was, throwin' rocks, on the roof at 12, nigga?)
this is the truth i shall, 'til the loot gets frail
i put this on my nephews, from the smallest to the pale
me and you balling, from the heavens, or the hell
won't let you hit the ground if i'm falling myself
now picture me leaving you in this cold world, rolling for delf
it's me and you in this old girl, we taking the belt
from the lows, to the highs, to the foes we shine
just continue to be my sunshine, uhh

uh-huh uh, the saga continues...
motion picture shit


i'm done talking
ran up in the spot gun smoking
shot it in the air, one woke him
son soaking, sweating in his bed like dun' loc'in!
thinking to himself what done provoked him
his thoughts is racing like a vulcan
i swear i saw a light bulb when
he finally realized who was the culprit
i said yeah, remember me from friend or foe when
i told you don't ever ever come around here no more
time to pay now, you try to rise, i wave the gun - lay down
this time you're really going to listen to jay now
i try to talk sensibly, hoping that eventually you realize
i had this locked and it just wasn't meant to be
plus i had sympathy when we all bought rims with your keys
and it was an afterthought that maybe you'll try to avenge me
but i was like "nah", homes had to know he was wrong
and if you caught me on the foul now you sing me the same song
plus you promised
and that's really no fun
and here i find you in this motel 6 with all these guns
and all your goons, lined up in adjoining rooms
like some wild cowboys coming to get me at high noon
but my mind's like a flower in bloom
peep how my eyes just scour the room
i'm alert, plus i paid the clerk i got it laid out
you think you the first nigga i played out, in a two-hotel town?
come on now, i peeped your lexus as you
left the exit got some niggas on that side of the town
money well invested, rudely interrupted
jamaican accent (boy you know who you dun fucked with?)
a gun in your face and that's all you can come up with?
i'm done talking, back up and clap him, one in the abdomen
do me a favor duke, get two ice cubes i pass them
take that ice up, for the nicest mc
and please yo, tell big, he's unbelievable
friend or foe biatch!

yeah, i mean like
i gotta be like the pioneer to this shit, you know
i was popping that cristal
when all y'all niggas thought it was beer and shit, you know
wearing that platinum shit
when all y'all chicks thought it was silver and shit
(imaginary playmates)
i got, i got to be the pioneer to this shit, man
bottom line (imaginary playmates)
i'ma show you how to do it, check it


yo, i spit that other shit
that's a nice motherfucker shit
that fed time follow me around, deep cover shit, nigga
you beer money, i'm all year money
i'm "papi, you ain't got to count it, it's all there" money
i never change money 'cause niggas got strange money
narc'd up, marked up, fucked up in the game money
i got bail money, double-xl money
you got flash now, but time will reveal money
i spit the hottest shit, you need it i got it shit
that down-south, master p, bout it bout it shit
i got blood money, straight up thug money
that brown paper bag under your mattress drug money
you got show dough, little to no dough
sell a bunch of records and you still owe dough
i got 900 and 96 plus 4 mo' dough
you crazy, you fugazi, i'm loco with dough papo


and now you got these young cats acting like they slung caps
all in they dumb raps, talking about how they funds stack
when i see them in the street, i don't see none of that
damn playboy, where the fuck is the hummer at?
where's all the ice with all the platinum under that?
those ain't rolex diamonds, what the fuck you done to that?
y'all rapping-ass niggas, y'all funny to me
you're selling records being you, but still you wanna be me
i guess for every buck you make it's like a hundred for me
and still you running around thinking you got something on me
but i done did it
and y'all want to take my flow, and run with it
that's cool, i was the first one with it
origin-al, jigga's the future, flow digit-al
still busting a gat when shit gets criti-cal
sit it down, i don't want y'all to get it confused
i rip it down, like i ain't got nothing to lose
(y'all get it now?)


groupies i leave 'em all fucked; niggas, awe struck
your single was 99 cents, mines was 4 bucks
last year, when niggas thought it was all up
but this year i've done it again, jigga! what the fuck?
nigga stop whining, jigga, still shining
niggas kept complaining so i copped more diamonds
rock more versace, ain't nothing sweet
i still throw t'ree in your body, fleeing the party
y'all can't go with me, nope, flow with me
bet 50, not dollars either i brought some dough with me
i flow like the 5 series, in various areas
and blow holes in your weak niggas theories
it's funny how one verse can fuck up the game
you bought a 4.0 you better get your change
ain't no platinum in those cartiers, switch your frames
ain't no manicurist on board, then switch your plane


i mean, like, be truthful, man: how you think you gon' feel, right?
you pull up in your 4.0 with your bitch
i pull up in the 4.6 with my bitch with the seat back
bumping some other shit, you know, some other shit
you probably hop on my dick right there, right in front of your bitch
ask me some stupid shit like
"yo, yo dog, what’s the difference between a 4.0 and a 4.6?"
like 30 to 40 grand, cocksucker, beat it! haha
yo, them shits even got leathers?

uh-huh, i did it again niggas
fucked up, right? ha, i know
i know what y'all niggas asking yourself
is he gon' ever fall off?
no...


a lot of speculation
on the monies i've made, honies i've slayed
how is he for real? is that nigga really paid?
hustlers i've met or, dealt with direct
is it true he stayed in beef and slept with a tec?
what's the position you hold?
can you really match a triple platinum artist buck by buck
but only a single goin' gold?
if roc-a-fella should fold, and you're left out in the cold
is it back to charging motherfuckers 11 for an o?
for the millionth time, asking me questions
like wendy williams, harassing me
then get upset when i catch feelings
can i get a minute to breathe? and in that minute you leave
while i'm looking at my rol' ice spinning on my sleeve
ugh, nice watch, do you really have a spot?
like you said in friend or foe and if so, what block?
what you doin in l.a., with filipinos and eses?
latinos and chevys, down by pico with frederico
i'll answer all your questions but then y'all got to go
now the question i ask you is, "how bad you wanna know?"
blaow!


motherfuckers can't rhyme no more, 'bout crime no more
'til i'm no more, 'cause i'm so raw
my flow expose holes that they find in yours
wasn't for me, niggas still be dying for whores
but i hate when a nigga sit back, admiring yours
young blood, you better get that, we frying because
niggas don't want to be confined to riding the iron horse
and don't listen to the rappers yo, they dying to floss
i used to be o.t., applyin' the force
shoot up the whole block, then the iron i toss
come back with the clique playing diana ross
i'm the boss and this is how it's gon' be
burnt the turnpike, wild miles on the v
i got mouths to feed 'til they put flowers on me
and kiss my cold cheek, chicks crying like i was cochise
tombstone read, "he was holdin' no leaks"
started from the crack game and then so sweet
freaked it to the rap game, jigga the o.g
on mtv, telling 'em how i sold d
and used to bag work up out of apartment 4-b
me and my homie, started out co-d's
picked the mailbox lock 'cause i ain't have no key
had the cable with the anchor when jaz made 'sophie'
then i went low key, but now i'm back, it's on
motherfuckers!


jigga, uh-huh, yeah
roc-a-fella y'all, uuuh

uh, roc-a-fella's capo, unflappable
test my weight in the apple
never a question of if, but when you gonna die like cattle
beef, i go at it so rugged, you swear, i love it

my burner give niggas permanent heart murmurs
if that ain't reason for concern (woo!)
my, crew endangers
estranged miscellaneous niggas
left in troubled waters like greg louganis
ain't nothin' touchin' from brooklyn to metuchen
or wherever the fuck you cats rest your head at, dead that
the last time you seen us, niggas popped up in beamers
shopped up in neiman's, locked hip-hop up between us
squeamish rappers stay out of my space like venus
or it's soulshocker, jigga niggademus
murderous writin', not a word of it to your likin'
since we make you hate to love it like prince
'til a nigga feel straight like bill gates
or feel a mil'-eight, we gon' spill hate, in-fil-trate
die! it's your fate, realize the great
get your hardhats, professionals rockin', nigga, wait
timing's everything, everything that glitters ain't gold
there's diamonds in every ring, what the fuck!
in the driver's seat, nigga used to live in the back
muggsy bogues style, now a nigga bigger than shaq
crib in the cat, skills, living phat
chickens that used to act ill
fuck y'all, i ain't forgivin' that (fuck y'all!)
a nigga bitter so, when a nigga hit you, believe (ugh)

say y'all, we livin' like s-t-a-rs
you faggot niggas don't play yours, my team'll slay yours
naysayers, can't fuck around we lay yours
with our hands up there, shit, i swear to god
since money's respected you know i had to get it
collect it like antiques, and let it stack
brrrrrrr, like that
i mastered this fast shit, now i move on
'cause too many bastards tried to get they groove on
and now you see me jiggy, you puzzled
he ain't sellin' no records, is he? that nigga gotta hustle
shit, you bet your guns, by any means, i get my ones
you intervene, by any means, i get ya done
for real

how can you fairly assess something from the outside looking in?
there's gotta be them times you'll be wrong, nah'mean?
how can a muh'fucka go round and hate a nigga
he never even met that, he don't even know and shit?
i think this rap shit is all beef


y'all don't even know every day i'm living with stress
got up out the streets, you think a nigga could rest
can't even enjoy myself at a party unless
i'm on the dance floor, hot ass vest
you think i'm freaking these chicks, right?
try not to brush against they chest
you get a lawsuit for shit like that, i feel trapped
swear to everything when i leave this earth
it's gon' be on both feet, never knees in the dirt
you could try me fucka but when i squeeze it hurts
fine, we'll lose two lives, yours and mines
gimme any amount of time, don't let ms. carter grieve
at the funeral parlor, dripping tears on my sleeve
told the judge, "didn't budge, it was him or me."
and i ain't trying to be hard but i'm guilty as charged
put my mercy on this court and my faith in god
and pray hard none of my nephews wanna be stars, lucky me


i hate all girls with ulterior motives
that's why i'm 20 plus years old, no sons, no daughters
hate putting my life in the hands of fake promoters
hear the hate in my voice, right? i hate that you noticed
niggas wanna strip you to the bone for shit you own
hate a nigga like that, faggot, get your own
hate that i can't roam the street without the clip and chrome
knowing one day i'ma have to flip, c'mon
you know the shit don't stop 'til the cris' don't pop
and you have to kill a nigga and your wrist don't lock
i'm trapped, the whole world's against me in fact
but ain't no turning back, bring it on
hate the price of fame 'cause it cost too much
can i live without y'all niggas saying i floss too much?
hate the way you make this hate flow all through us
steady looking for flaws through us, lucky me


you only know what you see
you don't understand what it takes to be me
you only know what you see
since i was four years old
i been told, everything that glitters ain't gold
you only know what you see
you don't understand what it takes to be me
and now that i've arrived
i see those truths unfold before my eyes in a world so cold


and niggas see you in the street, pretend to be friendly
but i know any type of success breeds envy
i know in the back of your mind you're conjuring ways to hem me
leave my friends in a circle pouring out henny
but g's is heaven bound so how i'm gon' receive
anything y'all pour to the ground next time throw it up
and ain't nothing changed so even in my afterlife i show it up
don't grieve for me, my art remains
like a dart from the speaker to your heart
spiritually through the portal now my words is immortal
don't plan to leave without a fight, i plant a seed i give life
though i can't see past the girl's greed to call her wife
next time you're thinking heist better be precise
'cause i'm fully prepared, one of us is gon' leave here
i have no regrets even though i won't see grow
my godson boogie, sonny and remo, lucky me


you only know what you see
i been told, since i was four years old
everything that glitters ain't gold
and now that i've arrived
you don't understand what it takes to be me
i see those truths unfold before my eyes in a world so cold

jigga! feel me!
pa-pause, told ya motherfuckers, told ya
"see that rap shit is really just like sellin smoke"
uhh, roc-a-fella
geyeah


we treat this rap shit just like, handlin' weight
what they want we give it to 'em, what they abandon we take
hit a rapper with consignment, let him know it's at stake
put his ass in the studio, let him cook up a cake
when it's hot, get on my money spot in every state
like the wiz and camelot, the mom-and-pop's is the gate
but first we scope shit, advertise in every area
let the fiends know hey, we got some dope shit
gon' need a middle man, so we look to radio
let 'em test the product, give 'em a promo show
just a breeze, not enough to catch a real vibe
then we drop a maxi single and charge 'em two for five
ain't tryin' to, kill 'em at first just, buildin' clientele
so when the album drops the first weeks it's on sale
but when demand grows it's time to expand yo
you don't want no garbage papi, it's ten grand per blow, fo' sho'


"somehow the rap game reminds me of the crack game"
"see that rap shit is really just like sellin' smoke"
"somehow the rap game reminds me of the crack game"
"see that rap shit is really just like sellin' smoke"
"somehow the rap game reminds me of the crack game"
"see that rap shit is really just like sellin' smoke"


ge-ge-geyeah
i got that uncut raw to make a fiend's body jerk
got your whole block now, pumpin' my work
my cd's is like keys for you willie's who
like to floss my cassette tapes in sixty-two's
and my singles like gems, you know the treys
get you high for a while, but the, high don't stay
you need another fix, you better cop these last two bricks
'cause when this shit flip, i'ma get on some other shit
never pitchin' for a label, jigga's the hook-up
you know my shit is fishscale, y'all niggas is cook up
just blow up, scream my name from brooklyn to da-kota
they know my shit stretch without the bakin' soda
went from an eighth, to a quarter, to a half a key
priority's work wasn't right so i switched factories
now i'm the new nigga, who figured i'd get the game locked
now watch how the prices of your cocaine drop, papa


"somehow the rap game reminds me of the crack game"
"see that rap shit is really just like sellin' smoke"
"somehow the rap game reminds me of the crack game"
"see that rap shit is really just like sellin' smoke"

but my time is money, and twenty-five, i can't afford it
beef assorted like godiva chocolates
niggas you bought it, i pull the slide back and cock it
plan aborted, you and your mans get a pass
this rhyme, you're operating on bitch time
y'all niggas ain't worth my shells, all y'all niggas tryna do
is hurt my sales, and stop trips to john meneilly
the type to start a beef then run to the cops
when i see you in the street got one in the drop
when i'd rather be on tour getting a hundred a pop
taking pictures with some bitches in front of the drop
the streets is watching


when the, streets is watching
blocks keep clocking
waiting for you to break, make your first mistake
can't ignore it


now it's hard not to kill niggas
it's like a full time job not to kill niggas, can't chill
the streets is watching you when you froze your arms
niggas wanna test you when your gun goes warm
can't get caught with your feet up, gotta keep your heat up
sweet niggas running 'round swearing shit is sweeter
once you're tagged lame, the game is follow the leader
everybody want a piece of your scrilla, so you gotta keep it realer
kidnap niggas wanna steal you
broke niggas want no cash, they just wanna kill ya
for the name, niggas don't know the rules
disrespecting the game, want you to blow your cool
force your hand, of course that man's plotting
smarten up, the streets is watching (it's on)


when the, streets is watching, blocks keep clocking
waiting for you to break, make your first mistake, can't ignore it


my street mentality: flip bricks forever, know me and money
we like armed co-defendants, nigga we stick together
shit whatever for this cheddar ran my game into the ground
hustle harder 'til secret indictment time came around
now you can look up and down the streets and i can't be found
put in 24 hour shifts but, that ain't me now
got a face too easy to trace, niggas mouths got slow leaks
had to hire a team of workers, couldn't play those streets
see out of space like mercury, you jerking me? hectic
had to call upon my wolves to send niggas the message
it said this: "let's play fair and we can stay here;
i'm trying to transform you boys to men like daycare!
hey, there's money to be made!" and niggas got the picture
stopped playing with my paper and, we got richer
then hard times fell upon us, half of my staff had warrants
the other half, in the casket lay dormant
i felt like life was cheating me
for the first time in my life i was getting money but it was like my conscience was eating me
was this a lesson god teaching me? was he saying that
i was playing the game straight from hell from which few came back?
like bad coke, pimp or die, was my mind frame bad?
was niggas thinking simplify was turning cocaine crack?
ain't a whole lot of brain to that, just trying to maintain a stack
and not collide like two trains that's on the same track
but get my life together like the oils i bring back
in the bottom of the pot where no water gets hot
got my transporter take it across the border then stop
to set up shop with a quarter of rock, here's the plan
for three straight weeks, niggas slaughtered the block
but you know the game is food, it fucked up me and my dudes
one drought can wipe a nigga out, faster than the cops
and this unstable way of living just had to stop
half of my niggas got time, we done real things
by '94 became the subject of half of y'all niggas rhymes
public apologies to the families of those caught up in my shit
but that's the life for us lost souls brought up in this shit
the life and times of a demonic mind, excited with crime
and the lavish luxuries that just excited my mind
i figured, "shit, why risk myself? i'll just write it in rhymes
and let you feel me; and if you don't like it, then fine!"
the mind state of a nigga who boosted the crime rate
so high in one city they send national guards to get me
shit, bitch, who's fucking with that? the streets

uh huh, ge-ge ge-ge-geah
ye-ye-yeah, ye-ye-yeah, (brooklyn)
how real is, this?
how real is, this? (brooklyn)
uh-huh huh  (brooklyn)
respect this here, check!


i'm from where the hammers rung, news cameras never come
you and your mans hung in every verse in your rhyme
where the grams was slung, niggas vanish every summer
when the blue vans would come, we throw the work in the can and run
where the plans was to get funds and skate off the set
to achieve this goal quicker, sold all my weight wet
faced with immeasurable odds, still i gave straight bets
so i felt i'm owed something and you nothing, check
i'm from the other side where the other guys don't walk too much
and girls from the projects wouldn't fuck us, said we talked too much
so they ran up to tompkins and sought them dudes to trust
i don't know what the fuck they thought, those niggas is foul just like us
i'm from where the beef is inevitable, summertime's unforgettable
boosters in abundance, buy a half-price sweater new
your word was everything, so everything you said you'd do
you did it, couldn't talk about it if you ain't live it
i'm from where niggas pull your card, and argue all day about
who's the best mcs, biggie, jay-z or nas?
where the drugs czars evolve, and thugs are at odds
at each other's throats for the love of foreign cars
where cats catch cases, hoping the judge r-and-r's
but most times find themselves locked up behind bars, is that all?
i'm from where they ball and breed rhyme stars
i'm from marcy, son, just thought i'd remind y'all


cough up a lung, where i'm from, marcy son, ain't nothing nice
(mentally been many places but i'm brooklyn's own)
cough up a lung, where i'm from, marcy son, ain't nothing nice
(mentally been many places but i'm brooklyn's own)
cough up a lung, where i'm from, marcy son, ain't nothing nice
(mentally been many places but i'm brooklyn's own)
cough up a lung, where i'm from, marcy son, ain't nothing nice
(mentally been many places but i'm brooklyn's own)
cough up a lung, where i'm from, marcy son, ain't nothing nice
(brooklyn... so where you from?)


i'm from the place where the church is the flakiest
and niggas been praying to god so long that they atheist
where you can't put your vest away
and say you'll wear it tomorrow
'cause the day after we'll be saying
"damn, i was just with him yesterday"
i'm a block away from hell
not enough shots away from stray shells
an ounce away from a triple beam
still using a hand-held weight scale
you're laughing, you know the place well
where the liquor stores and the base dwell
and government? fuck government! niggas politick theyselves
where we call the cops the a-team
'cause they hop out of vans and spray things
and life expectancy so low we making out wills at eighteens
where how you get rid of guys who step out of line, your rep solidifies
so tell me when i rap, you think i give a fuck who criticize?
if the shit is lies, god strike me
and i got a question:
are you forgiving guys who live just like me? we'll never know
one day i prayed to you and said if i ever blow, i'd let 'em know
the stakes, and exactly what takes place in the ghetto
promise fulfilled, still i feel my job ain't done
cough up a lung, where i'm from, marcy son, ain't nothing nice


cough up a lung, where i'm from, marcy son, ain't nothing nice
(mentally been many places but i'm brooklyn's own)
cough up a lung, where i'm from, marcy son, ain't nothing nice
(mentally been many places but i'm brooklyn's own)
cough up a lung, where i'm from, marcy son, ain't nothing nice
(mentally been many places but i'm brooklyn's own)
cough up a lung, where i'm from, marcy son, ain't nothing nice
(mentally been many places but i'm brooklyn's own)
cough up a lung, where i'm from, marcy son, ain't nothing nice
(brooklyn... so where you from?)


check, i'm from where they cross-over and clap boards
lost jehovah in place of rap lords, listen
i'm up the block, around the corner and down the street
from where the pimps, prostitutes and the drug lords meet
we make a million off of beats, 'cause our stories is deep
and fuck tomorrow, as long as the night before was sweet
niggas get lost for weeks in the street, twisted off leek
and no matter the weather, niggas know how to draw heat
whether you're four-feet or manute size
it always starts out with three dice and "shoot the five"
niggas thought they deuce was live, then i hit 'em with trips
and i reached down for their money, pa, forget about this
this time around it's platinum, like the shit on my wrist
and this glock on my waist, y'all can't do shit about this
niggas'll show you love, that's how they fool thugs
before you know it, you're lying in a pool of blood
where i'm from


cough up a lung, where i'm from, marcy son, ain't nothing nice
(mentally been many places but i'm brooklyn's own)
cough up a lung, where i'm from, marcy son, ain't nothing nice
(mentally been many places but i'm brooklyn's own)
cough up a lung, where i'm from, marcy son, ain't nothing nice
(mentally been many places but i'm brooklyn's own)
cough up a lung, where i'm from, marcy son, ain't nothing nice
(brooklyn...)

checkin' out this new wine, inhalin' the cork
million miles from the puddles, the rainy days, the tussles
brainy ways to hustle, so we won't get caught
had beef of all sort but i turned it around
chose my steps more wisely, i'm learnin' the ground
i was so gung-ho when i earned my first pound
now it's million dollar deals, (straight) turnin' 'em down
roc-a-fella make or break me, 'til death do us
won't be in your right mind, you ever step to us
been there, when i was in my tenth year, went there
then i realized that it didn't make sense there
backtrack, show me where the cash at

i sink this ball in your hole, i'm tiger woods

when i hit it with this club love you comin' with me
grip you right up under your ass, put your back on the wall
kinda tipsy, seein' triple, so i'm fuckin' y'all all
you remind me of this dream i had the night before
i'm kinda hopin' the condom break to have a reason to go raw
i'm playin', hit the showers, hit the money spot
where all the models play and big money is dropped
drop the top, let her feel the moonlight it entranced her
she jumped all in my seat like some private dancer
i tell you somethin' new, if you don't hop down off that
butter soft shit with your shoes, i'ma step on the gas
she laughed, put her ass back in the proper place
she said, 'i played my cards right and look, i got the ace'
i told her 'bomp *beatboxes*
slow down baby

beyatch! fucka
jigga, '9-7 shit, next millennium
recognize, realize, it's on
roc-a-blok y'all
huh, haha, i'm laughing
it's on



uh-huh uh, yeah
i remember y'all niggas
used to slap box y'all niggas
and smack y'all up, y'all used to see stars
we play corners (?) shit


check it out, you can catch me on top now, playin' a club
throwin' a shot down, tryin' to stay above
ground, another round-breakin' day in the club
surrounded by my own thoughts, playin' a cut
reminiscin' on days i ain't have a pot to piss in
no watch to glisten, no v's with hot systems
missin' my homies that passed right in front of my eyes
due to the fast life we told wonderful lies
on how we would live forever, time proved us wrong
had to get our shit together and move it along
had dreams of being big niggas, jig niggas
drivin' the hottest cars, movin' out with our moms and i'm


thoughts interrupted by this chicken that i used to cluck with
back in the days when i was movin' much shit, "what up chick?"
maintainin', it's the same old thang
a little stress, a little bullshit, ain't too much changed
i see you kept it movin', you see i kept improvin'
she nodded her head in agreement
remember when i used to walk up and down the cement, puttin' it down
knew the 'streets was watching', stay hooded down
just to earn a rep, but what good is it now?
she said, "damn, i just stopped to say hi.... bye"
i was too deep for you from day one
that's why we never had relations, continued in my own zone


i'm wishing on a star to follow where you are
i'm wishing on a dream to follow what it means
and i wish on all the rainbows that i see
i wish on all the people who really dream
and i'm wishing on tomorrow praying it will come
and i'm wishing on all the loving we've ever done (uh-huh)


we used to play tap-tap for rap tracks
run, catch, and kiss in the back park until it got dark
wanted to be like the older males, sneak and drink older champ-ale
dangerous games we played on the third rail
fiend for the summer breeze, hopped out the lee's dungarees
into the hawaiian shorts, relyin' on sports
to take us away from here, but i cut too much
so i had a plan b, used to rhyme with a brush
in the mirror, my siblings used to back me up
like doug e. fresh and ricky d., eric, mickey and me
all my niggas is you with me, each of y'all
let's reach for the stars now... jigga!



throughout my life (uh huh uh huh uh)
no matter what i've done (right)
you've been merciful and your love endureth (yeah)
through all things (yeah)
for that i am eternally grateful


since my date of birth bought you nothing but hurt
play those video games, stole change from ya purse
sat on the cold court bench 'til i was arraigned in ya skirt
saw the pain in ya face, still you maintained a smirk
all you did was motivate me, "don't let 'em hold you back"
what i do? i turned around and i sold you crack
i was a bastard for that, still i'm drowning in shame
just remember one thing now: you're not to blame
you was newly separated tryin' to escape ya world
and through my thirst i didn't help you i just made things worse
i hated me and everybody that created crack
had me thinkin' the newest kicks and the latest gat
still haven't apologized, so please play this back
while i try to come to terms with such a heinous act
you know in more than one way cocaine numbs the brain
all i did was think about how the funds once came
then i ran across this memory and it stung the brain
how can you ever destroy the beauty from which one came
that's a savage, you're the reason
why me and these beats make a marriage
why i rhyme above average and i ain't shit
glad you got yourself together, no thanks to me
strong and beautiful the way thangs should be
you must love me


we used to fight every night but i never would suffer
just smile, my big brother's tryna make me tougher
as we grew fussing and fighting continued
as i plundered through ya stuff and snuck ya clothes to school
got intense, real intense as we got older
never believed it would lead to be poppin' one in your shoulder
where my rings? knew you had it 'cause you took too long
as mickey, annie and the girl that bought it looked on
huffin' and puffin' gun in my hand told you step outside
hoping you said no but you hurt my pride
made our way down the steps
maybe you thought it was just a threat
or maybe ya life was just that crazy
and you was beggin' for death
try to justify this in my young mind
but the adrenaline and my ego hurt combined
drove me berserk, saw the devil in your eyes
high off more than weed
confused, i just closed my young eyes and squeezed (gunshot)
what a sound! opened my eyes just in time
to see ya stumbling to the ground
damn, what the fuck i done now?
runnin' around in a circle thinking i'm assed out
hot gun burnin' my waist, ran straight to jaz' house
like a stranger damn i just shot my nigga
and ran off into the night as if it was not my nigga
left the scene, how could i go out that way?
still you asked to see me in the hospital the next day
you must love me


everything in my power and within my frame
to protect you from this life and keep you away from the game
but you was one of the few people that i can trust
and the fact of the matter i slang these pies for us
you put the pressure on me daily, rarely would you let it go
was a thousand and one times i had to tell you no
but it was one of those days when nobody was around
and i needed emergency trip out of town
searched my mental rolodex for all the numbers i know
as you stared in my face asking me could you go
i agreed said send her everything'll go smooth
just tell her what to do and everything'll go through
strapped her body with them thangs as you boarded the plane
couldn't explain the strange feeling that i caught in the vein
i'm thinking why would i send you when i knew it ain't right
i'm thinking what would make you sacrifice ya life
you must've love me



ha ha
ha ha, roc-a-fella y'all
futuristic shit, bee-atch
uh
what the fuck? how we do
how we do
uh huh, uh huh


it's the eventual triple platinum nigga with the solid gold fade
all that nickle and dime shit, don't hold no weight
fortune 5, top 5 in the forbes (you'll see)
as you thumb through the source, i read the robb report
class c, cold me down with the plastic
that's all i ask of you, like raphael saadiq
at the hotel nikko, robert duvall suite
my people's eyes through the peep hole
i'm loving you down freak, as i
shoot through the city like a rumor
not soon enough, to stop 'em from spreading
the newspaper heading read "jay-z breathes, 80 degrees
only thing to cool him off is a malibu bay breeze"
can't stop for the feds, say cheese
you know they wanna take a nigga picture
pray for the day to get ya, but i'ma parlay, stay richer for now
jigga haven't done dirt in a while
you know my stomach's getting weak from living life on the streets for real
i'm tryna oversee it from suites, ordering eats
at the top where the real criminal minds meet
that's where the cream is (right?!)
that's where your dream is (well ain't it?)


you're only a customer (uh)
when your walkin' in the presence (uh-huh) of hustlers (uh-huh, we spend money all night)
all night long (bee-otch
roc-a-fella y'all, ha ha)
you're only a customer (uh)
when your walkin' (uh) in the presence (uh) of hustlers (uh, spend money all night)
all night long
(roc-a-fella)
(yeah)


ayo my youth had a nigga too aggressive, i
i used to speed excessive, both eyes closed
no thought infested
hitting pot holes, cop-o's'll snatch away what you deem most precious
had to rethink things
is pinky rings worth
life on the run and time served in sing sing?
i don't know to tell the truth, if i'm pressed for dough
gotta consult irv gotti y'all, (heads got to roll)
i was raised to live, lord i pray you forgive
if not, i just handle it like jason kidd
what you're facing is official (it's official)
most cases when i'm blazing won't miss you (won't miss you)
case and point made bullshit a issue, i see it to the end
my writing so personal, my heart bleeding through the pen
make no mistake about me
it's only one nigga living, i got half a cake about me
i got love, i can kill a friend over fam not drugs
and very few people understand that love
to make a nigga die bleeding is nothing (nothing)
you make a motherfucker die breathing then you saying something
beeotch


you're only a customer
when (uh) your walkin' (uh) in the presence (uh) of hustlers (uh, we spend money all night)
all night long (roc-a-fella y'all, ha ha, 
more flavor than y'all can image having
graphic like sega saturn
traffic like the bodega, it just so happens, you caught me at the the tail end of my dirt
brain ain't right from inhaling the work all my life, fuck it
greasy i, had the whole d.c. high, pissy off cristal, 3g high
seasoned bacardi, vvs's blesses my body, we be fresh at the party
play yourself go 'head if you don't know the ledge
it's like spitting to god
get it in your face fucking with niggas over your head
take your time with me, shifty
used to make coke stretch like a sample in a 950
shit with that, while i'm on a kawasaki bike
at the light, doing a pike, with a bitch on the back
and take flight, my life like it was directed by hype
in 35 slow-mo, with the roc-a-fella logo
acapulco to aruba
bay breezes and caviar beluga
very little loot, eludes us
in the grayish blueish l-e-x coupe, it's the root of evil in these people, what the fuck?


you're only a customer
when your walkin' in the presence of hustlers (spend money all night)
all night long (roc-a-fella, uh-huh, uh-huh, bee-otch)
you're only a customer (ah ha)
when your walkin' in the presence (ah ha) of hustlers (spend money all night)
all night long
