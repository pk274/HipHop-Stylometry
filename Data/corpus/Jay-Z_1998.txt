uh-huh
that's right
it was all good just a week ago
uh-huh-uh, it was all good just a week ago
last week i had everything
uh, uh-huh-uh, had this all good just a week ago
i had the money.. had the cars, the bitches
uh-huh, yeah, it was all good just a week ago
and the jewelry..
and then my motherfuckin' niggas started snitchin'
uh-huh, uh uh, yo, yo
beatch!

growin' up in the hood, just my dog and me
we used to hustle in the hood for all to see
problems; i called on him, he called on me
we wasn't quite partners, i hit him off my p
let him unlock doors off my keys
yeah, we spoke, much more than cordially
man, he broke bread with me, my business spread swiftly
the feds came to get me, we both fled quickly
wasn't quick enough to jump over the hedges with me
got caught, and that's when our relationship strayed
used to call me from the joint 'til he ran out of change
and when he called collect and i heard his name
i quickly accepted, but when i reached the phone
he's talkin' reckless, i can sense deceit in his tone
i said: "damn, dog! what, nine weeks and you're home?"
he said: "main man, you think shit's sweet 'cause you're home."
i just sat, spat no more speech in the phone
them crackers up there bleachin' your dome, you're reachin'
i said: "the world don't stop, i got to keep, keep on."
from there i sensed the beef was on
i ran to the spy store to add some more features on my phone
to see if i had bugs and leeches on my phone
can't be too safe, â€˜cause niggas is two-faced
and they show the other side, when they catch a new case
it's on


it was cool when you had hella weed to smoke
and you bought a new home where you could keep the folks
i don't see how this side of you could be provoked
uh-huh, uh-huh, it was all good just a week ago
funny what seven days can change
a stand up nigga, now you sit down to aim
used to have a firm grip, now you dropping names
it was all good just a week ago


like i put the toast to your head and made you sell
we both came in this game, blind as hell
i did a little better, had more clientele
told you put away some cheddar, now you cryin' for bail
seventeen and i'm holdin' on to around a mill'
i could bail out, blow trial and come around on appeal
had niggas thinkin' i was from uptown for real
i had so much hustle, plus i was down to ill
like a brooklyn nigga, straight out of brownsville
down and dirty, down to fight to round 30
freezin' on them corners, still holdin' my crack
lookin' up and down the block, the fuck is the dough at?
came from flat broke to lettin' the dough stack
you tell them feds i said: "i'm never going back"
i'm from marcy, and marcy don't raise no rats
you know the consequences of your acts, you can't be serious


it was cool when you had hella weed to smoke
and you bought a new home where you could keep the folks
i don't see how this side of you could be provoked
uh-huh, uh-huh, it was all good just a week ago
funny what seven days can change
a stand up nigga, now you sit down to aim
used to have a firm grip, now you dropping names
shit was all good just a week ago


the lawyer i retained you said you leakin' some things
all this after a week in the bing
i'm mad at myself, 'cause i didn't spot the weakling
i would've bet the house you wouldn't speak a thing
nigga, this was the oath, to the top or broke
even pricked our finger, anything that got between us
we supposed to cock the ninas, what happened to that?
instead you copped out to a misdemeanor
fuck it, the same thing make you laugh make you cry (that's right)
the same game that make you math could make you die
(that's life) it's a dice game, and sometimes you crap
who would've thought you'd get popped one time and rat?
now you know that's bad when your sister is mad
and your son gotta grow up, like, "this is my dad?"
the labeling of a snitch is a lifetime scar
you'll always be in jail, nigga, just minus the bars


it was cool when you had hella weed to smoke
and you bought a new home where you could keep the folks
i don't see how this side of you could be provoked
uh-huh, uh-huh, it was all good just a week ago
funny what seven days can change
a stand up nigga, now you sit down to aim
used to have a firm grip, now you dropping names
it was all good just a week ago


shit is crazy man
all these niggas out here snitchin'
we was one step away from takin' this crack money
and recyclin' it through the ghettos
and buildin' back up our own hoods
now all you niggas start snitchin' on each other
i got partners doin' 15-20
wouldn'ta been doin' shit
if you didn't snitch, beatch!
it's about time y'all check that shit out man

gots to lock it down and when they rush -- part two
cocaine whiter now
operation is sweet
whole game tighter now
moving a brick a week
plus a nigga price is down
we them niggas to see
time to start the arising now
i don't know what's wrong with bleek


it seems, i'm like keenan, picking up on the vibe
that he ain't too happy, i could just see it in his eyes
i don't know if it's the chicks or how we dividing the loot
time to pay his ass a visit 'fore he decide to get cute
jumped out like a star with the flavest car
matching the gator shirt, softer than my next door neighbors
these young niggas think i fell out the loop
'cause the last time they seen me hopping out the coupe
i hopped out in a suit
look at this nigga jay fronting, trying to take my shine
i didn't say this verbally, just had some shit on my mind
plus i'm puffing like an ounce more than i used to puff
taking advice from these niggas but they ain't used to stuff
they had me thinking, "shit, i'm the one that moved the stuff
while he drive around town in brand new coupes and stuff"
swear to god, they had me practically hating his guts
as he approached i spoke, "jigga, whattup?"


i done came up (uhh), put my life on the line (uhh)
soaked the game up (yeah), now it's my time to shine
time to change up (what?), no more second in line
nine-eight, these streets is mine
(uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh-uh-huh-uh-huh)


look at that fake smile he just gave me, it's breaking my heart
should i school him or pull the tools out and just break him apart?
i felt his hatred it was harsh -- 'fore this faking shit start
i should take him in back of the building and blaze him
uh-oh, this nigga jay, he ain't slow, he musta picked up on the vibe
but had i not been so high, i woulda been able to hide
tried to cover up myself, as i gave him a five
hugged him as if i loved him, to the naked eye
it woulda seemed we was the closest, but to those that know us
could see that something was about to go down
stay focused, i'm trying to concentrate
but it's like he's reading my mind
as if he can see through this fog and all this weed in my mind
could he see i had plans on, being the man
ever since we first spoke and he put that g in my hand
and i gave it back to show him, i was down for the cause
as he approached ("whattup bleek?") and i paused


i done came up (uhh), put my life on the line (uhh)
soaked the game up (yeah), now it's my time to shine
time to change up (what?), no more second in line
nine-eight, these streets is mine
yeah, you done came up (uhh), put your life on the line (uhh)
soaked the game up (uhh), now it's yo' time to shine (yeah)
time to change up, no more second in line
nine-eight, these streets is mine


right, yo we wild out in vegas, styled on haters
mouthed off at the cops, outta cranberry drops
copped whips the same color, we tighter than brothers
with different fathers but same mothers, this life don't love us
so 'til death do us, i'm never breaking my bond
nigga, we lex movers, v-12 pushers
as i stand
one leg of my pants up, in a stance like, "and what?"
i know these niggas are feeding my mind cancer
but in time's the answer (woo!)
seems mind-blowing, this weed and hennessy
got my mind going, trust me nigga, i'm knowing
chicks used to ignore me
and my aunt saying i need 50, not 60/40
oh god, don't let him control y'all
your gun is my gun, your clip is my clip, baby
your fun is my fun (uh huh), your bitch is my bitch
any nigga trying to harm jay, i'm feeling for you
i ain't only touching you, i'm killing your crew
give it a year, you'll be sitting on a million or two
records sold, nigga, perfect your role, geah


i done came up (uhh), put my life on the line
soaked the game up (yeah), now it's my time to shine
time to change up (what?), no more second in line
nine-eight, these streets is mine (geah, geah)
i done came up (came up), put your life on the line (uhh)
soaked the game up (game up), now it's yo' time to shine
time to change up (change up), no more second in line
nine-eight, these streets is mine

soaked the game up, now it's yo' time to shine
time to change up, no more second in line
yeah, yeah
coming of age two, brand new

back again and back again
i went from marcy to hollywood
and back again, and back again


as a youth i used to hold the weed up
old heads said i thought more like a soldier than a leader
in order to succeed i had to slow my speed up
didn't listen to stuff took another puff of the cheeba
they said believe us or not trust is something you earn
with every mistake you make back to us you return
probably would go hollywood i thought he was joking
my first taste of fame i hit the first thing smoking
all engulfed into honies, the pussy was tight
if she threw the pussy right, i got mushy like
damn baby i love you take all my cash
"you ain't got to lie jay," you already gettin' the ass
she loved that i was a thug it turned her on
soon as i got soft, it turned her off
i got relaxed put my feet up start dissing my friends
and that's when the ceiling fell in


i went from marcy to hollywood
and back again, and back again
i went from marcy to hollywood
and back again, and back again


i came through with the shines
like the streets was blind
didn't master my algebra, no caliber
stick me? i was thinking how and for what
but reality bites like a thousand mutts
nothing worse than the person that's foul with guts
to stick you quicker...


from marcy to hollywood
and back again, and back again
from marcy to hollywood
and back again, and back again


i went from marcy to hollywood
and back again, back again
from marcy to hollywood
and back again, back again


uh huh uh geah since y'all niggas don't like to think
i'ma make it real easy for y'all
you got three different types of nigga
first cat, as a youth is real wild
for whatever reason he hit the money or whateverâ€”cooled out
you got one cat that's ghetto, grimy always remained ghetto
you know that type
then, you got one cat very smart young man
e'rybody wanted him to be a lawyer doctor whatever
pressure drove him crazy, he wiled out, ha geah...
...marcy to hollywood
and back again, and back again
back again, beatch

take the bass line out
uh-huh, jigga
uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh, yeah
let it bump though


it's the hard knock life for us
it's the hard knock life for us
instead of treated, we get tricked
instead of kisses, we get kicked
it's the hard knock life!


from standin' on the corners, boppin'
to drivin' some of the hottest cars new york has ever seen
from droppin' some of the hottest verses rap has ever heard
from the dope spot, with the smoke glock
fleein' the murder scene, you know me well
from nightmares of a lonely cell, my only hell
but since when y'all niggas know me to fail? fuck naw
where all my niggas with the rubber grips, bust shots
and if you with me, mama, rub on your tits, and what-not
i'm from the school of the hard knocks, you must not
let outsiders violate our blocks and my plot
let's stick up the world and split it 50/50, uh-huh
let's take the dough and stay real jiggy, uh-huh
and sip the cris' and get pissy-pissy
flow infinitely like the memory of my nigga biggie, baby!
you know it's hell when i come through
the life and times of shawn carter, nigga, volume 2
y'all niggas get ready!


it's the hard knock life for us
it's the hard knock life for us
instead of treated, we get tricked
instead of kisses, we get kicked
it's the hard knock life!


i flow for those 'dro'ed out
all my niggas locked down in the 10 by four, controllin' the house
we live in hard knocks
we don't take over, we borrow blocks
burn 'em down and you can have it back
daddy, i'd rather that
i flow for chicks wishin', they ain't have to strip to pay tuition
i see your vision, mama
i put my money on the longshots
all my ballers that's born to clock
know i'ma be on top whether i perform or not
i went from lukewarm to hot
sleepin' on futons and cots to king size
green machines, to green 5's
i've seen pies, let the thing between my eyes analyze life's ills
then i put it down type braille
i'm tight grill with the phony
rappers, y'all might feel we homies
i'm like, "still, y'all don't know me."
shit, i'm tight grill when my situation ain't improvin'
i'm tryna murder everything movin' â€“ feel me?


it's the hard knock life for us
it's the hard knock life for us
instead of treated, we get tricked
instead of kisses, we get kicked
it's the hard knock life!
it's the hard knock life for us
it's the hard knock life for us
instead of treated, we get tricked
instead of kisses, we get kicked
it's the hard knock life!


i don't know how to sleep, i gotta eat, stay on my toes
got a lotta beef, so logically, i prey on my foes
hustlin' is still inside of me, and as far as progress
you'd be hard-pressed to find another rapper hot as me
i gave you prophecy on my first joint, and y'all lamed out
didn't really appreciate it 'til the second one came out
so i stretched the game out, etched your name out
put jigga on top and dropped albums non-stop for ya, nigga!


it's the hard knock life for us
it's the hard knock life for us
instead of treated, we get tricked
instead of kisses, we get kicked
it's the hard knock life!

come on... life... death...

when it's real say word to shawn, my niggas
if i should die...


don't cry, my niggas, it's been one hell of a ride, my niggas
in the middle of the drought, i flipped pies, my niggas
i did joints with mary j. blige, my niggas
i've eluded the coppers, got booted with big poppa
skated through with the caesar picadas
at high school got head by the lockers
gassed the baddest girl in the class to show me her knockers
rocked jewels, dropped school, still didn't fail
rhymes still written well, hold court in the street
never sit in the cell for a second then i'm gettin' my bail
shoot it out with the bounty hunters
fuck sittin' in the county for summers if they should down me
everybody around us become one for that day
to live life get your shit right and play
don't get it twisted like braids, if i'm missed it's okay
but life's short, don't miss a day, uhh


if i should die, don't cry, my niggas
just ride, my niggas, bust bullets in the sky, my niggas
and when i'm gone don't mourn, my niggas
get on, my niggas
when it's real say word to shawn, my niggas
if i should die...


... don't cry, my niggas
just ride, my niggas, bust bullets in the sky, my niggas
and when i'm gone don't mourn, my niggas
get on, my niggas
when it's real say word to shawn, my niggas
if i should die...


i'd tell big they're still hearin' his songs
run into pac ask him where we went wrong
tell him life is miserable when ya dealin' in the physical form
is everything that's invisible gone?
i need to know, will i still feel pain or will it be ironic?
will i chill in the flames for all the ills of my brain?
can i re, veal the game to all the hustlers
trapped in the race and if so can i leave this place?
can i puff cigars and drink cristal?
if this is heaven to me is this considered heavenly?
can i still touch lives, answer their "whats and whys"
make sure everybody in my fam' clutch five?
if i should die... don't cry, my niggas

yeah, uh-huh, watch this y'all

'cause i'm like that y'all, yeah
i'm really like that


as a young'un, dumb and gun in the waist
sold crack to those who couldn't take the pain
and had to numb it with base
couldn't drink the henny straight, i needed somethin to chase
nowadays i throw shots back, leavin' nothin' to waste
life's like a treadmill, niggas runnin' in place
gettin' nowhere fast, a whole year done past
i vowed to never stop winnin', 'til the earth stop spinnin'
rock hot linen, cop hot cars and hot women
if it's not him then you got it confused, y'all not rememberin'
my motto is, simply "i will not lose!"
abide by the block rules, i buy my glocks used
with bodies on it, let me know anybody want it?
i'm raised, irrational, ways misunderstood
if you ain't live like i live, then one with the hood
i done what i could, to come up with this paper 'til this day still
run with the hood, guess it's part of my nature
if hell awaits a, nigga i'm comin' with the razors
still flashin' ya shit, try to pass me in a six
type classy on the wrist, every bit of 30 karats
this is, not a game this is not why i came
may these words find a spot on your brain and burn
then i recycle my life, i shall return

9-6, futuristic shit, bee-atch
uh
what the fuck? how we do
how we do, uh-huh, uh-huh


it's the eventual triple platinum nigga with the solid gold fade
all that nickle and dime shit, don't hold no weight
fortune 5, top 5 in the forbes (you'll see)
as you thumb through the source, i read the robb report
class c, cold me down with the plastic
that's all i ask of you, like raphael saadiq
at the hotel nikko, robert duvall suite
my people's eyes through the peep hole
i'm loving you down freak, as i
shoot through the city like a rumor
not soon enough, to stop 'em from spreading
the newspaper heading read "jay-z breathes, 80 degrees
only thing to cool him off is a malibu bay breeze"
can't stop for the feds, say cheese
you know they wanna take a nigga picture
pray for the day to get ya but i'ma parlay, stay richer for now
jigga haven't done dirt in a while
you know my stomach's getting weak from living life on these streets for real
tryna oversee it from suites, ordering eats
at the top where the real criminal minds meet
that's where the cream is (right?!)
that's where your dream is (well ain't it?)


you're only a customer
when your walkin' in the presence (uh-huh) of hustlers (uh-huh, spend money all night)
(all night long) (bee-otch
roc-a-fella y'all, ha ha)
you're only a customer (uh)
when your walkin' (uh) in the presence (uh) of hustlers (uh, spend money all night)
(all night long)
(roc-a-fella)
(yeah)


ayo my youth had a nigga too aggressive, i
i used to speed excessive, both eyes closed
no thought infested
hitting pot holes, cop-o's'll snatch away what you deem most precious
had to rethink things
is pinky rings worth
life on the run and time served in sing sing?
i don't know to tell the truth, if i'm pressed for dough
gotta consult irv gotti y'all, (heads got to roll)
i was raised to live, lord i pray you forgive
if not, i just handle it like jason kidd
what you're facing is official (it's official)
most cases when i'm blazing won't miss you (won't miss you)
case and point made bullshit a issue, i see it to the end
my writing so personal, my heart bleeding through the pen
make no mistake about me
it's only one nigga living, i got half a cake about me
i got love, i can kill a friend over fam not drugs
and very, few people understand that love
to make a nigga die bleeding is nothing (nothing)
you make a motherfucker die breathing then you saying something
beeotch


you're only a customer
when (uh) your walkin' (uh) in the presence (uh) of hustlers (uh-huh, spend money all night)
(all night long) (roc-a-fella y'all, ha ha)
you're only a customer
when (ah ha) your walkin' in the presence (ah ha) of hustlers (spend money all night)
(all night long) (roc-a-fella)
(uh-huh)
you're only a customer (yea)
when your walkin' (huh) in the presence (huh) of hustlers (huh, spend money all night)
(all night long)
(roc-a-fella)


more flavor than y'all can image having
graphic like sega saturn
traffic like the bodega, just so happens, you caught me at the the tail end of my dirt
brain ain't right from inhaling the work all my life, fuck it
greasy i, had the whole d.c. high, pissy off cristal, 3g high
seasoned bacardi, vvs's blesses my body
we be fresh at the party, play yourself go 'head if you don't know the ledge
it's like spitting to god
get it in the face fucking with niggas over your head
take your time with me, shifty
used to make coke stretch like a sample in the 950
shit with that, while i'm on a kawasaki bike
at the light, doing a pike, with a bitch on the back
and take flight, my life like it was directed by hype
in 35 slow-mo, with the roc-a-fella logo
acapulco to aruba
bay breezes and caviar beluga
very little loot, eludes us
in the grayish blueish l-e-x coupe, it's the root of evil in these people, what the fuck?


you're only a customer
walkin' in the presence of hustlers
(all night long) (spend money all night)
(roc-a-fella, uh huh, uh huh, beeotch)
you're only a customer (ah ha)
walkin' in the presence (ah ha) of hustlers (spend money all night)
(all night long) (roc-a-fella, uh-huh, uh-huh)

and if you wanna get down, all you gotta invest
is your time, i gotta move this in a week or less
for the next couple of days i brought out all i possess
the rolex, necklaces with the vvs
between the driver and the passenger where the tv rest
for my top draft picks i cop the new gs
now all the little soldiers wanna roll with my team
cause i ain't sold em a dream, i just showed 'em the cream
picked em up in the afternoons and told 'em some things
you know the regular shit you do when you molding them teens
yo, never lay your head where you holding them things
keep the family then your business, nothing goes in between
never feared no man, put four in his bean
drop your gun then, blow the scene, ya heard me?

i don't care about your block and whoever you shot
i don't care about your album and whenever it drop
i don't care about your past if i did i woulda asked

far as this rap shit, i'm ten steps ahead of niggas
shooting backwards, just for practice
ride or die nigga, hopping in your casket
'bout to go to hell with you, blow the l with you
tell the whole world i'm spitting, let 'em know the shells hit you

you belong to the night (uh-uhh-uh, ge-ge-geyeah)
in the river of darkness
he's a man of the night


what the deal, playboy? just rest your soul
i be holding it down yo, still love the dough
got these ladies on the cock now, you know how we go
got the whole world on lock down, you know how we flow
don't worry about brooklyn, i continue to flame
therefore a world with amnesia won't forget your name
you held it down long enough, let me take those reigns
and just like your spirit, the commission remains
niggas can cross the t's and, dot the i's
now that i got too popular to cop them pies
i'm taking this rap shit serious, to my demise
jay shit's like cake mix, watch me rise
basics in the basement, wasted
asking my dog for advice so when he can't say shit
my hatred is, fueled just give me a sign
and i let the world know that the city is mine, what?


you belong to the city (the city is mine, what-what-what)
you belong to the night (ge-ge-geyeah, uh-uhh-uh, pa-pau)
in the river of darkness
he's a man of the night (the city is mine, that's right...)


y'all wanna know how i flow just seek and you find
i'm like a brain in the voice box, i speak my mind
about to redefine rap mami, either i'm
the illest nigga doing it or these niggas is losing it
i read a article that said i was ruining shit
but every time i look, i'm moving units in quick
so i'ma hit y'all, with these last two and split
and leave niggas with nothing but my influences-es
students of jigga, i ain't mad yeah, bite my shit
sell half of what i sell because it's not quite my shit
i'm the type to buy a rollie and just ice my shit
on the spot, fuck coming back twice to shit
how real is that? my floss game, still intact
boss game, you lame dudes can't feel that
like the first dude to cop the 850 in '89
and drove it up to 55th, the city is mine, what?


you belong to the city (the city is mine)
you belong to the night (yeah, uhh, the city is mine)
in the river of darkness (pa-pause, feel me)
he's a man of the night (yeah, yeah, bounce, bounce)


i snatch your girl 'cause your arm ain't strong enough
plus y'all don't stay in the studio long enough
i make hits while y'all stay hating and take bricks
had it locked 'til i came in the club, take 6
got your chick 'cause you swore she was innocent
got her a chinese manicure, hair done by dominicans, all for what
so i could be in a dark corner, all in her butt
at the bar alchoholing her up
i represent the lifestyle of those who thirst cream
a buck fifty a shot, louis the thirteenth
jay-z, roc-a-fella yo, know the name
i ain't a player, get it right, i'm controlling the game
from now until they blow holes in my frame
i'ma stand firm, holding my aim, feel me?
i'm the focal, point like biggie in his prime
on the low thoughâ€”shhh! the city is mine


you belong to the city (uh-huh, yeah, the city is mine)
you belong to the night (ah ah, the city is mine)
in the river of darkness (feel me, the city is mine)
he's the man of the night (the city is mine, is mine, is mine, is mine)
you belong to the city
you belong to the night
in the river of darkness
he's the man of the night



i'm what the game made me
not what the fame made me
no amount of money can change me
i'm what you lames can't be
live nigga what? live as fuck


check, live from the 7-1-8
either respect the flow or learn your lesson from your wake
i'm wishin arthritis on all writers who, knock my hustle
how can y'all understand the struggle?
it's hard to live, when you got greedy niggas in the mix
knowin i outclass three-e niggas in the six
so i outblast til it's empty clips
and i outlast niggas, survival of the fit
one life, i gotta make sure it's done right
cause them yet to have a conversation bout reincarnation
ball out, until i fall out
stick thick chicks, try to tear they wall out
hard to think about your future with, nothin to gain
hard to concentrate on school with stomach pain
life's harsh, i know y'all runnin from 'caine
but it'll only catch you and track you down
with no deal, who you gonna rap to now?
start your own record company, that's profound
live niggas gonna rumble when you backs on the wall
jive niggas gonna crumble and fall


i'm what the game made me
not what the fame made me
no amount of money can change me
i'm what you lames can't be
live nigga what? live as fuck
