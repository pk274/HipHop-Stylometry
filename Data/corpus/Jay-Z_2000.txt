spitting up in the pacifics, smoking spliffs in the shade
she used to love you, but she feeling different today
you used to smother her. look at your honey slipping away
consorting with hustlers, niggas that be giving her space
she said she feel free when she's around me
i'm letting her do her and, in turn, she's doing me

the theme song to the sopranos
plays in the key of life on my mental piano
got a strange way of seeing life, like
i'm stevie wonder with beads under the do-rag
intuition is there, even when my vision's impaired, yeah
knowing i can go just switching a spare
on the highway of life, nigga, it's sharp in my sight, oh!
keen senses ever since i was a teen on the benches
every time somebody like ennis was mentioned
i would turn green—me, being in the trenches
him, living adventurous, not worrying about expenditures
i'm braving temperatures below zero, no hero
no father figure; you gotta pardon a nigga
but i'm starving, my niggas, and the weight loss in my figure
is starting to darken my heart, 'bout to get to my liver
watch it, my niggas; i'm trying to be calm but i'm gon' get richer
through any means with that thing that malcolm palmed in the picture
never read the qu'ran or islamic scriptures
only psalms i read was on the arms of my niggas
tattooed, so i carry on like i'm nonreligious
clap whoever stand between shawn and figures
niggas say it's the dawn, but i'm superstitious
shit is as dark as it's been, nothing has gone as you predicted
i move with biscuits, stop the heart of niggas acting too suspicious
this is food for thought—you do the dishes!

jigga, vol. 2 bitch

my pistals never miss-trial, here's the determent
with no chance of parole, bullets coming concurrent (boo-ka, boo-ka, boo-ka)
i'm like "why, nigga? try jigga" you must remember
it's like being on trial for your life with a public defender
let the jury fill the seats up, and start the court calendar off
with docket number 9mm, all rise, the honorable jay-z presides
instead of a mallet, i hold a tool, all objections over-ruled
save your opening arguments, hope you understanding
two guns, right over left, that's how i cross-examine
like tom cruise, pop 'em with the top gun, you lose
jigga's no lie, and y'all can't handle the truth

when you blow trial ain't no coming back on the pill
it's murder one, bail set at a half a mil'
it's murder one, for you backwards motherfuckers: red-rum
commit hate crimes; fake rhymes, i hold in contempt
you get state time for faking like you greater than him
so cop a plea to lesser charges
pay your fine at the desk sergeant (ugh, uh-huh)
say you're sorry, then take your property
i be sho' defended, flow splendid, no co-defendant
while you niggas hold trial with no motions in it
three-time felon, third album, locking it down for the term
of lifetime, vol. 2, nigga, court is adjourned


fuck the judge, fuck the jury, when you're warring with me

you're my best friend's sister, grown woman and all
but you see how i am around girls; i ruin 'em all
plus your mom call me son, around you since i was small
shit, i watched you mature, nah, this ain't right
but still when your boyfriend ditched you, life's a bitch you cried
over my right shoulder, i told you to wipe your eyes
take your time when you likin' a guy
'cause if he sense that your feelings too intense, his pimp'll die
i bought you earrings on your birthday
drove you to college your first day
it must be sad, though it hurts to say
we could never be a item, don't even like him
you deserve better, this is ugly; gina, please don't love me
there's better guys out there other than me
(you need a lawyer or a doctor or somebody like that, you know?)
like a lawyer or a doctor with a ph.d
think of how upset your mother and brother would be
if they found that you was huggin' me
my conscience is fuckin' with me


let him hold you, let him touch you
soon you'll understand
let him hold you, let him touch you
soon you'll understand

we're tryin', really tryin' to make it work
i'm young, and i ain't ready, and i told you


it ain't like, i ain't tell you from day one, i ain't shit
when it comes to relationships, i don't have the patience
now it's too late, we got a little life together
and in my mind i really want you to be my wife forever
but in the physical it's like i'ma be trife forever
a different girl every night forever; told you to leave
but your stubborn and you love him and
no matter what, despite all the fuckin' and the cheatin'
you still won't leave him, now you're grievin'
and i feel bad, believe me
but i'm young and i ain't ready, and this ain't easy
wasn't fair to tell you to wait, so i told you to skate
you chose not to, now look at the shit we gotta go through
don't wanna fight, don't wanna fuss
you the mother of my baby
i don't want you to hate me, this is about us
rather me; i ain't ready to be what you want me to be
and 'cause i love you, i want you to leave, please

daddy left; i, i thought i was makin' things better
i made it worse


dear ma, i'm in the cell, lonely as hell
writin' this scribe, thinkin' 'bout how you must feel inside
you tried to teach me better, but i refused to grow
goddamn, i ain't the young man that you used to know
you said the street claim lives, but i wanted things like
bling-bling ice; i was wrong in hindsight
shit, we grew apart, try to blame it on your new spouse
i know it hurt like hell the day you kicked me out
but your house is your house, i ain't respect the rules
i brought crack past your door, beefed with rival crews
and who wants to be the mother of a son who sold drugs?
co-workers saw me on the corner slingin' larry love
meanwhile, you workin' hard, like 2 or 3 jobs
tryin' to feed me and my siblings, makin' an honest livin'
who am i kiddin'? i, call myself easin' the load
i made the load heavy, i need money for commissary

'til you heard the cries of my mama, me giving her drama
told her i ain't promised tomorrow, gotta live for the day
and before she could say jay...
i was out the door, pouch full of raw, a outlaw mentality

and get the camcorder to camcord their hand movements
and for what? y'all actin' like y'all better than hov
y'all niggas should open up for the letterman show
