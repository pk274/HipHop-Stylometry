doin' what we like to do, our way
eyes behind shades
this necklace the reason all of my dates been blind dates
but today i got my thoroughest girl with me
i'm mashin' the gas, she's grabbin' the wheel, it's trippy
how hard she rides with me, the new bobby and whitney
only time we don't speak is durin' sex and the city
she gets carrie fever, but soon as the show's over
she's right back to being my soldier
'cause mami's a rider and i'm a roller
put us together, how they gon' stop both us?
whatever she lacks i'm right over her shoulder (woo)
when i'm off track, mami is keepin' me focused
so let's lock this down like it's supposed to be
the '03 bonnie and clyde: hov' and b, holla

(me and my girlfriend)
down to ride 'til the very end, is me and my boyfriend
(me and my boyfriend, that's right)
all i need in this life of sin is me and my girlfriend
(me and my girlfriend, look for me)
down to ride 'til the very end, is me and my boyfriend
(me and my boyfriend)


the problem is, you dudes treat the one that you lovin'
with the same respect that you treat the one that you humpin'
that ain't 'bout nothin', if ever you mad about somethin'
it won't be that, oh no, it won't be that
i don't be at places where we comfy at
with no be-atch, oh no, you won't see that
and no, i ain't perfect, nobody walkin' this earth's surface is
but girlfriend, work with the kid
i keep you workin' that hermès birkin bag
manolo blahnik timbs, aviator lens
six hundred drops, mercedes benz
the only time you wear burberry to swim
and i don't have to worry, only worry is him
she do anything necessary for him
and i do anything necessary for her
so don't let the necessary occur, yep


all i need in this life of sin is me and my girlfriend
(me and my girlfriend)
down to ride 'til the very end, is me and my boyfriend
(me and my boyfriend, that's right)
all i need in this life of sin is me and my girlfriend
(me and my girlfriend, look for me)
down to ride 'til the very end, is me and my boyfriend
(me and my boyfriend, talk to 'em, b)


if i was your girlfriend (uh, uh, uh-huh)
i'll be there for you (woo, uh)
if somebody hurts you (uh)
even if that somebody was me (woo, that's hot)
yeah-hee (uh, break it down for 'em, b)
sometimes i trip on how happy we could be (take 'em outside)
and so i put this on my life (woo, uh)
nobody or nothing will ever come between us (woo, uh, woo)
and i promise i'll give my life (woo, i'm dancin', woo)
my love and my trust if you was my boyfriend (one more time)
put this on my life (uh, uh, uh)
the air that i breathe in, all that i believe in (woo, uh)
i promise i'll give my life (woo)
my love and my trust if you was my boyfriend (uh, uh)


all i need in this life of sin is me and my girlfriend
(me and my girlfriend)
down to ride 'til the very end, is me and my boyfriend
(me and my boyfriend, that's right)
all i need in this life of sin is me and my girlfriend
(me and my girlfriend)
down to ride 'til the very end, is me and my boyfriend
(me and my boyfriend)

i'm so far ahead of my time i'm 'bout to start another life
look behind you; i'm 'bout to pass you twice
back to the future, gotta slow up for the present; i'm fast
niggas can't get past my past
how you propose a deal with the perfect present?
when i unwrap the gift & the curse in one session?
ain't no living person can test him
only two resting in heaven can be mentioned in the same breath as him
7 straight summers; critics might not admit it
but nobody in rap did it quite like i did it;
if you did, i done it before
you get it, i had it;
i got mad at it, i don't want it no more
and that comes from everything, from flippin' that raw
flippin' whores, flippin' vocal cords
don't get it twisted, get it right
did it different, did it better, did it nice
did the impossible, and then i did it twice
young!


young h.o., fresh from italy
trip financed by my best ability
same one helped me in extra realty
for my mom, for my nephews, a bunch of lil' me's
flip flop by versace, hip-hop got me here
music made me a millionaire, yeah
multi for what's inside of here
inside my heart, besides that, i'm smart
prepare poems with a passion, at the same time cash in
took the best of both worlds minus the madness
though controversy follows me everywhere i dock
everything i hear i block
out like the jealous clouds do the sun
then i sit back and recline since my shine has shone
and then sure nuff bust out something foreign with the doors up
maybe the lilac porsche
the lavender retriever
i only bring my homies back purple reefer
i only smoke in ibiza
in capri, somewhere foreign that you need your visa, yup
hovi's home but it's like i never left, i had the global phone, yup
yeah i stayed in touch, i heard y'all back home complaining, y'all complain too much
so hateful, bunch of dudes i put on out there acting so ungrateful but
daddy's home and he brought the forty autie-matie chrome
for all the chatty-chatty y'all been doing


while y'all was running your mouth complaining about summer jam
i was in flip-flops in the south of france
see how it flip-flops with the number one station for hip-hop and r&b?
you thought summer jam was starring you? it was starring me
even in my absence, my presence is felt
that gotta tell you i'm the king, dog, if nothing else
i'm on another continent, you still ain't content
i'm in the mediterranean, you still ain't vent
explain to me why i wanna be you again
you on the radio crying, i'm learning to swim

uhh, yeah, uh-uhh-uh
uh-huh, uh-uh-uhh, uhh, uhh
i ain't tryin to be rude dude
but give a nigga some space
i ain't tryin to be rude dude

i ain't got time to waste (check it)


why is you over here lookin' at me
while all these girls up in here?

y'all don't want me to spray the semi in here
i mean if you a fan i consider you fam'
but shake a nigga hand, well shit god damn
all that ("do you remember me dawg?") nah i'm drawin' a blank
you got me feelin like a fish, in a fish tank
just think, if you came to a club
tryin to find a little hon for some one-night love
'stead you got another nigga all up in your mug
you make me uncomfortable thug, go thatta-way!
and kill the ice grill holmes
'cause i keep enough heat to melt that away
i came in some sweats, i came to get met
tryin' to find a chick that make it hard for me to "next!"
we exit stage left, hop in her lexus
treat me like a baby, mouth on her breast-es
may i suggest that it's
a lot of long-legged chicks in short-ass dresses
go find you one
go get your dance on, go grind on one, damn

i ain't tryin' to hear about your guts and glory
i'm tryin' to hear b.i.g. and some cuts from n.o.r.e
and you keep talkin' over the beat like clue ("do you remember?")
go find somethin' to do
you're a janitor, go find somethin' to screw

this here's a ballad for all the fallen soldiers (this ain't music)
i'm 'bout to show you how a hustler's life (this is life man)
and a soldier's life parallel
and the one thing they got in common is a mother's pain
(forget about music for a second)
picture a split screen (forget musicians)
on one side, you got a hustler getting ready for the block
(human beings)
other side, you got a soldier getting ready for boot camp
(people, it's life)
they're both at war, stay with us


you lost him mama, the war's calling him
feel it's his duty to fall in line with all of them
he's a soldier
rose through the ranks as the head of your household
now it's time to provide bank, like he's supposed to
now just remember why he's gone 'til november
it's part of him growing up
his shirt soaks up your tears as he holds ya
your heart beating so fast, speeding his pulse up
yeah, i know it sucks, life ain't all rosebuds
a couple of speed bumps, you gotta take your lumps
off to boot camp, the world's facing terror
bin laden been happening in manhattan
crack was anthrax back then, back when
police was al'qaeda to black men
while i was out there hustling, sinning with no religion
he was off to war, killing for a living


days turn to nights, nights turn to years
years turn to "how the fuck we make it in here?"
my barracks average couple fights a day
get you locked in a hole, won't see the light of day
and i feel like i'm just writing my life away
i never thought shit could end up quite this way
there's a war going on outside no man is safe from
i'm here for the good fight, only the fakes run
i'm here for the purple heart, if i can't take one
for my team or my siblings, what's my reason for living?
i love my niggas more than anything else
this war's about my family, me needing the wealth
you don't understand how useless as men we felt
'til you become a five-star general
shout out to my niggas that's locked in jail
p.o.ws that's still in the war for real, for real


your baby boy is getting grown
so your baby boy is moving on
(i've gotta chase it) i'm gon' chase it
(and i'm gon' make it, yeah) i'ma make it
your baby boy is getting grown
so your baby boy is moving on
(i'm gonna make it) i'm gon' make it
(even if i gotta chase it) you gotta take it
woo, yeah


mama say a prayer, your son's becoming a man
this war's taxing to him like uncle sam
he ain't gon' always make the right choice, understand
every choice that he make, he make 'em for his fam
it's death before dishonor
and if he's gone, you should honor his memory
don't cry, we all gon' die eventually
but if he's locked in the penitentiary, send him some energy
they all winners to me, what's up emory?



ohh, ooh, ohh
uh, uh, uh
it—it—it was all a dream
last night i had a dream
thoughts was racing through my head (it was all a dream)
felt so real to me (it was all)
this is what was said (all-all-all-all-a-all a dream)


"had a dream," i said, "'bout who?" he said
"'bout b.i.g.," i said, "that's big," he said
"dig what he said", "proceed," he said
"indeed," i said, so, breathe i did
"don't repeat what i say," i said, he said nothing
he agreed with his head, he just nodded like this
what i believe to be a yes, i repeated what was said
"it came to me like a whisper last evening," i said
"what's the deal, playboy?" was the greeting he said
first thing i wanted to know was the reason he was dead
"mo' money mo' problems,'" better believe it," he said
"careful what you wish for, you might receive it," he said
"i see," i said, "jealousy" i said
"got the whole industry mad at me," i said
then b.i. said, "hov, remind yourself:
nobody built like you, you designed yourself!"
"i agree," i said, "my one of a kind self"
getting stoned every day like jesus did
"what he said," i said, "has been said before"
"just keep doin your thing," he said; "say no more"


"i see," i said, "jealousy" i said
"got the whole industry mad at me," i said
then b.i. said, "hov, remind yourself:
nobody built like you, you designed yourself!"
"i agree," i said, "my one of a kind self"
getting stoned every day like jesus did
"what he said," i said, "has been said before"
"just keep doin your thing," he said; "say no more"

let's get to the proceedings preceding this evening
let's do this thing (let's do it right this time)
come on


h-o-v-a
i got my mojo back, baby, "oh, behave"
nah, nah, don't be afraid
y'all and your articles hock spit at jay
y'all, from afar, threw darts my way
what you thought, i would not have nothin' to say? nope
y'all fell into the booby trap
i set the trap just to see dude react, and now
and now, you's can't leave
you opened the door, god, i'm at you annually
and i'm sorry, ms. rosie perez
i call a spade a spade, it just is what it is
but you can't give cred to anything dude says
same dude to give you ice and you owe him some head
shorty, it's time to wake up the dead
you sound a little naïve in them articles that i read


h-o-v-a
the blueprint 2, baby, on the way
h-o-v-a
i got my mojo back, baby, "oh, behave"
h-o-v-a
the blueprint 2, baby, on the way
h-o-v-a
i got my mojo back, baby, "oh, behave"


can't y'all see that he's fake, the rap version of t.d. jakes
prophesizin' on your cd's and tapes
won't break you a crumb of the little bit that he makes
and this is with whom you want to place your faith?
i put dollars on mine, ask columbine
when the twin towers dropped, i was the first in line (it's real)
donatin' proceeds off every ticket sold
when i was out on the road, that's how you judge hov, no?
ain't i supposed to be absorbed in myself?
every time there's a tragedy, i'm the first one to help
they call me this misogynist
but they don't call me the dude to take his dollars to give gifts at the projects
these dudes is all politics, depositin' checks
they put in they pocket, all you get in return is a lot of lip (yap, yap, yap)
and y'all buy the shit, caught up in the hype
'cause the nigga wear a kufi, it don't mean that he bright
'cause you don't understand him, it don't mean that he nice
it just means you don't understand all the bullshit that he write (the fuck is you sayin'?)
is it oochie wally wally or is it one mic?
is it black girl lost or shorty owe you for ice?
i've been real all my life, they confuse it with conceit
since i will not lose, they try to help him cheat
but i will not lose, for even in defeat
there's a valuable lesson learned, so it evens up for me
when the grass is cut, the snakes will show
i gotta thank the little homie nas for that, though (haha)
savin' me the hassle of speakin' to half of these assholes
and i'ma let karma catch up to jaz-o, whoa
i'm back before you had a chance to miss me
my mama can't save you this time, niggas is history
who you know flow vicious as me?
yet so religiously, that's why they call me hov'
i get the spoils 'cause the victor is me (me, nigga)
you're an actor, you're not who you're depicted to be
you street dreamin', all y'all niggas livin' through me
i gave you life when niggas was forgettin' you emcee
i'm a legend, you should take a picture with me
you should be happy to be in my presence, i should charge you a fee
i'm big dog, glenn rob, listen, god, you a flea
and the little homie jungle is a garden to me
what's the problem, b? you not as hard as me
nigga, hard as we, nigga, r-o-c, nigga
that's why they follow me
they feel my pain and my agony, nigga
i won't rest 'til you on one knee
you want war, then it's war it's gon' be, nigga
until you on one knee
you want war, then it's war it's gon' be, nigga


h-o-v-a
the blueprint 2, baby, on the way
h-o-v-a
i got my mojo back, baby, "oh, behave"
h-o-v-a
the blueprint 2, baby, on the way
h-o-v-a
i got my mojo back, baby, "oh, behave"

but keep somethin' up my sleeve that'll help me through
but can you believe, everywhere i'm at, models come through
cat-fightin', cat-walkin', it happens often
it's true how society don't want me to move
into the penthouse building with spectacular views
they're like uhh, "he's a menace he could never be a tenant"
i'm like ooh, what's a young nigga to do?
i bring the brothers to the building give a feeling that i don't
give a fuck we just chillin' watchin' chandelier ceilings high as fuck
old lady, don't blow my high
'specially if you don't know my life, don't make me bring

victim of a single parent household, born in a mouse hole
mousetrap, niggas wanna know

it's clearly hard for ya, what god has bestowed on me
you're not as raw as me nigga, nigga, i'm poetry
in four-part harmony, it's like jodeci
check out my melody, my flow is a felony
oh, i'm so seventies, i'm in tune with the heavenly
governing body, check, check, check out my destiny
i walk leaving four footprints, my hood sense
my book smarts, my faith of the unknown and a good heart
what's seldom shown is the good part
like i said, you try to bring 'em life, but they want dead
you won't listen, hov is a nice guy, but don't diss him
that'll piss him off quick, you won't listen


don't you know when you're defeated, young punk?
won't you throw, won't you throw in the towel, stop running your mouth?
don't you know that we know you're just running your mouth?
'cause when this shit pops off you gon' run in your house
don't you know when you're defeated, young punk?
won't you throw, won't you throw in the towel? i'm better with vowels
my vocabulary murders the dictionary
flow switches every sixteen, the shit mean, man


c'mon, man, c'mon, man
c'mon, man
woo, c'mon, man
c'mon, man
fat shout the whole roc

let's try this, guru
(every time i think about you) yeah yeah
(i feel so alive)
(i wish i could hold onto you forever)
this is how i start my day anew
uhh, uh huh, uh huh, yeah, uhh


(i woke up early this morning with a new sight over life)
good morning america, ghetto usa
(never read the qur'an or islamic scriptures
only psalms i read was on the arms of my niggas)
uhh, come on, good morning
it was the best of times, it was the worst of times
(the sunshine was shining, you were on my mind)


yeah, i wake up, hit my shoebox, i snatch out a few rocks
put the rest inside, now i'm ready to ride
put the bomb in my socks so cops can't locate the vials
i ain't freshly dressed but got a colgate smile
that's right, hah
(i woke up early this morning)
throw on the same clothes i had on last night
i got loads of capers to come up with this paper
i got money schemes that come to me in my dreams
hit the block like a veteran
fiends need they medicine, i'm the relief pitcher
their clean up hitters, it works
i hit the ave., stash the bag in the dirt
put the rest in my small pocket, i start clockin'
(i woke up early this morning)
same routine: i'm runnin' game to fiends
exchangin' cash for crack rocks, back and forth to my stash box
hundred dollars a week
shorties got the ave. watched, fiends swarm
i'm gettin' rid of this bomb, as i


(i woke up early this morning with a new sight over life)
good morning
(never read the qur'an or islamic scriptures
only psalms i read was on the arms of my niggas)
(i woke up early this morning with a new sight over life)
(the sun was shinin', you were on my mind)
(i woke up early this morning...)

yes, a lime to a lemon, my va women

she wanna wrinkle my linens
so i sprinkle her with gin and then we begin sinnin', uhh
blasphemy, oh my god, every sentence
she keeps scratchin' me like she have tiger in her
this is exact-a-ly, why i had to pin her
to the bed like a wrestler, had to pretzel her, uhh
her man kept pagin', stressin' her
so i told her what to say just in case he question her
situations will arise, but you gotta be smart about it
no matter what you do (don't talk about us)
don't give up no info (he'll be lost without it)
just keep your mouth shut, we could do this again, bring a friend!


guess who's back in my motherfuckin' house
half black, half white chick; i call her minnie mouse (woo!)
we always hook up when we out
we do what we like to do and then we out
but lately i've been havin' the strangest feelings
your boy young hov' catchin' feelings
and it's messin' up my dealings 'cause mami's not willin'
to leave her boyfriend, she call me her toy-friend
said, we was just 'sposed to hook up and have a blast
she called me her emergency dick-in-a-glass, haha (hehehe)
i had to laugh for a second
had to check myself, get my mackin' back in perspective
i slack for a second but i'm back, no question
like i walk with a cane, ain't no half steppin'
geah, and on that note
iceberg slim is back to rock a boat, c'mon

uh
this beat is like you just walking in place like this
let me try to get through this here...


y'all wanna take my life, then come and get it
i'm so committed to street life, sometimes i don't sleep nights
if y'all ain't ready to die, my advice would be to
back up and live, 'cause the fact of this is
i keep .44s in the sky, mind on my money
nigga, i'm so for real, i hope you're not finding this funny, nah
live everyday like my last, fast money
fast cars, fast temper, draw down faster than y'all
i got to get my shit off, i came from nothin'
but pop's dick, mom's egg, hungry like a hostage
with every step that i take, i use my hood sense
study my footprints, learn from my mistakes
i'm much braver than most, got the heart of a ghost
i was born dead, baby, my life is all gravy
reporting live from the roc, i rep for my set
till the date of my death, i will die for my block


i gotta get my shit off (get off, get off)
get off my ass and get about that cash
i gotta get my shit off (get off, get off)
live everyday like my last, like death's approaching fast
gotta get my shit off (shit off! get off, get off)
get off my ass and get about my cash
gotta get my shit off (shit off! shit off! shit off!)
live everyday like my last...


if there was heaven above us, i was living in hell
my neighborhood was the roughest, i never complained
i just adjusted my game, pushed 20s of 'caine
bush and reagan couldn't stop me from makin'
i wish i could dream about being a lawyer
but i had dealers in my hallway, death around the corner
couldn't tell right from wrong, pimps will spoil you
give you dollars for errands when nobody was carin'
i got to get my shit off, it rang true every time
i heard it or every time somebody got murdered
we pour liquor on the curb until the cement stain
i cried enough tears from my eyes to equal 3-inch rain
motherfuckers, i deserve it when i be in the range
i copped them uncut stones that be freezing the chain
i done been through enough shit to make you pee in your pants
man, i'm sorry if we ain't seeing the same, i seen it rain


i gotta get my shit off (get off, get off)
get off my ass and get about that cash
i gotta get my shit off (get off, get off)
live everyday like my last, like death's approaching fast
gotta get my shit off (shit off! get off, get off)
get off my ass and get about my cash
gotta get my shit off (shit off! shit off! shit off!)
live everyday like my last...


that's why i give you my up and downs, my pain, my passion, my pleasure
my good and bad times, niggas, my whatever
my hopes and dreams, blood, tears and sweat
my version of r. kelly, this is a nigga's threat
my life is an open book, nigga, i hope you took from it
whatever works for you, i was put on this earth to move
mountains, i think, i'm almost sure
but i've been smoking a lot lately, not counting my drinks
i got to get my shit off, for that i'm certain
that's why it's less than 8 months, i am back to work
nigga, i'm clear, i done seen my cupboards bare
heard money mentioned in my mother's prayer
had nights my stomach filled up with nothing but air
got 10 dollars to eat for 4 of us to share
that's why hov' act like that, quick to snap
mac-11 ready, i ain't going back


i gotta get my shit off (get off, get off)
get off my ass and get about that cash
i gotta get my shit off (get off, get off)
live everyday like my last, like death's approaching fast
gotta get my shit off (shit off! get off, get off)
get off my ass and get about my cash
gotta get my shit off (shit off! shit off! shit off!)
live everyday like my last...

yeah, it's magic
huh? jay-z and lenny kravitz
and it's a heavy d production, you bastards
come on
hah, hey yo, stop playing man
this is real serious, huh? (it's the roc)
yeah (yo) yo, let's go


post positano, hov' hanging with bono
u2 can live like salvatore ferragamo
and you too can cool out poolside at the delano
if you too flow like you was out of your mind yo
'cause who knew dude that loved apple pies from mcdonald's
would soon be the boss of the big apple? ya know
and who knew dude that played ball for the nba
would make a mistake on the who knew estates? throw it away
who knew that would be his last shot, who drew up that play?
they giveth and they taketh, life is cruel that way
but even a broken clock is right at least two times a day
you could have turned guns into roses like two times today
now here's something you gotta say two times to jay
i got my shades on, waiting for the sun to shine my way
got my boom box, suntan lotion, waiting for action
they say when you play with skills, good luck could happen
let's go


c'mon (it's the roc)
c'mon (it's the roc)
c'mon (it's the roc)
c'mon (let's rock)
c'mon!


things got too hot so i jumped off in this rap shit
you got it criss-crossed, ain't no turning me backwards
too many district attorneys concerned with the actions
of one individual, he's criminally attached
i turned in all my rap chips, i'm earning my bachelors
by dating all the models and actresses
i'm learning all the potholes in every single barrio
trying not to mess up my axis kid
on the road to the riches through trafficking
through rapping and whatever's happening
rocawear, i'm the young black ralph lauren
every time i get out, they pull me right back in
the michael corleone of the microphone
the michelangelo of flow, i paint pictures with poems
i gather no moss like a rolling stone
case the grim reaper visits my home, nigga i'm gone, c'mon


c'mon (it's the roc)
c'mon (it's the roc)
c'mon (it's the roc)
c'mon (let's rock)
c'mon!


tote more guns than roses, foes is
visibly shook of the invisible bully (let's go)
flowers need water to grow, it gotta rain
in order to experience joy, you need pain
every time a baby is born, somebody's slain
you know the saying, somebody's loss is another's gain
the sun comes out when the water goes down the drain
a rainbow then the clouds come out, we do it again
everything evens up, you just wait
even a garbage can gets a steak
you ain't even a garbage can, you have faith
but when it turns your way, before it turns away
gotta turn that into something, you gotta learn from jay
you'll get return on your investment if attention you pay
let's go


c'mon (it's the roc)
c'mon (it's the roc)
c'mon (it's the roc)
c'mon (let's rock)
c'mon!



yes, yes yep!
welcome to the.. jay-z extravaganza
i'd like to introduce my band right now
just blaze and the blazettes, hehe
right now i want you to give the drummer some
no ma really, give the drummer some
uhh


touch the untouchable, break the unbreakable
shake the unshakeable (it's hovi baby)
yeah, ch-chi-uh, uh-ch-ch-uh, un-breakable
rock the unrockable (it's hovi baby)


follow the flow, look
they say a midget standin' on the giant's shoulder can see much
further than the giant.. (the giant..)
so i got the whole rap world on my shoulder they tryin' to see
further than i am... (than i am..)
and i have been tryin' to be patient with they preoccupation
with david and goliath.. (goliath..)
but sooner or later, that patience gonna run it's course
and i'm forced to be a tyrant.. (be a tyrant..)
but me and tyran, comin' through your environment
iron mask, nigga, iron gats, nigga i am back
with "the team," no i in that
r.o.c., y'all not eyein' that
y'all don't see, clearly 'cause the rain ain't gone
"the dynasty," no not ming but shawn's
dame, kareem, nigga it's the gangsta team
stop your run, one of the reasons that they call us gangrene
the other reason, we got a gang of green
if there's better at gettin' cheddar that remains to be seen, nigga
(woooooooooooooooooooooooo!!!!!) jeah, jeah


can't touch the untouchable, break the unbreakable
shake the unshakeable (it's hovi baby)
can't see the unseeable, reach the unreachable
do the impossible (it's hovi baby)
can't move the unmoveable, stop the unstoppable

jeah, look
i'm so far ahead of my time, i'm 'bout to start another life
look behind you, i'm 'bout to pass you twice
back to the future, gotta slow up for the present
i'm fast, niggas can't get pass my past
how they propose to deal with my perfect present?
when i unwrap the gift & the curse in one session
ain't no livin' person can test him
only two restin' in heaven can be mentioned in the same breath as him
seven straight summers, critics might not admit it
but nobody in rap did it, quite like i did it
if you did it i done it before, you get it i had it
got mad at it and don't want it no more
and that goes for everything from flippin' that raw
flippin' whores, flippin' vocal chords, don't get it twisted
get it right, did different, did it better, did it nice
did the impossible then did it twice (get it right)


can't touch the untouchable, break the unbreakable
shake the unshakeable (it's hovi baby)
can't see the unseeable, reach the unreachable
do the impossible (it's hovi baby)


yup! hovi's home, the global phone
the world is back in order, the number one rap recorder is back
you cats over-felt yourself
you couldn't help yourself, now witness the real for real
in my absence cats get, absent-minded
now it's time to rewind and remind 'em
why i'm in the position that i am
changin' the game, my game could nail madonna
well after i'm gone, they'll honor
history in the makin', pistol pete
leave competition shakin' without missin' the beat (woo!)
chasin' the hi-hat all over the track
the snare is scared of the air in here, boom!
and plus i get paper dog, don't let me forget
the watch face so blue like it's holdin' it's breath
can't see me skill for skill or check for check
it's the bow-tie flow dog, i bring it to your neck
live and direct, i will bring it to your set
i got now, i don't care who got next
rapper slash exec., kordell stewart
your flow all y'all using is mine, you're all useless
you ain't a factor, who are you foolin'?
you all are faggots, you takin' us backwards (takin' it backwards)
i'm tryin' to progress with this rap shit
nigga, nigga your whole career's a accident
who was gassin' 'em? (fuck outta here!)


can't touch the untouchable, break the unbreakable
shake the unshakeable (it's hovi baby)
can't see the unseeable, reach the unreachable
do the impossible (it's hovi baby)

now, the end is near (can you believe this shit guru?)
so i face (i'm from the hood man) the final curtain
(no the real hood the hood, not the rap hood)
(the real hood, like three pair of pants)
my friends, i'll say it clear (pair of sneakers)
(my moms is bustin' her ass) state my case
(nigga i'm goin' to japan tomorrow!) which i'm certain
(you understand what i'm sayin'? can you believe that?)
i lived a life that's full (they have people, waitin'
at the airport like five days like i'm a beatle or somethin')
(that's really somethin'!) and i traveled each, and every highway
(seen the best of the best, the worst of the worst) and more
much more than this (still here) i did it myyyyyy wayyyyyyy
(let's try this one, uhh, yeah!)


momma's youngest and strongest, survived summers like saunas
mastered a corner like deion in his uniform
pop hurtin' assertive, flirted with death
damn near murdered before my first album hit the shelf
grandma's favorite, she could not understand
how there's people in the world who wouldn't want me as a neighbor
had to explain to her, you think these folks want me in the penthouse
as a reminder that i make top paper?
black entrepreneur, nobody did us no favors
nobody gave us shit, we made us
the rap pack, i'm sinatra, dame's sam davis
biggs the smart one on the low like dean martin
we came in this game, not beggin' niggas pardon
demandin' y'all respect, hand over a check
and while y'all at it, hand over the jet
we the reason they ain't hand over def jam so quick
they knew every year i was droppin' new product
i was raisin' the stock up, while buildin' the roc up
but that's alright, 'cause they knew they had to see us
when it was time for us to re-up, make us multi-million-aires
je-je-jeah!


jeah! in my lifetime
i caught smaller cases, but i had capital
hypocritical system let me right back at you
you better hope a rich rapper never attacks you
not even that scratches you, 'specially if you black dude
they don't give a shit unless the accused just happen to rap
and they can look good by paintin' him as bad news
'cause in my past, i seen dudes get half of they views
exposed to the curb and nobody said a word
so imagine how disturbed i was
when i seen how big they made my fight scene at the club
let me explain exactly how this shit was
this nigga un, yo, i scratched him, he went home without an aspirin but it’s cool 'cause we back friends, it happened and it's over
it's in the past and i'm glad, now i'm back to bein' hova
maybach with the chauffeur, laid back
helicopter seat, feet inclined, shit feelin' like a sofa
helicopter meet me, teterboro take me over
somewhere peaceful for the weekend now it's back to speakin' to vultures
so the next time that page six approaches us
here's a quote from jay, nigga i did it my - way



みなさんjay-zのようになりたいよ

she never seen a hundred on the wrist before
never seen twenty-twos on the six before
i am killin' 'em out there, they needin' first aid

the crib got killer views and square feet

so sleep if you need to, mami, i will leave you

uhh, uhh, yeah
first they love me then they hate me then they love me again
they love me again (uhh)
let's take a trip down
i gotcha


let's take a trip down memory lane at the cemetery
rain, grey skies, seems at the end of every
young black life is this line, "damn, him already?
such a good kid," got us pourin' henn' already
liquor to the curb for my niggas up above
when it cracks through the pavement, that's my way of sendin' love
so give big a hug, tell aaliyah i said, "hi"
'til the next time i see her, on the other side
he was just some thug that caught some slugs
and we loved him 'cause, in him, we saw some of us
he walked like us, talked like us
his back against the wall, nigga fought like us, damn
poor isis, that's his mama name
mama ain't strong enough to raise no boy, what's his father name?
shorty never knew him, though he had his blood in him
hot temper, mama said he act just like her husband
daddy never fucked with him, so the streets raised him
isis blamin' herself, she wish she could've saved him
damn near impossible, only men can raise men
he was his own man, not even him can save him
he put his faith in a .38 in his waist
but when you live by the gun, you die by the same fate
end up dead before 38 and umm
that's the life of us raised by winter, it's a cold world
ol' girl turned to coke, tried to smoke her pain away
isis' life just ended on that rainy day
when she got the news her boy body could be viewed
down at the city morgue, opened the drawer, saw him nude
her addiction grew, prescription drugs, sippin' brew
angel dust dipped in woo!
she slipped into her own fantasy world
had herself pregnant by a different dude
but reality bites and this is her life
he wasn't really her husband, though he called her wife
it was just this night when moon was full
and the stars were just right, and the dress was real tight
had her soundin' like lisa lisa
i wonder if i take you home, will you still love me after this night?
mike was the hard head from around the way
that she wanted all her life, shit, she wanted all the hype
used to hold on tight when he wheelied on the bike
he was a willie all her life, he wasn't really the one to like
it was a dude named sha who would really treat her right
he wanted to run to the country to escape the city life
but isis liked this broadway life
she loved the gucci sneakers, the red, green and whites
hangin' out the window when she first seen him fight
she was so turned on that she had to shower twice
how ironic it would be some fight that
turned into a homicide that'll alter their life
see mike at 32 was still on the scene
had a son, 15, that he never saw twice
sure he saw him as an infant, but he disowned him like
"if that was my son, he would look much different
see i'm light-skinned and that baby there's dark"
so it's mama's baby, papa's maybe
mike was still crazy out there runnin' the streets (fuck niggas want?)
had his old reliable .38 gun in his reach
it's been fourteen years, him and isis ain't speak
he runnin' around like life's a peach
'til one day, he approached this thug that had a mean mug
and it looked so familiar that he called him "young cuz"
told him get off the strip but the boy ain't budge (fuck you)
instead he pulled out a newer .38 snub
he clearly had the drop but the boy just paused (hold up)
there was somethin' in this man's face he knew he seen before
it's like lookin' in the mirror, seein' his self more mature
and he took it as a sign from the almighty lord
you know what they say about he who hesitates in war
(what's that?) he who hesitates is lost
he can't explain what he saw before his picture went blank
the old man didn't think, he just followed his instinct
six shots into his kin out of the gun
niggas be a father, you're killin' your son
six shots into his kin out of the gun
niggas, be a father, you killin' your sons


meet the parents (the parents, the parents, the parents)
(the parents, the parents, the parents, the parents)
(the parents, the parents, the parents, the parents)
(the parents, the parents, the parents, the parents, the parents)

my nigga, please - you ain't signin' no checks like these
my nigga, please - you pushin' no wheels like these
my nigga, please - you ain't holdin' no tecs like these
my nigga, please - you don't pop open vests like these
(my nigga please, uh-huh, uh)
(this my world, pimp stroll, let's do this)


nigga please, you ain't start out from your trunk
then reach the roof, just to put your roof in your trunk
nigga please, chumps don't tour like us
you on the road a million hours, i fly over your bus
nigga please, you ain't got your neck all froze
with the same logo that you got sketched on your clothes
nigga please, you don't be getting no hoes
with la perla on they cheeks, can't be messin with cheap chicks
nigga please, you seldom seen with chicks in 7 jeans
manolo blahnik, i'm goin through they body like an ultrasonic
you ain't got 'em blowin no chronic
divine intervention, y'all can't prevent me from shinin
nigga please, i been around the world
i damn near beat jordan in around-the-world

some how, some way
we gotta make it up out this life, c'mon
some how, some way
we gotta make it up out the hood some day
some way
we gotta make it up out this life


whether we dribble out this motherfucker
rap metaphors and riddle out this motherfucker
work second floors, hospital out this motherfucker
some how we gotta get up out this motherfucker
some day the cops'll kill a muh'fucker
i don't always wanna be this drug dealing muh'fucker, damn
wish i could take us all
on this magic carpet ride through the sky
i, used to play the hall and fifth floor
me and my boys, we all poor, getting high
i, seen the worst of the worst
i deserve every blessing i received, i'm from the dirt
i, planted my seed on unfertile land
myrtle park, marcy, flushing and nostrand
and, still i grew
some how i knew that the sun'll shine through and
touch my soul, take hold of my hand
look man, a tree grows in brooklyn


some how, some way
i gotta make it up out the hood someday
some how, some way
i gotta make it up out this life, c'mon
some way
i gotta make it up out this hood some day


some how, some way
we gotta make it up out the hood some day
some how, some way
we gotta make it up out this life, c'mon
some how, some way
we gotta make it up out the hood some day
some way

oh, this must be the way the nigga pac felt when he made
me against the world, all eyez on me
y'all niggas got me feelin' like all eyes on me, me against the world
mmm, y'all got me on my shit
thought niggas would appreciate what i did to this game
being that i'm flesh of your flesh, blood of your blood
come from the same hood you come from
we share basically the same stories
thought niggas would appreciate what i came and did
since ninety-six, every year
something must be seriously wrong with the world
i know y'all ain't hating


(some people hate) don't tell me niggas is hating
(some people hate) uhh, nah, you know what i think?
(some people hate) i think...
(i think they've lost their minds) think y'all lost your mind
y'all got me on my shit


raw, rough and rugged, when addressing the mass public
my attitude is fuck it 'cause motherfuckers love it
got a chip on my shoulder the size of the golden nugget in vegas
and fuck being famous, i came to get the butters
i came from the gutter, my success in this game
is sort of like pro-jectic justice
a payment for brushes with police officers
a peace offering from the gods for the streets i was tossed in
til i'm deceased in a coffin
i'ma be a beast on these beats releasing early and often
please, your disdain for the brothers ain't gon change the numbers
it's the strengthening of chain among us
please we ain't afraid of none of ya's; who want it with us?
ain't nuttin changed since the ninety-six summer, c'mon


(some people hate) yeah
(some people hate) uh, uh, uh
(some people hate) yeah! you know what i think?
(i think they've lost their minds) they say success breeds envy


i guess it's just the penalty of leadership
i guess i'm what niggas wanna be and shit
or niggas just bored wanna be in shit
'fore they get to rappin', start believing it, think they ali and shit
i roll with the punches so i survive
i bob and weave, move my feet from side to side
i'm back, stronger than ever, surprise, surprise
they try to take me out the game but i's alive
it's like a old negro spiritual, but i mastered tobey
with a splash of monster kody, shoot faster than kobe, nigga
you bastards know me, the one and only
big homie from the roc, i think you pastors lonely
you need jesus in your life
it's either that or y'all gon' make me
put the double desert eagles in your life, nigga


(some people hate)
(i know nigga's ain't hating man, let me find out)
(some people hate) jealousy is a weak emotion, man
(some people kill their brothers)
c'mon man, be stronger than that.. you know what i think?
(i think they've lost their minds) you'll be alright though


au contraire, nigga, i am here 'cause i earned this shit
by riding out when niggas had learners' permit
we bring then knives out or we let them burners spit
i bring them pies out if niggas wanna burn the strip
bring your rides out, bring your buggy eyes out
turn your six, i laid back in the maybach
nigga this the payback, i know you bitch niggas from way back
niggas wanna clown, but the pound, it don't play that
get yourself found drowned where the lake at
run up on 'em notoriously, take that, take that
and then we coming where your wake at
eight maniac cats strapped with gats, you can hate that
face facts, fake rap cats
can't take back what i took back to the brook, look



picture all the possibilities
picture all the possibilities
sounds like a love song
sounds like a love song
the most incredible, baby
uh
mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm
yeah, yeah
uh
i can't see 'em comin' down my eyes
so i gotta make the song cry
i can't see 'em comin' down my eyes
so i gotta make the song cry


good dude, i know you love me like cooked food
even though a nigga gotta move like a crook move
we was together on the block since free lunch
we shoulda been together havin' four seasons brunch
we used to use umbrellas to face the bad weather
so now we travel first-class to change the forecast
never in bunches, just me and you
i loved your point of view 'cause you held no punches
still i left you for months on end
it's been months since i checked back in
we're somewhere in a small town
somewhere lockin' a mall down
woodgrain, four and change, armor all'd down
i can understand why you want a divorce now
though i can't let you know it, pride won't let me show it
pretend to be heroic, that's just one to grow with
but deep inside, a nigga so sick


i can't see 'em comin' down my eyes
so i gotta make the song cry
i can't see 'em comin' down my eyes
so i gotta let the song cry, uh
can't see it comin' down my eyes
so i gotta make the song cry
i can't see it comin' down my eyes
so i got to make the song cry


on repeat, the cd of big's "me & my bitch"
watchin' bonnie and clyde, pretendin' to be that shit
empty gun in your hand, sayin', "let me see that clip"
shopping sprees, pull out your visa quick
a nigga had very bad credit, you helped me lease that whip
you helped me get the keys to that v dot 6
we was so happy poor, but when we got rich
that's when our signals got crossed and we got flipped
rather mine, i don't know what made me leave that shit
made me speed that quick, let me see, that's it
it was the cheese, helped them bitches get amnesia quick
i used to cut up they buddies, now they sayin' they love me
used to tell they friends i was ugly and wouldn't touch me
then i showed up in that dubbed-out buggy
and then they got fuzzy, and they don't remember that
and i don't remember you


i can't see it comin' down my eyes
so i gotta make the song cry
i can't see it comin' down my eyes
so i gotta make the song cry
yeah, i seen 'em comin' down your eyes
but i gotta make the song cry
i can't see it comin' down my eyes
so i gotta make the song cry


a face of stone, was shocked on the other end of the phone
word back home is that you had a special friend
so what was oh so special then?
you have given away without gettin' at me
that's your fault, how many times you forgiven me?
how was i to know that you was plain sick of me?
i know the way a nigga livin' was wack
but you don't get a nigga back like that
shit, i'm a man with pride, you don't do shit like that
you don't just pick up and leave and leave me sick like that
you don't throw away what we had just like that
i was just fuckin' them girls, i was gon' get right back
they say you can't turn a bad girl good
but once a good girl's gone bad, she's gone forever
i'll mourn forever
shit, i've got to live with the fact i did you wrong forever


i can't see 'em comin' down my eyes
so i gotta make the song cry
i can't see 'em comin' down my eyes
so i gotta let the song cry
i know, i seen 'em comin' down your eyes
but i gotta make the song cry
i can't see 'em comin' down my eyes
so i gotta make the song cry

all of these rap singers claiming they bangers
doing all sorts of twisted shit with they fingers
disrespectin' the game, no home training or manners
i was doing this shit when you was shitting in pampers
i was moving them grams 'fore you knew what a hand-to-hand was
ducking the vans, radars and scanners
before you knew what hard white or tan was
i was hitting the turnpike, aight with the bammers
i was nice with my hands cause i'm hype with them hammers
i was pricking my finger 'fore you knew what a fam' was
i had it laid out 'fore you knew what a plan was
three hundred mil' later—now you understand us
y'all ain't see us coming through vegas

word to the hyphen in my name!
