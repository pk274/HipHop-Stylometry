roc-a-fella forever, hov' for life
debut's a classic, first album, four mics
should've got a five, but niggas lack foresight
but i don't give a fuck, i ain't do it for the hype
i do it for the hustlers for the ghetto for the plight
for the struggle for those who bubble white
for fly 4x4s, roofless cars, flawless ice
for the pain for y'all to know what it's like
for every time it rains 40 days and 40 nights
for every promise made that never saw the light
i'll get my own forty acres, give me four nights
four o's, a glock 40 for the jackers and i'm spike
or the four-four will suffice
a fourteen-year-old to look out for the vice
you can sit back and just wait for the flight
your boy'll take off like i've been strippin' all my life
that's the type of metaphors i write
to let niggas know i was real before the mic
four front rows, had the fur at the fight
no peta on my peter, left some room for the divas
in the suite, we'll meet up if ya wild for the night
on a rampage, champagne pours, on the floor
for all those who ain't make it here and lost they life
wouldn't forget y'all for any price
not for no hoes, not for no ice
not for no fame nor for bright lights
so i'ma end this here, a fly ass kite
44 four's, muh'fucka, i'm nice

ooh you so nasty, amateur pole dancing
come and get this cash from me, they call me rain man
she tried to rain dance, money so long it'll drown you girl
buried under so much stacks
they had to pull back about 50 thou before they found ya girl
i brought book bags of that bankroll, i'm a d-boy, baby they know
i'm an original d-boy, they go bankrupt if they try to keep up
no roof in my car but i got mirrors on the ceiling
i'll spread bread on the bed, ever had sex on a million?
tell me


red light, tlc
through the left eye, my pov
on the ichat
how's that for computer love? she rolled her eyes back
i'm like, "ooh you're so nasty"
you turned my maybach back seat into the hotel de'paris
i ain't gotta go down to the go-go
you got a private show that's like magic city
i got stacks of fifties, i got piles of hundreds
let's role play, act like you want it
you know, you know you hot like fire
you throw that body, i'll throw them dollars
but not them 1's and not no 5's
have you ever seen a grover cleveland?
that's a thousand dollar bill, baby


you know, you know, you hot like fire
as i blow, this dough, you might could retire
take it slow like neo, when shots was fired
in the matrix have patience, got lots of bottles
rock-a-bye baby jay-z got notes like mariah
got no 1's got no 5's, my d notes are higher
i'm a d boy, they decoys, they money is lighter
than nicole richie, roll with me, they on a diet baby


listen, uh! anything you want girl
i'll bet you never seen it like this
just stay up on that floor girl
and i'll grant all your wishes
you know, you know, you know (you hot)
you know, you know, you know (you hot)
you know, you know, you know (you hot)
you know, you know, you know
especially when you bounce, bounce
i really like it when you bounce, bounce
i see money when you bounce (this is sponsored by the goodfellas), bounce
girl i like it when you bounce, bounce, whoa


u-s-, h-e-r, r-a-, y-m-, o-n-d, skateboard p
and the j to the a to the y to the z, bitch!
hehe, woo!
magic city, club rolex, sue’s rondevu
and all the amateur strippers, who's in aerobics classes
try it out at home, it works baby, it work
i can make great, baby
just put it on the floor baby



geah, yeah
life is but a dream to me, i don't wanna wake up
thirty odd years without having my cake up
so i'm about my paper 24/7, 365, 366 in a leap year
i don't know why we here
since we gotta be here life is but a beach ch-ch-ch-chair
went from having shabby clothes, crossing over abbey road
hear my angels singing to me (are you happy, hov?)
i just hope i'm hearing right; karma's got me fearing like
colleek are you praying for me?
see i got demons in my past, so i got daughters on the way
if the prophecy's correct, then the child should have to pay
for the sins of a father, so i barter my tomorrows
against my yesterdays in hopes that she'll be okay
and when i'm no longer here to shade her face from the glare
i'll give her my share of carol's daughter and a new beach chair

life is but a dream to me
gun shots sing to these other guys
but lullabies don't mean a thing to me
i'm not afraid of dying, i'm afraid of not trying
every day, hit every wave like i'm hawaiian
i don't surf the net, no, i never been on myspace
too busy letting my voice vibrate
carving out my space in this world of fly girls
cut-throats and diamond-cut ropes i twirls
benzes 'round corners where the sun don't shine
i let the wheels give a glimpse of hope of one's grind
son said: "hov, how you get so fly?"
i said: "from not being afraid to fall out the sky"
my physical's a shell, so when i say farewell
my soul will find a even higher plane to dwell
so fly, you shall, so have no fear
just know that life is but a beach chair


i hear my angels sing...
life is just a dream and you really don't wanna wake up, wake up
(i hear my angels sing)
life is just a dream and you really don't wanna leave
life is but a dream
(i hear my angels sing)
life is just a dream and you really don't wanna wake up, wake up
(i hear my angels sing)
life is just a dream and you really don't wanna leave
life is but a dream


life is but a dream
can't mimic my life, i'm the thinnest cut slice
intercut, the winner's cup
with winters rough enough to interrupt life
that's why i'm both saint and sinner, nice
this is jay everyday, no compromise
no compass comes with this life, just eyes
so to map it out, you must look inside
sure, books could guide you, but your heart defines you, chica
your corazón is what brought us home
in great shape like heidi klum, maricón
i am on permanent vacay, life is but a beach chair
this song's like a hallmark card until you reach here
so 'til she's here, and she's declared
the heir, i will prepare
a blueprint for you to print, a map for you to get back
a guide for your eyes; and so you won't lose scent
i'll make a stink for you to think i ink these verses full of prose
so you won't get conned out of two cent
my last will and testament: i leave my heir
my share of roc-a-fella records and a shiny new beach chair


i hear my angels sing...
life is just a dream and you really don't wanna wake up, wake up
life is just a dream and you really don't wanna leave
life is but a dream
(i hear my angels sing)
life is just a dream and you really don't wanna wake up, wake up
life is just a dream and you really don't wanna leave
life is but a dream
life is just a dream and you really don't wanna wake up, wake up
life is just a dream and you really don't wanna leave
life is but a dream
life is just a dream and you really don't wanna wake up, wake up
life is just a dream and you really don't wanna leave
life is but a dream

shunning the one thing that they owe they life to
you let that man hype you to go against your idol
knowing good and god damn well this what i do
think i’m in the office, i’m off my grind?
that’s how kids become orphans
you lost ya mind?
i keep my enemies close
i give ‘em enough rope
they put themselves in the air
i just kick away the chair

niggas throwin' roc signs outside of your coupe
don’t look at hov like he done something wrong to ‘em
cause he’s on to 'em
he just took what belonged to him
niggas is playing checkers with chess-playing hov

emory jones
word to my momma, we livin'!

i been crushing the building since izod socks
so independent, sh..i might buy koch
i might not stop
places to cop, seventy-six floors, you can call me the doc
say when, say when
(when!)


inspired by basquiat, my chariot's on fire
everybody took shots, hit my body up, i'm tired
build me up, break me down to build me up again
they like: "hov, we need you back so we can kill your ass again"
"hov got flow though he's no big and pac, but he's close"
how i'm 'posed to win? they got me fightin' ghosts
same sword they knight you they gon' good night you with
sh.., thats' only half if they like you
that ain't even the half what they might do
don't believe me, ask michael
see martin, see malcolm
you see biggie, see pac, see success and its outcome
see jesus, see judas; see caesar, see brutus
see success is like suicide
suicide, it's a suicide
if you succeed, prepare to be crucified
media meddles, niggas sue you, you settle
every step you take, they remind you you ghetto
so it's tough bein' bobby brown
to be bobby then, you gotta be bobby now
now the question is, is to have had and lost
better than not having at 
everybody wanna be the king then shots ring
you layin' on your balcony with holes in your dream
or you malcolm x-d out, get distracted by screams
everybody get your hand off my jeans
everybody look at you strange, say you changed
uhh! like you work that hard to stay the same
uhh! game stays the same, the name changes
so its best for those to not overdose on being famous
most kings get driven so insane
that they try to hit the same vein that kurt cobain did
no dangers, so shameless
invited to the inner sanctum of your chambers
low chain 'em as the enemies approach
so raise your draw bridge and drown them in the moat
and the spirit i'm evoking
hold on


everybody screaming they want the old hov
but the new improved hov hit like albert pujols
everybody wanna hear me talk that money like phil rizzuto
but my mind is on pluto
bills that i do fold, i now invest on
trying to find some loopholes in the irs
as where i used to have a few hoes, i am just
concentrating on making a new hov through sex
i've awakened just in time to school those putos
trying to follow in my shoes with jewels froze
better adhere to this text 'fore you go
broke, spending more than you've accrued on silly baguettes
i know silly begets silly you'll learn on your own
at least my conscience is clear, i'm no longer steering you wrong
ain't nothing wrong with baguettes after you get a home
take care of your home, you can go back and—ugh!


i'm getting courted by the bosses
the edgars and doug morris-es-es
jimmy i's and lyors-es -- it's
gotta be more than the choruses
they respecting my mind now
just a matter of time now
operation: takeover corporate
makeover offices-es-es then takeover all of it
please may these words be recorded
to serve as testimony that i saw it all before it
came to fruition, sort of a premonition
uncontrollable hustler's ambition
alias superstition, like stevie
the writing's on the wall like my lady, right baby?
saw it all before, some of y'all thought i was crazy, maybe
like a fox, i'm cagey, ah-ah
the more successful, the more stressful
the more and more i transform to gordon gekko
in the race to a billion got my face to the ceiling
got my knees on the floor, please lord forgive him
has he lost his religion, is the greed gon' get him?
he's having heaven on earth, will his wings still fit him?
i got the forbes on my living room floor
and i'm still talking to the poor, nigga i want more
time's most influential, was impressive
'specially since i wasn't in the artist section
had me with the builders and the titans
had me right with rupert murdoch
billionaire boys and some dudes you never heard of
word up on madison ave is i'm a cash cow
word down on wall street, homie, you get the cash out
ipo hov, no need for reverse merger
the boy money talk no need to converse further
the baby blue maybach like i own gerber
boardroom i'm lifting ya skirt up

it ain't for everybody! (uhh)
welcome to hollywood, baby (take a picture)
uh-huh, you coming with? (let's not even talk about it)

ah, ah, ah, ah, come on
ooh it's the lights
you blinded by the (satisfaction!)
you need that (hollywood)
ah, ah, ah, ah, come on


paparazzi spots me in the lobby of my high-rise
i hide behind my shades cause the fame is blinding my eyes
my god, i know how ozzie oz
once had felt when he was as high as i have got
i have got to make this stop
people often warn me that the fame ain't for the faint of heart
it'll change those who said they had love for you into strangers
when your fame starts, it's a chain reaction
locomotion like when the train departs
stranger, things have happened
rapping, stacking, platinum plaquin'
born in brooklyn, got a place in manhattan
going back to brooklyn to escape the madness
when your friends is, chris and gwyneth
when your girl is more famous than you then it's
time to get all your windows tinted
keep your eyes squinted, it's gon' flash any minute
the music biz is like musical chairs
it's about where you standing when the music stop spinning


ooh it's the lights
you blinded by the (action!)
you need that (hollywood!)
ah, ah, ah, ah, come on
ooh it's the lights
you blinded by the (satisfaction!)
you need that (hollywood)

ghetto like the grease when you getting ya hair braided
sweeter than ya sister kool-aid is

can't believe i got away with
my earliest stages to being on stages
having my way with the world, congratulations!!

i'm talking when spaceships are around and ya great-great grands
reminiscing bout the foundation you gave em
for repairing my relationship with my pops before he passed
all i ask is you raise your glass in this celebration
toast to the most beautiful girl in the world
my inspiration thanks for the information


momma i made it... momma i made it


out in bk where
it ain't everyday that you make it out
be on top of yachts waving
i remember you saving for the light bill, paid the rent with the light bill
now our crib dark as a basement
had to lock up the phone when you wasn't home
we was communicating like the money you made wasn't basic
our cable was basic no hbo, wht, just ralph mcdaniels on the station
i aggravated you for atari and colecovision pinstripe lee's
when the first day of school came in
i was okay with not having everything
long as saturdays you had the commodores playing
the expression on your face was priceless
still with me till this day baby girl i won't erase it
i go to my grave with the memory of the sacrifice you made
you deserve a standing ovation


momma i made it... momma i made it


now your lil misfit make sure every day is christmas, write out your wish list
6's, wrist is glistening you don't even like jewels
but you could get missing anywhere you like to
where the waters light blue, anything you order
sign it to your nice room leave a extra tip, ma
be extra nice to 'em
ceo of carter foundation, wow!
i know pop looking down
i know colleek somewhere up in the clouds like
go get 'em grandma, make me proud
didn't have a man in the house so you made one
so i act like your husband and i'm only your son
i told you one day i'd get you a home
i didn't know it could possibly be in rome
told me don't wait on nobody, get your own
so with me myself and my microphone, i made it


momma i made it... momma i made it

i don't know what life will be in h.i.p. h.o.p
without the boy h.o.v
not only n.y.c. i'm hip hop's savior
so after this flow you might owe me a favor
when kingdom come, you ready?
when kingdom come, i'm ready
when kingdom come i'm ready


now everywhere i go they like hov come back
up out the corner office out the cul-de-sac
where's iceberg slim he was the coldest cat
get your swag back daddy where your focus at
got to admit a little bit i was sick of rap
but despite that the boy is back
and i'm so evolved i'm so involved
i'm showing growth, i'm so in charge
i'm ceo and yeah glory to god
i'm so indebted, i should have been deaded
selling blow in the park, this i know in my heart
now i'm so enlightened i might glow in the dark
i been up in the office you might know him as clark
but, just when you thought the whole world fell apart
i, take off the blazer, loosen up the tie
step inside the booth, superman is alive


the king of new york, new york
not only n.y.c., i'm hip hop's savior
so after this flow you might owe me a favor
when kingdom come, you ready?
when kingdom come, uh huh
not only n.y.c., i'm hip hop's savior
so after this flow you might owe me a favor


i hear "hurry up hov'" when i'm out in the public
'cause niggas like: "but you love it; you be it, you're of it
you breathe it, we need it; bring it back to the hustlas"
had to dust off the hammer dance, can't touch this
c'mon playboys, bring the cars back out
'cause ya boy hov is back, you know them broads coming out
got 'em dancing on the banquette, like they from bankhead
fuck cristal, so they ask me what we drinkin'
i thought dude's remark was rude okay
so i moved on to dom, krug rosé
and it's much bigger issues in the world, i know
but i first had to take care of the world i know
i'm from the bottom, so i still feel 'em from the bottom
underdog before my cape, still couldn't stop him
flash gordon when recording, spark the light in the dark
peter park', spider-man, all i do is climb the charts


the king of new york, new york
not only n.y.c., i'm hip hop's savior
so after this flow you might owe me a favor
when kingdom come, you ready?
when kingdom come, uh huh
not only n.y.c., i'm hip hop's savior
so after this flow you might owe me a favor


just when they thought it was all over
i put the whole world on my back and broad shoulders
the war-hova, but who you know took over tracks like that
guess what new york, new york - we back
and i ain't never been afraid of a drought
since i was six, seventeen been getting money down south
bout it, bout it, master p
ask the nigga pimp c, ask my homie bun b

y'all run, we chill still waters run deep
i repeat, sing along with me

uh, uh (it's not a diss song, it's just a real song)
uh, uh (you feel me?)

i heard motherfuckers sayin' they made hov
made hov say, "okay, so? make another hov!"
niggas wasn't playin' they day role
so we parted ways like ben and j-lo
i shoulda been did it but i been in a daze though
i put friends over business end of the day though
but when friends' business interests is day glow
ain't nothin' left to say though, i guess we forgot what we came fo'
shoulda stayed in food and beverage
too much flossin', too much sam rothstein
i ain't a bitch but i gotta divorce them
hov had to get the shallow shit up off him
and i ain't even want to be famous
niggas is brainless to unnecessarily go through these changes
and i ain't even know how it came to this
except that fame is the worst drug known to man
it's stronger than, heroin
when you could look in the mirror like, "there i am"
and still not see what you've become
i know i'm guilty of it too, but not like them; you lost one


lose one, let go to get one (one, one, one)
get one, lose some to win some (one, one, one, one, you lost one)
story of a champion (one, one, one)
sorry, i'm a champion, you lost one (one, one, one, one, uh)

i don't think it's meant to be, b
for she loves her work more than she does me
and honestly, at twenty-three
i would probably love my work more than i did she
so, we ain't we, it's me and her
'cause what she prefers over me is work
and that's where we differ
so i have to give her free time, even if it hurts
so, breathe, mami, it's deserved
you've been put on this earth to be all you can be like the reserves
and me? my time in the army, it's served
so i have to allow she her time to serve
the time's now for her, in time she'll mature
and maybe we can be we again like we were
finally, my time's too short to share
and to ask her now it ain't fair, so yeah, she lost one


lose, one, let go to get one (one, one, one)
get one, lose some to win some
one, one, one, oh yeah, she lost one
story of a champion (one, one, one)
sorry i'm a champion, you lost one (one, one, one)


my nephew died in the car i bought
so under the belief it's partly my fault
close my eyes and squeeze, try to block that thought
place any burden on me but please, not that, lord
but time don't go back, it goes forward
can't run from the pain, go towards it
some things can't be explained, what caused it?
such a beautiful soul, so pure, shit!
gonna see you again, i'm sure of it
'til that time, little man, i'm nauseous
your girlfriend's pregnant, the lord's gift
almost lost my faith, that restored it
it's like havin' your life restarted
can't wait for your child's life to be a part of it
so now i'm child-like, waitin' for a gift
to return, when i lost you, i lost it


lose, one, let go to get one (one, one, one)
get, one, lose some to win some
one, one, one, colleek, i lost one
story of a champion (one, one, one)
colleek, you're a champion, i lost one (one, one, one)

people was poor before the hurricane came
before the downpour poured, it was like when mary j. sang
everyday it rains, so everyday the pain
went ignored and i'm sure ignorance was to blame
but life is a chain, cause and effected
niggas off the chain, because they affected
it's a dirty game, it's whatever is effective
from weed to sellin' 'caine, gotta put that in effect, shit
wouldn't you loot? if you didn't have the loot
baby needed food and you was stuck on the roof
and helicopters swoop down just to get a scoop
through his telescopic lens, but he didn't scoop you
and the next five days, no help ensued
they called you a refugee because you seek refuge
and the commander-in-chief, just flew by
didn't stop, i know he had a couple seats
just rude jet blue, he's not, jet flew by the spot
what if he ran out of jet fuel and just dropped
huh, that woulda been somethin' to watch
helicopters doin' fly-bys to take a couple shots
couple portraits, then ignored 'em
he’d be just another bush surrounded by a couple orchids
poor kids, just 'cause they was poor kids
left them on they porches, same old story in new orleans
silly rappers, cause we got a couple porsches
mtv stopped by to film our fortresses
we forget the unfortunate
sure, i ponied up a mil' but i didn't give my time
so in reality i didn't give a dime
or a damn, i just put my monies in the hands
of the same people that left my people stranded
nothin' but a bandit, left them folks abandoned
damn, that money we gave was just a band-aid
can't say we better off than we was before
in synopsis, this is my minority report
can't say we better off than we was before
in synopsis, this is my minority report



bush: "buses are on the way to take those
people from new orleans, to houston"
(seems like we don't even care)
"they lie"

"people are dying, at the convention center" (ohh)

"their government has failed them" (ohh)
kanye west: "george bush doesn't care about black people"
(seems like we don't even care)
(seems like we don't even care)

you are tuned in
to the greatest
young h-o-v
let's go get 'em again, just
(oh my god, hov)


pops sped off, left mom with a bundle of
joy, ya boy smacked dab in the jungle
took tunnel vision, but he would soon become a mogul
but first he brought that crack back like a yo-yo
don't play with my yo-yo, loco niggas in the hood
first niggas hating on me, it's all good
i'm buying things like my shit don't stink, gucci links and gucci gooses
watching too many movies, bulletproof this
had some nerve, like pulling tooth'ses
when you're 16, coming through roofless
yea your boy "ruthless", like ice cube was
turn the whole city on, i'm the new plug
so if this is your first time hearing this
you're about to experience someone so cold
a journey seldom seen, the american dream
from the bottom to the top of the globe they call me hov


they gunning for me, wanna see me fall
you know my story, i've been through it all
night's i've felt like dying, but i ain't crying
what didn't kill me, made me strong as iron
iron, iron (oh my god, hov)


now i'm knee deep in the concrete
like a street's made a quicksand, it's beyond deep
i got a "chemical romance", two left feet
so now i dance with the devil, please g-o-d
save me from the "black parade", release me
my life like grand theft auto, psp
i'm in that volvo, puffing on that la-la
ducking from the po-po, every time i drive by
say hi to the bad guy, all my momma's friends was like
"mmm, mmm, mmm" would you just look at him
so sorry dear momma for your embarrassment
but give me a couple years and pray i'll never sin again
got all these rival dealers trying to do me in
and all these little rappers don't know how prepared for them i am (i am)
i'm feeling like the world's against me lord
call me crazy, but strangely i love the odds


they gunning for me, wanna see me fall
you know my story, i've been through it all
night's i've felt like dying, but i ain't crying
what didn't kill me, made me strong as iron
iron, iron (oh my god, hov)


now these baby ballers, toy rappers
callin out my name to bring the boy backwards
shooting air-balls at the basket
what you call money, i pay more in taxes
i got crowned king down in africa
out in nigeria, do you have any idea
sold out shows out in seoul, korea
jo'burg, dublin, tanzania
lunch with mandela, dinner with cavalli
still got time to give water out to everybody
everybody, fall back
y'all rapping, i'm reenacting
cnn, you see it's accurate
espn, see me in action
monday night's, when the half ends
when you 10 years in, holla back then


they gunning for me, wanna see me fall
you know my story, i've been through it all
night's i've felt like dying, but i ain't crying
what didn't kill me, made me strong as iron
iron, iron (oh my god, hov)


good lord, good lord, good lord
good lord, i said i feeeeeeeeeeeel like i'm dyiiiiiiiing

the game's fucked up
nigga's beats is bangin', nigga, your hooks did it
your lyrics didn't—your gangsta look did it
so i would write it if y'all could get it
bein' intricate'll get you wood, critic
on the internet, they like "you should spit it"
i'm like "you should buy it, nigga, that's good business" haha
forget this rap shit, i need a new hustle
a little bit of everything, the new, improved russell
i say that reluctantly, 'cause i do struggle
as you see, i can't leave, so i do love you
but i'm just a hustler disguised as a rapper
in fact, you can't fit this hustle inside of a wrapper
back when crack was what these pills are, i was a real star
complete with real cars, no video ones
you can come and set up a camera, let the video run
and my real life, complete with real ice
vvs boulders all invisibly set
head and shoulders, my invisible neck
you see, hova wasn't digital yet
before steve jobs made the ipod, was getting head jobs
we call that "interneck"
back when rappers wouldn't dare play lyrical roulette
with a automatic weapon i was rappin' with a tec
fresh like mannie be, chain like anti-freeze
shoebox full of cash, dealer-man hand me keys
pantries full of arm & hammer
don't take nancy drew to see what it do, i'm a damn g (ugh)
just sent a million dollars through a hands-free
that's big money talk—can you answer me?
before the answer was a three
i was down in georgetown with a hoya chick, lawyer chick
sure, he's rich now 'cause he saw the shit, all this shit
that's why they call him hov, 'cause he came before all this shit
bought a six, quarter seven, skipped on them quarter eights
bought a nine for nonstop glock work all the time (woo!)
guess who's back?
since this is a new era, got a fresh, new hat
ten-year veteran, i've been set
i've been through with this bullshit game, but i never can
i used to think rappin' at 38 was ill
but last year alone, i grossed 38 mil'
i know i ain't quite 38, but still
the flow so special, got a 38 feel
the real is back
hahahaha

(i done gotten in trouble again)
what the fuck
i tried, man
i'm back
peace talks this song (fuck, i tried!)
(i done gotten in trouble again)
hahahaha
yeah
(i done gotten in trouble again)


i try to pretend that i'm different, but in the end
we're all the same, all the same
i pray to god, father forgive a nigga
i'm never gonna change, gonna change
i try to pretend that i'm different, but in the end
we're all the same, all the same
i pray to god, father forgive a nigga
i'm never gonna change, gonna change


now the singer rob calls the police on me
y'all niggas ran out and copped the cd
see, what i discovered is y'all some snitch lovers
i might speak, but i don't fuck with nobody
see what doug, jimmy & l.a. don't know
these young'un's crossed the line with hov', i'm letting it blow
had the papers writing stories like, "didn't they know?
this what happen when they made that rapper ceo"
i know, it's just a matter of time before the steady hate
starts to overflow, then the levee breaks
and my conscience go, "you escaped the rico
why throw everything away over ego?
you paper-chasing, they paper-hating
billionaire hov', you on the pace to make it"
fuck that, exclamation, comma
quotation's "i love drama," period


i try to pretend that i'm different, but in the end
we're all the same, all the same
i pray to god, father forgive a nigga
i'm never gonna change, gonna change
i try to pretend that i'm different, but in the end
we're all the same, all the same
i pray to god, father forgive a nigga
i'm never gonna change, gonna change (ugh, yeah, i'm back)


smelling like patrón, singing dirty rap songs
tip-toeing in the crib like six in the morn'
every day it's the same, i said in blueprint that i'd never change
it's just a part of the game
respect me i'm a thug, i might cool out for a sec
but expect me to bug, it's in my blood
but if my chick leave me, she gon' leave me for something
she gon' leave me 'cause halle, she ain't gon' leave me for nothing
picture me getting up with something sleazy
something, something, so easy
you could take out of speed like nothing
soon as you finish cutting, you like, "leave me please"
not me, i need angelina joliezy comfort
so i ain't gon' make a move unless i got a plan b
that'll happen the day i have a baby by free
not to say that anything is wrong with free
just to say that ain't nothing wrong with me
if my hand's in the cookie jar, know one thing
i'ma take the cookie, not leave my ring
if my hand's in the cookie jar, know one thing
i'ma take—hahaha, y'all know what i mean


i try to pretend that i'm different, but in the end
we're all the same, all the same
i pray to god, father forgive a nigga
i'm never gonna change, gonna change
i try to pretend that i'm different, but in the end
we're all the same, all the same
i pray to god, father forgive a nigga
i'm never gonna change, gonna change

ugh, you lil' niggas ain't deep, you dumb
you niggas ain't gangsta, you gum—i chew lil' niggas
hock-ptui, spew lil' niggas
i can only view lil' niggas like lil' niggas
but in lieu of lil' niggas tryna play that boy
i "pew-pew!" lil' niggas with the latest toy
unlike you, lil' nigga, i'm a grown-ass man
big shoes to fill, nigga, grown-ass pants
probably hustled with your pops, go ask your parents
it's apparent you're staring at a legend who
put a few lil' niggas in their place before
tryna eat without saying their grace before
blasphemous bastard, get your faith restored
you're viewing your version of the lord, god—
mc, lil' nigga, applaud, or
forever burn in the fire that i spit at y'all
i rebuke you, lil' nigga, the meek shall perish
i'll roof you, lil' nigga, i'm a project terrorist
cute, you lil' niggas think you in my class
substitute, lil' niggas soon feel my wrath
i mute you, little nigga, you a lil' nigga
i child-abuse you, lil' nigga, i'm a ill nigga
now shoot, you lil' niggas, go somewhere and play
'cause the day i lose to you lil' niggas: no day


i try to pretend that i'm different, but in the end
we're all the same, all the same
i pray to god, father forgive a nigga
i'm never gonna change, gonna change
i try to pretend that i'm different, but in the end
we're all the same, all the same
i pray to god, father forgive a nigga
i'm never gonna change, gonna change
