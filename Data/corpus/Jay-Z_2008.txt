ain't i
i'm a... i'm a... i'm a
i'm a hustler's hustler
a gangster's gangster
i'm a rapper's rapper
your favorite, ain't i
ain't i, ain't i, ain't i


i'm still winning and i'm nowhere near finished
it's just the first inning
and i'm gunning for the pennant
and i been this, god made me
y'all hate me, y'all atheists
y'all safety is at risk
it's the return of the messiah
one and only hov
no i ain't god but i've been made in his mould
so when the story is told let it be said i refuse to fold
i only fold bread
i stood for the best, i owed no debt
i represent the hood til my dying breath
i took a pay cut to become an exec
so the next motherfucker can earn his paycheck
and even though these niggas talk greasy bout me
ask these niggas how they 'gon eat without me
ask these niggas if they want stats involved
and even if they don't like me, they respect the god




i'm hustler's poster child, i'm supposed to style
i ain't got nothing to prove, i'm supposed to smile
i ain't insecure, i'm vested in a piece of carol's daughter
i'm in sephora
bricks are insignificant to him
he's a grown man, you're an infant to him
take your baby money and burn, t-ha
i spent that on furniture
i got warhols on my hall's wall
i got basquiats in the lobby of my spot
i'm so sophisticatedly hood, s. carter cashmere premium goods
thousand dollars for the sneaks
timbo on the track, 250 for the beat
g4 back and forth to my floor seats
i spent a couple mil' just to lose to the heat



anything you aspire, to acquire i got
any gun you say, you fired
i shot any type of paraphernalia, i am the seller
i guess you're saying that's how i started roc-a-fella
feds all fed up
dea can't tell the dirty money from a rocawear sweater


whoever rap, you be doing that for practice, nigga
i'm in the twelve-step program
i ain't touched drugs in so long i'm a sober man
i'm clean as a whistle, official
got a way, i'm the king of all kings, it's official
i'm a hustler's hustler
a gangster's gangster
i'm a rapper's rapper
your favorite, ain't i
ain't i, ain't i, ain't i

when i wear billionaire boys club, it's more than gear
i don't wear it cause pharrell, i wear it 'cause i'm fo'real
(i see dead people)
i see benjamins and a billion other big head people
i'm a natural born hustler, marcy projects motherfucker
turned professional journalist reporting, live from the gutter
where girls, carry box-cutters
brothers shoot up with undercovers
screaming "fuck the world!" why? 'cause don't nobody love us
shawn carter, sean bell, what's the difference? do tell
50 shots or 50 mill', ain't no difference go to hell
so, brrrak, lick a shot for, brrrack obama, change gon' come or
i'ma buy the whole hood llamas on me
roc nation army, million strong and the mantra's gon' be

declaring, i'm free, bumping 'pac and the outlawz
i'm flyer than all outdoors, i ball out hard
i buy, champagne companies, i'm past buying out bars
but i do that, i'm so past, g5's and g4's
but i flew, back, back and forth like aaliyah (rest in peace to ya)
takes a nation of millions to hold us back
but when your boy reach a billion it's a wrap (off of rap?!) yeah!
roc nation it takes a nation to stop
i'm signing off, it's the hood's barack, brrrack!

long as i got a voice, you got a voice my nigga
yessir

bk stand up, brooklyn throw your hands up
if you with me, lick a shot for biggie


chillin' in the spot in my b-boy stance
don't make this four-fifth kick like bruce lee roy pants
you know i'm smarter than spock, for leonard nimoy fans
so this aluminum will foil your plans, that's how i'm doin' em man
i keep two in hand, in case i've been drinkin'
seeing double, i got one for you and your twin
i got a nickel for your thoughts, make your blood trickle
leave your smarts on the sidewalk, 'til the cops come and get you
i'm done playin' with you
the guns sprayin' with or without you
make your body whistle without you, young!
i'm still official without you
still that nigga all the bitches whisper about, ooh
he's so terrific, his lyrics like it's about you
you can't tell me that everything he spits that it's not true
i'm from a crack in the wall, a fighter with my back against wall
took a lighter, left my name in the hall, young!




grew up on lexington ave, my socks real high
moved to the marcy projects 'round the time i was five
had a great-grandmother in the heart of the 'stuy
so on the fourth of july, we would always stop by
man, i ran through the bush, bought pounds from "the dreads"
they had the best beef patties and cocoa bread
played the albee square mall 'round the time i was gettin' tall
where niggas would snatch your pockets, leave your change on the floor
18 regime round then, pink houses, fort greene niggas they ain't blend
wasn't safe on the a train, d, g or the f
decepticons, lo-life niggas snatch the polo off your chest
east new york, bushwick, fuck it, the whole bk
brownsville, where the warriors come out to play
nigga you better roll deep goin' through coney island
'cause it's one way out, nigga, one way in, nigga

chain snatchin', ain't have it, gotta get it
same shiddit, from brownsville to bainbriddidge
fatherless child, mama pulled double shifts

like oranges-es, i'm dangerous
please! tell me what the name of this shit


brooklyn we go hard, we go hard
brooklyn we go hard, we go hard
brooklyn we go hard, we go hard
brooklyn we go hard, we go hard
brooklyn we go hard, we go hard (b-r, o, o-k)
brooklyn we go hard, we go hard (l-y, n, come again)
brooklyn we go hard, we go hard (b-r, o, o-k)
brooklyn we go hard, we go hard (l-y, n, come again)


i father, i brooklyn-dodger them
i jack, i rob, i sin
aw, manâ€”i'm jackie robinson
'cept when i run base, i dodge the pen
lucky me, luckily, they didn't get me
now when i bring the nets, i'm the black branch rickey
from brooklyn corners, burnin' branches of sticky
spread love, biggie; brooklyn, hippie
i pity the fool with jewels like mr. t
with no history in my borough, they borrow
with no intentions of returnin' tomorrow
the sun don't come out for many, like annie
half-orphan, mama never had an abortion
papa sort of did; still, i managed to live
i go hard, i owe it all to the crib
now please tell me, what the fuck's harder than this?


brooklyn we go hard, we go hard
brooklyn we go hard, we go hard
brooklyn we go hard, we go hard
brooklyn we go hard, we go hard
brooklyn we go hard, we go hard (b-r, o, o-k)
brooklyn we go hard, we go hard (l-y, n, come again)
brooklyn we go hard, we go hard (b-r, o, o-k)
brooklyn we go hard, we go hard (l-y, n, come again)



in search of victory, she keeps eluding me
if only we could be together momentarily
we could make love, and make history
why wonâ€™t you visit me, until she visits me
iâ€™ll be stuck with her sister, her name is defeat
she gives me agony, so much agony
she brings me so much pain, so much misery
like missing your last shot and falling to your knees
as the crowd screams, for the other team
i've practiced so hard for this moment victory donâ€™t leave
i know what this means, iâ€™m stuck in this routine
whole new different day, but the same old things
all i got is dreams, but nobody else could see
nobody else believes, nobody else but me
where are you victory? i need you desperately
not just for the moment, to make history


so now iâ€™m flirting with death
hustling like a g, while victory wasnâ€™t watching
took chances repeatedly
as a teenage boy, before acne
before i got proactive, i couldnâ€™t face she
i just threw on my hoodie and headed to the streets
i swear i met success, we lived together shortly
a success is like lust, she's good for the touch
she's good for the moment, but sheâ€™s never enough
everybodyâ€™s had her, sheâ€™s nothing like v
a success is all i got, unfortunately
but iâ€™m burning down the block, hopin' in and out of v's
but something tells me that thereâ€™s much more to see
before i get killed, cause i canâ€™t get robbed
so before me, success and death mÃ©nage
i gotta get lost, i gotta find v
we gotta be together to make history


now victory is mine, she tastes so sweet
sheâ€™s my trophy wife, she's coming with me
we'll have a baby who stutters repeatedly
we'll name him history, he'll repeat after me
heâ€™s my legacy, son of my hard work
future of my past, heâ€™ll explain who i be
rank me amongst the greats, either 1, 2 or 3
if i ainâ€™t number one then i failed you victory
ainâ€™t in it for the fame, that dies within weeks
ainâ€™t in it for the money, canâ€™t take it when you leave
i wanna be remembered long after you grieve
long after iâ€™m gone, long after i breathe
i leave all i am, in the hands of history
that's my last will testimony
this is much more than a song, itâ€™s a baby shower
iâ€™ve been waiting for this hour, history, you're ours
