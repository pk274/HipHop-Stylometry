teacher-teacher, i'm trying to unteach ya
all the shit they taught y'all, they got you all in the bleachers
when you front row at the knicks game, those the spike lees
you front row everywhere, you in the h.o.v.'s
jordan 1's and dungarees
and that's just the half of my warpath
make a million another million let my niggas make a million
'til we all check a billion, shit it's just the way i'm feeling
we have yet to see a ceiling, we just top what we top
cause the bars don't struggle when the struggle don't stop


just fuck up this world

arm, leg, leg, arm, head – this is god body
knowledge, wisdom, freedom, understanding, we just want our equality
food, clothing, shelter, help a nigga find some peace
happiness for a gangsta, ain't no love in these streets
conspiracy theorist screaming illuminati
they can't believe this much skill is in the human body
he's 6'2", how the fuck he fit in a new bugatti?
aw, fuck it, you got me
question religion, question it all
question existence until them questions are solved
meanwhile this heretic, i be out in marrakesh
morocco smoking hashish with my fellowship
y'all dwell on devil shit, i'm in a diablo
yellow shit, color of jell-o shit
hello bitch, it's me again
fresh in my easter clothes feeling like jesus and


that's me in the corner, that's me in the spotlight
losing my religion, losing my religion


getting ghost in the ghost, can you see me? can you see me?
have mercy on a judas, angel wings on a 'ghini
i'm secular, tell the hecklers seckle down
y'all religion creates division like my maybach partition
and god is my chauffeur, boy they love hova
from the south side of chi to brooklyn where i growed up
i confess, god in the flesh
live among the serpents, turn arenas into churches
i'm like michael, recycle, these are not 16's
these are verses from the bible
tell that preacher he's a preacher, i'm a motherfuckin' prophet
smoke a tree of knowledge, drink from a gold chalice
you gotta love it, i arrive at the pearly gates
i had luggage, meaning i had baggage
niggas asking me questions, i don't answer to these busters
only god could judge us, motherfuckers, uh



“i work and work 'til i'm half-dead and i hear people saying
"she's getting old," and what do i get? a daughter
who cares as much about the beautiful dresses i give her
as she cares about me!”


let's do this for these babies
mercedes truck, fuck, houses on acres
blatantly ballin' on hd
y'all need to step up y'all av
life changed again i was already taking off
my flight changed again
slight change of winds
it's barely 12 noon and my wife changed again
baby need pampers
daddy need at least three weeks in the hamptons
please don't judge me, only hugged the block
i thought my daddy didn't love me
my baby getting chubby
cue that stevie wonder music, aww, isn't she lovely?
now i'm staring at her praying that things don't get ugly
and i'm stuck in that old cycle like wife leaves hubby
fuck joint custody, i need a joint right now
just the thought alone fucks with me


high on life
i could die from the fall, imagine if i hit the floor
apologies in order to blue ivy my daughter
if it was up to me, you would be with me, sort of like daddy dearest


"don't fuck with me fellas. this ain't my first time at the rodeo."


i dream filthy (my mom and pops)
mixed me with jamaican (rum and whiskey, what a set off)
and i know i'm not perfect baby
i done been through so much trauma, it gonna be hard to reverse it
with some doctors and some nurses maybe
teach me on how to treat a lady, open doors on the 'cedes
this relationship shit is complicated
all i know if we ain't speaking everyday, i fucking hate it
i don't wanna duplicate it
i seen my mom and pop drive each other mothafuckin' crazy
and i got that nigga blood in me
i got his ego and his temper, all is missing is the drugs in me


high on life
i could die from the fall, imagine if i hit the floor
apologies in order to blue ivy my daughter
if it was up to me, you would be with me, sort of like daddy dearest


"no... wire... hangers... ever!"


father never taught me how to be a father, treat a mother
i don't wanna have to just repeat another leave another
baby with no daddy want no momma drama
i just wanna take her back to a time when everything was calmer
out in paris on a terrace watching the eiffel tower
and a ferris wheel yet and still, nothing could prepare us
for the beauty that you be blue be
looking in your eyes is like a mirror, have to face my fears
cheer up, why can't you just be happy
without these back and forth thoughts, you too much like your daddy
badly i just wanna spent more time with him
sadly life wouldn't let me get around with him
now i got my own daughter, taught her how to take her first steps
cut the cord watch her take her first breath
and i'm trying and i'm lying if i said i wasn't scared
but in life and death if i ain't here


high on life
i could die from the fall, imagine if i hit the floor
apologies in order to blue ivy my daughter
if it was up to me, you would be with me, sort of like daddy dearest

i die for my niggas and i love my cub, hope that's not fucked up
i got a problem with the handouts, i took the man route

no guilt in giving clear a nigga conscience out
no guilt in receiving, every thing within reason
can't see it taking food out my little monster's mouth
that'll drive me gaga
run up in your momma's house, two nickels, one dime
manslaughter charges, the lawyer, knocked it down
