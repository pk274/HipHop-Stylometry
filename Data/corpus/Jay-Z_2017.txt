look, i apologize, often womanize
took for my child to be born, see through a woman's eyes
took for these natural twins to believe in miracles
took me too long for this song, i don't deserve you
i harassed you out in paris
"please come back to rome, you make it home"
we talked for hours when you were on tour
"please pick up the phone, pick up the phone!"
i said: "don't embarrass me" instead of "be mine"
that was my proposal for us to go steady
that was your 21st birthday
you matured faster than me, i wasn't ready
so i apologize
i seen the innocence leave your eyes
i still mourn its death and
i apologize for all the stillborns
'cause i wasn't present, your body wouldn't accept it
i apologize to all the women whom i toyed with your emotions
'cause i was emotionless
and i apologize 'cause at your best, you are love
and because i fall short of what i say i'm all about
your eyes leave with the soul that your body once housed
and you stare blankly into space
thinkin' of all the time, you wasted it on all this basic shit
so i apologize


i apologize
our love was one for the ages and i contained us
and all this ratchet shit and we more expansive
not meant to cry and die alone in these mansions
or sleep with our back turned
we supposed to vacay 'til our backs burn
we're supposed to laugh 'til our heart stops
and then meet in a space where the dark stop
and let love light the way
like the men before me, i cut off my nose to spite my face
i never wanted another woman to know
something about me that you didn't know
i promised, i cried, i couldn't hold
i suck at love, i think i need a do-over
i will be emotionally available if i invited you over
i stew over; "what if—"
"you over my shit?"


and if my children knew
i don't even know what i would do
if they ain't look at me the same
i would prob'ly die with all the shame
"you did what with who?"
what good is a ménage à trois when you have a soulmate?
"you risked that for blue?"
if i wasn't a superhero in your face
my heart breaks for the day i have to explain my mistakes
and the mask goes away
and santa claus is fake
and you go online and see
for blue's tooth, the tooth fairy didn't pay



uh, letter to my dad that i never wrote
speeches i prepared that i never spoke
words on a paper that i never read
proses never penned, they stayed in my head
jotted on dotted lines, "i'ma fight you, nigga"
from stories that i heard, i'm just like you, nigga
must've been some pain in your past, too
must've been a karma that was past due
must it be the energy that passed through
must've been a pastor, many snafus
started a good man, you married my mama
i was in her belly, you hurried that summer
she had two kids from a previous mister
one family, i don't believe in half-sisters
never treated my brother like a step, pop
remembered the many lessons when we stepped out


what was you preparing us—
for?


did you see the runt as the front-runner
leader of the pack, you see that in your youngins
what ancestors did you summon to the summit
to give me what i needed, what you need to take from 'em
the tsunamis that i swum in to become in
had the cable with the anchor for the places that i sunk in
unc in a better place but you couldn't function
shot junk in your arms, more than your veins was punctured
i punted on feelings, 'cause you said you was coming
you couldn't kick the habit, i wish you said something
you can't avenge these many sins with your own hands
you wanna make god laugh, just tell him your plans
who would've thought i'd be the dad i never had
be the husband i've become, usually nothing come from that
i forgive you as i live through the beautiful present of the past
i'm just thankful that i get all these gifts to unwrap


what was you preparing us—
for?

and show up at the funeral, complete with blank stares
invisible ink, i had to read things that wasn't there
memories may sneak down my cheek
but i could see a side-eye in my sleep


ready for it, deep breath, fill up the void
eyes, open them up, take off the coins
still stingin' from tears, they try to see you
i'm ready for earth, ready for real
solipsistic, admit it, i see you there

you'll never be enough, let's just keep it real, jay-z
fuck jay-z, i mean, you shot your own brother
how can we know if we can trust jay-z?
and you know better, nigga, i know you do
but you gotta do better, boy, you owe it to blue
you had no father, you had the armor
but you got a daughter, gotta get softer
die jay-z, this ain't back in the days
you don't need an alibi, jay-z
cry jay-z, we know the pain is real
but you can't heal what you never reveal
what's up, jay-z? you know you owe the truth
to all the youth that fell in love with jay-z
you got people you love you sold drugs to
you got high on the life, that shit drugged you
you walkin' around like you invincible
you dropped outta school, you lost your principles
i know people backstab you, i felt bad too
but this 'fuck everybody' attitude ain't natural
but you ain't a saint, this ain't kumbaye
but you got hurt because you did cool by 'ye
you gave him twenty million without blinkin'
he gave you twenty minutes on stage, fuck was he thinkin'?
"fuck wrong with everybody?" is what you sayin'
but if everybody's crazy, you're the one that's insane
crazy how life works
you got a knot in your chest, imagine how a knife hurts
you stabbed un over some records
your excuse was "he was talkin' too reckless!"
let go your ego over your right shoulder
your left is sayin', "finish your breakfast!"
you egged solange on
knowin' all along, all you had to say you was wrong
you almost went eric benét
let the baddest girl in the world get away
i don't even know what else to say
nigga, never go eric benét!
i don't even know what you woulda done
in the future other niggas playin' football with your son
you woulda lost it
13 bottles of ace of spade, what it did to boston
nah, jay-z
bye, jay-z

take those monies and spread 'cross families
my sisters, hattie and lou, the nephews, cousins and tt
eric, the rest to b for whatever she wants to do
she might start an institute, she might put poor kids through school
my stake in roc nation should go to you
leave a piece for your siblings to give to their children too
tidal, the champagne, d'ussé, i'd like to see
a nice peace-fund ideas from people who look like we
we gon' start a society within a society
that's major, just like the negro league
there was a time america wouldn't let us ball
those times are now back, just now called afro-tech
generational wealth, that's the key
my parents ain't have shit, so that shift started with me
my mom took her money, she bought me bonds
that was the sweetest thing of all time, uh


legacy, legacy, legacy, legacy
black excellence baby, you gon' let 'em see
legacy, legacy, legacy, legacy
black excellency, baby, let 'em see


i remember, like, listenin' to wu-tang
and niggas like, "your seed married his seed, married my seed"
that's how we keep carter money all in the family


you see, my father, son of a preacher man
whose daughter couldn't escape the reach of the preacher's hand
that charge of energy set all the carters back
it took all these years to get to zero in fact
i hated religion 'cause here was this christian
he was preachin' on sundays, versus how he was livin' monday
someday i forgive him
'cause strangely our division led to multiple religions
i studied muslim, buddhist, and christians
and i was runnin' from him, he was givin' me wisdom
see how the universe works?
it takes my hurt and help me find more of myself
it's a gift and a curse
that's called the red queen's race


you run this hard just to stay in place
keep up the pace, baby
keep up the pace
you run this hard just to stay in place


legacy, legacy, legacy, legacy
black excellence, you gon' let 'em see
legacy, legacy, legacy, legacy
black excellency, baby, let 'em see


yeah, uh
vacay the pain away, uh
smoking the pain away, uh

look at all we been through since last august
skating through the rumors like, "aw, shit!"
still came back, fucked up the red carpet
shows how big your heart is
on the run, we took a hundred together
more than the money, it was the fact that we done it together
uh, healing in real time
song cry to resentment, that was real crying
bonnie and clyde things, we hold it down
had we surrendered then, that'd be the real crime
got through it, got blessed times two with it
new bel-air estates with four pools in it
i told my bro, "you gotta go home," over vino
goodfella, don't gamble with your life, this ain't casino
cost him two mill' plus the child support
we'll get the money back, but not the child support
it's getting too late, we can't afford mistakes
woulda broke me down had you got away
it woulda broke me up, you took my child away
i'm glad we found a way
sexin' the pain away
vacay the pain away
drinking the pain away
smoking the pain away


too perfect not to wonder (yeah)
if we created a flame that would warm us 'til it’s over
we invented lovers from company for the summer
i was many faces, but at least i was willing to change
i was worried that the way i was would end me up alone
shit feels so beautiful, don't you agree?
i was worried that the way i was would end me up alone


our external reality is an opportunity to heal our internal upset
let's build a cathedral these evils couldn't fuck with
i wanna spend my saturdays and my latter-days
eating sundaes and enjoying mondays
not worrying about what none say


yoncé, all on this mouth like liquor
uh, that my nigga, uh, that my nigga
over everything, each of our mood swings
whenever attitudes change, like a mood ring
ain't nothing like somebody that get ya, baby, i get ya
let's go through this thing, come out stronger, the golden journey
broken is better than new, that's kintsukuroi
you're fine china, i'm a bull and ball in a china shop
i promise to repair with gold each bowl i drop
be grateful for whatever comes because each has been sent
from a guy from beyond, that's what rumi say
"never go to bed mad," that's what my ummi say
it always took her less to say more
i always thought she was an angel, now i'm sure, sure

live from bedford-stuyvesant
the livest one representin' bk to the fullest
bastards duckin' when hov be buckin'
chicken-heads be cluckin'


uhh, back when ratchet was a ratchet and a vixen was a vixen
and jam master jay was alive i-i, i was mixin'
cookin' coke in the kitchen
back when rodman was a piston
mike was losin' to isiah, but he soon would get his sixth one
gave birth to my verbal imagination
assume a virtue if you have not
or better yet here's a verse from hamlet
"lord, we know who we are
yet we know not what we may be"
so maybe i'm the one or maybe i'm crazy
i'm from marcy houses, where the boys die by the thousand
back when pam was on martin
yeah, that's where it all started
when denzel was blottin' carpet, i'll pack a… nine millimeter
when slick rick made "mona lisa"

came through the bushes smellin' like roses
i need a trophy just for that
old brooklyn, not this new shit, shit feel like a spoof
fat laces in your shoe, i'm talkin' bustin' off the roof, uh
hold a uzi vertical, let the thing smoke
