you was a college student abusing the credit union
the music was way too loud, the tuition was fuckin stupid
and me i was runnin' wild hittin' licks in my mothers' buick
confusing, you like my style even though i was broke and doing
stick em ups, you wanna pick em up
inside your civic plus the difference was
i wasn't rich as fuck you still would depend on us
and i missed the crush that we had every time winter december come
and we had tempers and arguments, disagreements and senses from
cupid himself, and i'm shootin' himself
and the paramedics won't come even if you scream for help
don't let love die, you regroovin' yourself
and i'm losing now too looking at you boo hoo from what's dealt
so as i reminisce the coupon that we used to split at rally's
on your mothers couch your little brother in the alley
you say k. dot your page got that pay that birdman and jay got
one day you'll reap what you sow, now i reap for us both
that's one hunnid
