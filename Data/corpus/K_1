i gotta break your fuckin' heart
i gotta climb these fuckin' charts (i gotta climb 'em)
i gotta do something that's innovative, creative, just to create a
legacy before death do us part, i gotta spend one
summer in tijuana with tia and tia's momma
breakfast in bed is head with plenty carne asada
i gotta, i gotta find me a wife to elope
i got aâ€”i got a fine, 'cause i ain't wanna vote, i promise
i know the history of those who died
for the rights for me to survive but those who lied
to the minority will make 'em turn inside they grave
i can easily pretend like y'all but that's not me
i gotta spread the truth even when the truth can hurt
the youths need to know every detail about this earth
the devil controls it, so before you scrutinize how i feel
ask god if them polls important, the end is near
