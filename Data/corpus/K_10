uh, martin had a dream
martin had a dream
kendrick have a dream


all my life i want money and power
respect my mind or die from lead shower
i pray my dick get big as the eiffel tower
so i can fuck the world for seventy-two hours


goddamn i feel amazin', damn, i'm in the matrix
my mind is livin' on cloud nine and this 9 is never on vacation
start up that maserati and – vroom-vroom! – i'm racin'
poppin' pills in the lobby and i pray they don't find her naked
and i pray you niggas is hatin', shooters go after judas
jesus christ, if i live life on my knees ain't no need to do this
park it in front of lueders, next to that church's chicken
all you pussies is losers, all my niggas is winnin', screamin'—


all my life i want money and power
respect my mind or die from lead shower
i pray my dick get big as the eiffel tower
so i can fuck the world for seventy-two hours


goddamn i got bitches (okay), damn i got bitches (okay)
damn i got bitches: wifey, girlfriend and mistress
all my life i want money and power
respect my mind or die from lead shower


i've got twenty-five lighters on my dresser, yessir
put fire to that ass, body cast on a stretcher
and her body got that ass that a ruler couldn't measure
and it make me cum fast, but i never get embarrassed
and i recognize you have what i've been wantin' since that record
that adina howard had pop it fast to impress her
she rollin', i'm holdin' my scrotum imposin'
this voice here is golden, so fuck y'all, i goes in, and—


all my life i want money and power
respect my mind or die from lead shower
i pray my dick get big as the eiffel tower
so i can fuck the world for seventy-two hours


goddamn i got bitches, damn i got bitches
damn i got bitches: wifey, girlfriend and mistress
all my life i want money and power
respect my mind or, nigga, it's go time


i roll in dough with a good grind
and i run that ho with a baton
that's a relay race with a bouquet
they say, "k, you goin' marry mines"
biatch! no way, biatch! no way
biatch! no way, biatch! okay
i'm never livin' life confined
it's a failure even if i'm blind
i can tell you who, what, when, where
how to sell your game right on time
biatch! go play, biatch! go play
biatch! go play
biatch, i look like o. j.​
killin' everything from pussy to a mothafuckin' hit-boy beat
she pussy poppin' and i got options like an audible, i be
c-o-m-p-t-o-n, i win, then ball at your defeat
c-o-m-p-t-o-n, my city, mobbin' in the street, yellin'—


all my life i want money and power
respect my mind or die from lead shower
i pray my dick get big as the eiffel tower
so i can fuck the world for seventy-two hours


goddamn i got bitches, damn i got bitches
damn i got bitches, wifey, girlfriend and mistress
all my life i want money and power
respect my mind or die from lead shower


let it run, ali
