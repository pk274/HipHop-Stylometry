fuckin' up the premises, i been a dick
ain't beneficial, i'm 'bout to issue your nemesis
evacuate the buildin' when i come through
evaluate your feelin's when i come through
tire marks and gun smoke stories
ogs reminisce and show glory
he said, "nigga, i'm hopin' you make a way out
before i make this mac-11 do it for me"
i know responsibility weighin' down on my shoulders
summertime always the coldest
niggas do you dirty like the projects
25? then you are the oldest
this is the feelin' you get when you ride
'til the wheels fall off and there's no mo' drive
i see the fear when i look in your eyes
you should execute or x out and expire
