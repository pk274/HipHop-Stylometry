alright, here we go, third take
real quick, ali
mmm


got me breathing with dragons
i'll crack the egg in your basket, you bastard
i'm marilyn manson with madness
now just imagine the magic i light to asses
don't ask for your favorite rapper
(he dead), yes, sir (amen), church
(he dead), i killed him (amen), bitch


and this is rigor mortis and it's gorgeous when you die
ali recorded and i'm morpheus, the matrix of my mind
i'm out the orbit, you an orphan and a hairdresser combined
i'm on the toilet when i rhyme, if you the shit, then i decline
i climax where you begin and then i end on cloud nine
and that's important when you morph into an angel in the sky
and don't be forging all my signatures, my listeners reply
and tell me that you biting style, you got a hell of an appetite
and i'ma be here for a while, just buckle up before the ride
or knuckle up if you can fight, we always making 'em duck or die
a suit and tie is suitable and usual in suicide
csi just might investigate this fucking parasite
(he dead, amen)
that's what they telling me
aim it at your celebrity, this is studio felony
ferragami so many and cool enough for the '70s
nigga, payback's a bitch, and bitch, you been livin' in debt with me
dead 'em all and especially
leave a call on his mother voicemail that say that he rest in peace
bigger chopper the recipe
wrestling? that's irrelevant, rather rest at your residence
whistling to the melody, couldn't think of a better d
better be on your p and q, it's just me, jay rock, soul, and q
solar system and barbecue, nothing else you can do


(he dead), yup-yup (amen), i killed him
(he dead, amen), amen
got me breathing with dragons
i'll crack the egg in your basket, you bastard
i'm marilyn manson, don't ask for your favorite rapper
(he dead), yup-yup (amen), i know
(he dead), for sure (amen), amen
got me breathing with dragons
i'll crack the egg in your basket, you bastard
i'm marilyn manson, don't ask for your favorite rapper

i wrapped him and made him casper, i capture the likes of nasa
my pedigree to fly past ya, i'll pass the weed to the pastor
we all are sinners, won't you send us to bible study faster?
your hypocritist reaction a blasphemy, i assassin my casualty
and it's casually done, and tell 'em my salary come
in lump sum one hundreds, don't talk to me 'bout no money
the sun is under my feet, and i come in peace to compete
i don't run if you'd rather leap, my statistics go up in weeks
and i go visit the nearest creek, and i get busy on many mc
really ballistic, anybody can see
any assistance, everybody deceased
some persistence, recognize i be
really too vicious, the permanent beast
and the demolition breaking up the street
better partition, better dot your t
and i gon' mention how the far you see
putting my dick in the rap industry
everybody bitching, getting mad at me
recognize kendrick in the battery
and i'm charged up, and the catastrophe
is charged up, and the audacity
of y'all fucks never could hassle me
and y'all luck just ran out, you'll see


(he dead), yup-yup (amen), i know
(he dead), for sure (amen), amen
got me breathing with dragons
i'll crack the egg in your basket, you bastard
i'm marilyn manson, don't ask for your favorite rapper
(he dead), yup-yup (amen), i know
(he dead), for sure (amen), amen
