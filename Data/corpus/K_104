welcome to vigilante, '80s, so don't you ask me
i'm hungry, my body's antsy, i rip through your fuckin' pantry
peelin' off like a xanny, examine my orchestra
granny said when i'm old enough, i'll be sure to be all i can be
you niggas marcus camby, washed up
pussy, fix your panties, i'm mr. marcus, you gettin' fucked, uh
you ain't heard nothin' harder since daddy kane
take it in vain, vicodins couldn't ease the pain
lightning bolts hit your body, you thought it rained
not a cloud in sight, just the shit that i write
strong enough to stand in front of a travelin' freight train, are you trained?
to go against dracula, draggin' the record industry by my fangs
ak clips, money clips, and gold chains
you walk around with a p90 like it's the '90s
bullet to your temple, your homicide'll remind me


that compton crip niggas ain't nothin' to fuck with
bompton pirus ain't nothin' to fuck with
compton éses ain't nothin' to fuck with
but they fuck with me, and bitch, i love it
woop-di-woop, woop-di-woop-woop, woop-di-woop
woop-di-woop, woop-di-woop-woop (california dungeons)
woop-di-woop, woop-di-woop-woop, woop-di-woop
woop-di-woop, woop-di-woop-woop (california dungeons)


let's hit the county buildin', gotta cash my check
spend it all on a forty-ounce to the neck
and in retrospect, i remember december being the hottest
squad cars, neighborhood wars, and stolen mazdas
i tell you motherfuckers that life is full of hydraulics
up and down, get a six-four, better know how to drive it
i'm drivin' on e with no license or registration
heart racin', racin' past johnny because he's racist
1987, the children of ronald reagan
rake the leaves off your front porch with a machine blowtorch (i'm really out here, my nigga)
he blowin' on stress, hopin' to ease the stress (like, really out here)
he coppin' some blow, hopin' that it can stretch
newborn massacre
hoppin' out the passenger with calendars 'cause your day comin'
run him down and then he gun him down, i'm hopin' that you fast enough
even the legs of michael johnson don't mean nothin', because


compton crip niggas ain't nothin' to fuck with
bompton pirus ain't nothin' to fuck with
compton éses ain't nothin' to fuck with
but they fuck with me, and bitch, i love it
woop-di-woop, woop-di-woop-woop, woop-di-woop
woop-di-woop, woop-di-woop-woop (california dungeons)
woop-di-woop, woop-di-woop-woop, woop-di-woop
woop-di-woop, woop-di-woop-woop (california dungeons)


woah, woah, woah-woah-woah-woah
woah, woah, woah-woah-woah-woah
woah, woah, woah-woah-woah-woah
woah, woah, woah-woah-woah-woah
