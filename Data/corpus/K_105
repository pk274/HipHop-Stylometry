everybody know i spit that other shit
shit that make you duck for cover shit
shit that make you hop out your seat and slap your mother shit
especially when drop drop the beat
i drop jewels like my nuts dropped out of my briefs
jump in the booth and shatter every rapper's dream
they jump in a sauna because i killed their self-esteem
that's a jab, you should bob and weave
like pam when martin pulled jokes out his sleeve
i go in studio sessions and feel like a nerd
cause i'm the only nigga there not smoking no herb
you telling me the kush make you think on level four?
i'm on five, you saying that i can level more?
in high school, my teachers thought i was smoking stress
didn't know my eyes low cause of genetic defects
i stimulate my mind every time i think about the end of time
creation of man, and columbine


bet you think that this some high shit that i wrote
probably think i'm off the kush or the hydro
(nope) i don't even smoke, i don't even smoke
i don't even smoke, i don't even smoke
i really appreciate that you share your indo
but a sip of henny is the farthest i would go
i don't even smoke, i don't even smoke
i don't even smoke, i don't even smoke


look, nowadays everybody think they're big chiefers
just cause they heard that new tape from wiz khalifa
knowing damn well they can't hit the sour
they're new booties, they probably need baby powder
my skill shower over your city for 40 days
40 nights, off the chain, like freedom of slaves
before you get it twisted, like 40 gays
my flow worth the earth, that's not to be appraised
those the type of lines that i'm talking 'bout
you know the type of rhymes you don't talk about
copy my session on a disc when the session ends
so my momma can have it and play it for her friends
brag on me, like "my son's 'bout to win
somehow, someday, and i don't care when"
i might hit the gin once a month
i'll let you inhale, like an atheist


bet you think that this some high shit that i wrote
probably think i'm off the kush or the hydro
(nope) i don't even smoke, i don't even smoke
i don't even smoke, i don't even smoke
i really appreciate that you share your indo
but a sip of henny is the farthest i would go
i don't even smoke, i don't even smoke
i don't even smoke, i don't even smoke


i'll take you back to the 9th grade
when dough boy had me high for 4 days
that's my nigga, he a street nigga
probably in your hood, fucking up your street, nigga
but anyway i think it was some purple
told me "don't hit it hard because it'll hurt you"
i didn't listen, i was floating like the rose parade
swear to god a nigga seen some flying fishes
that was the vegas trip, hooters sponsored
the same time i start writing like a fucking monster
i'm frankenstein every time this mothafucker ponders
just underline every letter, capital k-d-o-t
laying it flat out, like a tire with slow leaks
now what you 'bout? nothing huh
am i a square cause i don't puff a square?
are my raps too blunt to hit the blunt? yeah


bet you think that this some high shit that i wrote
probably think i'm off the kush or the hydro
(nope) i don't even smoke, i don't even smoke
i don't even smoke, i don't even smoke
i really appreciate that you share your indo
but a sip of henny is the farthest i would go
i don't even smoke, i don't even smoke
i don't even smoke, i don't even smoke


h.o.c., h.o.c

(bitch i'm blowed!)
