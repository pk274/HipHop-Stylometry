lord god, i come to you a sinner
and i humbly repent for my sins
i believe that jesus is lord
i believe that you raised him from the dead
i would ask that jesus come to my life
and be my lord and savior
i receive jesus to take control of my life
and that i may live for him from this day forth
thank you, lord jesus, for saving me with your precious blood
in jesus' name, amen


i met her at this house party on el segundo and central
she had the credentials of strippers in atlanta
ass came with a hump, from the jump she was a camel
i want to ride like arabians, push an '04 mercedes-benz
"hello, my name is kendrick," she said, "no, you're handsome"
whispered in my ear, disappeared, then found her dancin'
ciara had played in the background
the parade music we made had us all wearin' shades now, cool
"where you stay?" she said, "down the street from dominguez high"
okay, i know that's borderline compton or paramount
"well, is it compton?" "no," she replied
then quickly start battin' her eyes
i strictly had wanted her thighs around me
seventeen with nothin' but pussy stuck on my mental
my motive was rather sinful, "what you tryna get into?"
she didn't tell, just gave me her nextel
dropped the number, we chirped the whole summer, and, well
the summer had passed, and now i'm likin' her
conversation we havin' probably enticin' her
who can imagine? maybe my actions'll end up wifin' her
love or lust, regardless, we'll fuck 'cause the trife in us
it's deep-rooted, the music of bein' young and dumb
is never muted, in fact, it's much louder where i'm from
we know a lot 'bout each other, her mother was a crack addict
she live with her granny and her younger two brothers
her favorite cousin demetrius is irrepetible
family history of gangbangin' did make me skeptical
but not enough to stop me from gettin' a nut
"i wanna come over, what's up?"
that's what i told her soon as this episode
of martin go off, i'm tryna get off
i was in heat like a cactus
my tactics of bein' thirsty probably could hurt me
but fuck it, i got some heart
grabbed my mama keys, hopped in the car, then, oh boy
so now i'm down rosecrans in a caravan
passin' alameda, my gas meter in need of a pump
i got enough to get me through the traffic jam
at least i hope, 'cause my pockets broke as a promise, man
i'm thinkin' 'bout that sex
thinkin' 'bout her thighs or maybe kissin' on her neck or maybe what position's next
sent a picture of her titties, blowin' up my texts
i looked at 'em and almost ran my front bumper into corvette
enthused by the touch of a woman, she's a masseuse
and i'm a professional pornstar when off the goose
i had a fifth in the trunk like curtis jackson for ransom
i'm hopin' to get her loose like an uncle luke anthem
i'm two blocks away, two hundred and fifty feet
and six steps from where she stay, she wavin' me 'cross the street
i pulled up, a smile on my face, and then i see
two niggas, two black hoodies, i froze as my phone rang
