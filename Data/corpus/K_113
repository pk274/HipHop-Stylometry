kendrick lamar, plain old kendrick the average joe
but not the average flow, just willing to make it, ock
that boy’s bacon, he got relations with satan, pops
this type of greatness is well-awaiting the fatal shots
now what you know about them westside streets?
we was five like deep, rapping the best of mobb deep
rapping my best in my sleep, that’s if i ever slept
countin’ bars while you countin’ sheep, you lookin’ at the best
god-given, i’m been spitting since pokémon cards and yo-yos
sauconies girbaud jeans, when wayne made “bling-bling” i was hip-hopping
makin’ ‘em hop, have a pogo
let’s get this cream, cold stones
i’m fallin’ off, hold on
when peeling off, bmx bikes
ducking shots that was barking real dmx-like
a pizza and a cold sprite
peace to the world
i close my door and make love to the beat
then fuck your girl
that was k.dot then


i give you my album in replacement of detox
i drop shit with ease to let y’all eavesdrop
on my style, eyes of an owl as they watch
throw in that towel or get thrown in a ditch


you flow don’t exist, we co-exist with the ufos
goddamnit, stranded on planets that you don’t know
the aliens panic, pack they bags, they hit the road
the truth, the phone booth, the greatness take its toll
