miscellaneous minds are never explainin' their minds
devilish grin for my alias aliens to respond
peddlin' sin, thinkin' maybe when you get old you realize
i'm not gonna fold or demise
i don't smoke crack, motherfucker, i sell it!
bitch, everything i rap is a quarter piece to your melon
so if you have a relapse, just relax and pop in my disc
don't you pop me no fuckin' pill
i'ma pop you, then give you this


tell flex to drop a bomb on this shit
so many bombs, ring the alarm, like vietnam on this shit
so many bombs, make farrakhan think that saddam in this bitch
one at a time, i line them up
and bomb on they mom while she watchin' the kids
i'm in a destruction mode if the gold exists
i'm important like the pope, i'm a muslim on pork
i'm makaveli's offspring, i'm the king of new york
king of the coast; one hand, i juggle 'em both
the juggernaut's all in your jugular, you take me for jokes
live in the basement, church pews, and funeral faces
cartier bracelets for my women friends, i'm in vegas
who the fuck y'all thought it's supposed to be?
if phil jackson came back, still no coachin' me
i'm uncoachable, i'm unsociable, fuck y'all clubs!
fuck y'all pictures! your instagram can gobble these nuts!
gobble dick up 'til you hiccup, my big homie kurupt
this the same flow that put the rap game on a crutch
(west, west, west, west, west, west)
i've seen niggas transform like villain decepticons
mollies probably turn these niggas to fuckin' lindsay lohan
a bunch of rich-ass white girls lookin' for parties
playin' with barbies
wreck the porsche before you give them the car key
judgement to the monarchy, blessings to paul mccartney
you called me a black beatle, i'm either that or a marley
i don't smoke crack, motherfucker, i sell it!
i'm dressed in all black, this is not for the fan of elvis
i'm aimin' straight for your pelvis
you can't stomach me? you plan on stumpin' me?
bitch, i’ve been jumped before you put a gun on me
bitch, i put one on yours, i'm sean connery
james bonding with none of you niggas
climbin' 100 mil in front of me
and i'm gonna get it even if you're in the way
and if you're in it, better run for pete's sake
i heard the barbershops be in great debates all the time
'bout who's the best mc: kendrick, jigga, and nas
eminem, andré 3000; the rest of y'all
new niggas just new niggas, don't get involved
and i ain't rockin' no more designer shit
white t’s and nike cortez, this red corvette's anonymous
i'm usually homeboys with the same niggas i'm rhymin' with
but this is hip-hop, and them niggas should know what time it is
and that goes for jermaine cole, big k.r.i.t., wale
pusha t, meek millz, a$ap rocky, drake
big sean, jay electron', tyler, mac miller
i got love for you all, but i'm tryna murder you niggas
tryna make sure your core fans never heard of you niggas
they don't wanna hear not one more noun or verb from you niggas
what is competition? i'm tryna raise the bar high
who tryna jump and get it? you're better off tryna skydive
out the exit window of five g5's with five grand
with your granddad as the pilot, he drunk as fuck, tryna land
with the hand full of arthritis and poppin' prosthetic leg
bumpin' pac in the cockpit so the shit that pops in his head
is an option of violence, someone heard the stewardess said
that your parachute is a latex condom hooked to a dread
west coast
