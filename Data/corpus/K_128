you’re stumbling all over town, you drink till you drown
you keep on threatening to bring me down
you don’t make the rules, you drunk old fool
see, you don’t scare me, you’re just crying wolf
whoa, whoa, go on and cry boy, whoa, whoa, go on and cry boy
whoa, whoa, go on and cry boy, whoa, whoa, go on and cry, cry boy
cry, cry boy, cry boy
nobody knows what you’re saying (i mean, you need to)
i know the game that you’re playing (i mean, you need to)


don’t forget about us, don’t forget about trust
don’t forget about the kinkiness of playin' with the cuffs on a bedspring
penetrate the loud screams, echo in the hallway is a must
i could never let go if i wanna whore, duck, away from your anatomy
the agony is such a pain i could never endure even if i had the cure
with the pure, sweet morphine touch, i mean, i cannot deny my demise to lies
that interrupted our future, i mean, if i compromise, will you improvise?
please don’t pin no lies, i’m used to you forgivin' and then you forget the truth
i promise that i’ll commit, vamoose to all my old ways
i’m done howlin' today, a full moon will never exist, i swear
