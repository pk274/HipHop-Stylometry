you look at my lifestyle
i'm living my life now
i'm dealing with diligent benjamin
how come my attitude piped down?
i'm fucking with ice now
i'm fucking with shit that you only can get
on an oversea flight now
you scared of my heights now
but still, i got enemies giving me energy
i wanna fight now
subliminal, sending me all of this hate
i thought i was holding the mic down
i thought i was holding my city up
i thought i was good in the media
you think i'm too hood in my video?
but really, no clue, you idiot
i just can't help myself
even when that record spin
every now and then, you hang yourself
'cause i got the green and gold (with a million sold)
plus plenty more, (and my dollar thicker)
but with or without the diamonds, though
(to you) i'm just another (nigga!)
