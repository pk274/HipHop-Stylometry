my nigga, do you have a gas can?
(the fuck i'm gonna do with a gas can, nah, nigga what?)
it's just been a long ass day, man
all i need is a gas can
(na, try down across the street, i think that nigga keep one, i don't know)
i'm finna head over there and i'mma be right back
(fuck what you doing, man?
knocking on the door extra hard and shit like you just stressed out or something)
my nigga, i don't even know where to begin, dog
(what happened, man?)


now it's 2:58 and i'm running late for work
running meanin' stuck in traffic cause the home depot is finna jerk
i been in the same position before
manager said it better be my last time, but it won't
i clocked in around 3:10 and i'm wishing i didn't
cause ups just brought in this big ass shipment
and for those that don't know, i work at a record store
and i make hot records (that's a sick ass gimmick)
finished the inventory then i logged on myspace
i had one download and 'bout 16 plays
5 friend requests from sucka mcs making a name
i signed out and had to question my aim (you weak nigga, that's all)
this old-timer walked in and we got to talking about eric b and rakim
and the perm on al sharpton
osama bin laden, obama in the office
and he looked me in my face and said i'm destined for fame
told him i do music, he like, "whatever you do, do it
and don't blink, the moment you close your eyes, you'll lose it"
word to wise, that was some great advice
that i took like i stole it, then my head sort of swollen
i guess that's why i shits on 'em like a cleansed colon
told the rest of the shoppers we finna be closing
i locked up like akon and hit the street
it's 8 pm, and i ain't had shit to eat
all day, kfc, snackers a dollar each
bar-b-que and nacho cheese
i bought 4, ate 3, gave one to top dawg
i would've had one for punch but he moved like a sloth
i'm back at the studio now if i lost ya
and everything's straight, you can thank great posture
hit my lil momma up cause i'm trying to cut
but she on the rag and i don't mean a bandanna
she told me come through, she gave me head like rihanna
and i deserve a standing ovation for my swagger
chuck the deuce, headed for the car to finish off the night right
but it wouldn't start


laugh it up nigga, laugh it up man
shit ain't funny man, that's why i need that damn gas can
(gas, nigga, you gotta put 5 dollars not 3 in)
shit nigga i ain't got 5 dollars to put in!
(that'll get you one gallon, nigga)
whatever man, bullshit dog, keep laughin'
(tryin' to save that extra dollar for that menu
for the mcdonalds menu nigga ain't gotta cut all the time
nigga you gotta put the whole 5 in it)
you gon' shoot me 5 or what? fuckin' bastard
(i know you're on a budget, but damn)
