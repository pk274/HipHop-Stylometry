you probably thinking i'm aggravated when i say i foresee the future
minus the white boy on final destination
they say it's one nation under god
but my reality, one person under a gun
and the funny thing
my paper chasing just begun
still premature and being the black entrepeneur
in this world where we lust for more money, cash and whores
got me defining life without my high school thesaurus
blink twice when you see my porsche headlights
my car is better than yours
i rub it in, like over-the-counter ointment
you're in desperation thinking that you can coexist
with the immortal vocalist, ford dealerships ain't this focussed
even when barefooted, the funky rhythm i still kick
dead presidents is the medicine for my evil heart
more franks than a ballpark, porcupine sharp
when i dress, when i talk, a dollar bill eject
my conversations about money, what you expect?


finna diminish any nigga tryna get involved
the fuck they be thinking? nothing at all
they go against, but still can't float against
no options, flows like a cheese pizza, no topping
big rig through both lanes, you play possum
you can't see me, flow cleaner than the water made by fiji
money clip like feed me, flyer than an airman straight from tuskegee
shoot you out the air man, bring your high down
the next morning your hungover from the sober sound
or the four pound, soviet unions in your town
what your homies doin?
theres some more bullets to go around, now
we can all get paper like xerox
or we can just reset tetris and clear blocks
or better yet sum us out the money and buy stock
or call will to the car dealer and buy the lots
getting paid period, every hour on the dot
