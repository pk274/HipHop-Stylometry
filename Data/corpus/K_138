i rather die on my mother fucking feet 'fore a nigga live on his knees
twin glocks in my palm back against the wall i'm ready for war
my enemies die slow when i ride screaming thug life pistol in the sky
remember me as a real nigga when i go
the hennessy got me riding dirty with my crew, nigga m-o-b
pussy ass niggas better duck they tails
niggas can hide when my squad bail nigga we ballin
aliz√© and weed keept on callin' gotta get some more
intoxicated got almost had me falling lemme hit the floor
world wide mob figures i bet you all of my niggas ready to die nigga
can you feel me? world wide mob figure
don't even wear yo strap if you ain't ready to die nigga
my attitude like fuck it middle finger towards the public
bringing buckets to all my adversaries and i love it
my momma stress every night telling me to slow down
i said "momma i'm in too deep ain't no turning back now"
cause the niggas from the other side they want me dead
catch me slipping roll up on me put a hole in my head
and the chronic just to got me even more paranoid
looking out the window if they coming i'm ready for 'em
just remember 2pacalypse never ran from 'em
ran to 'em eyes open with both guns dump'n
and till then tell them mother fuckers to strap up
guns blazing when they act up


so i move way different than i used to
eyes in back of my head everything bulletproof
walking out the house cautious
circle round the block twice before my car park it
my allies despise my success so they got me watching my every step
no exaggeration i know i can feel the reapers breath
hovering over me like a helicopter or a 747 on autopilot
all of my problems dissolve once i take control of my own destiny
hop on my murder chart overcome the odds
this goes out to all my dogs
just holler if you hear me like a charger made by dodge made by dodge
just ask pac what it's like to be ready every night
ak-47 by the window aiming at car lights
for makaveli the mac is ready to explode
on any mother fucker who curse his soul
death around the corner
