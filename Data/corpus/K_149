you better duck, run fast from the mania
don't stare, don't laugh at the media
brake free, press gas when it enter ya'
don't let it go bad when he ante up
highway, get out the way
black man do your great escape
pac-man wanna prosecute you
raise your hand up, and they'll shoot ya'
face off, face off adolf hitler
grandkids slayed off
niggas, same rules, same chalk
different decade, same law
keep focus, you wanna get caught with your eyes open
you wanna stay clear of the prognosis
pride provoked him, watch demotion
watch em' close enough
don't let the holster break or roast ya'
rollercoaster ride that bitch
soon or later sides gon' switch
you know johnny got that itch
how many more of us gotta see the coroner?
slain by the same badge, stop, wait, brake, fast!
