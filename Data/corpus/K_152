the life we have is no earthly thing
and i see the truth hidden in the lies between the covers
i see you and your heart broke heart in the chest
i see the end of a year in the making
another piece of bad news
i know you feel the way i do
you became my girlfriend last summer
i hope you know that it wasn't just a dream
and i feel the way you feel we feel today
i feel the way you feel we feel tomorrow
i feel a broken down house
i feel like a broken hollow
it's a brokenhearted man
it's a brokenhearted love
it's a brokenhearted song
and i feel the way you feel we feel today
i feel the way you feel we feel tomorrow
you've become my broken heart in the chest
we'd never leave her, never stop her from dying
i'll do anything if she'll hold you
i'm not going to let another day
i guess we'll forget, i guess we'll see
and she'll be high, but you know that i'm comin' home
i'll do anything, i don't know how, i don't think i can
i'll be your man, but i've got so much to do
oh, i'm never gonna let her go, no, no, no
you'll always be the one to blame
you'll always be the one to blame, yeah, you
but we make it happen anyway
the one to hurt me the most is you
you always say the things i wish you would do
you're always say the things i never said
and there's no knowing what's right
and what's right is wrong
when we all start to lose our grip
we can all start to bite each other
and if we know how it feels inside
it can be so hard sometimes
we're all in this together, peace, kendrick
