born with the best flow since ll was rockin' a kangol (woo)
'87, one man, eighty weapons
i go hard without usin' protection
hard out, learn your lesson
when i pull out, make like r. kelly, get to steppin', haha
i'm the best at this profession
i can't help but bring it back to the essence mothafuckas

i'm from a small city, no pity shown 'cept hammers thrown
quickly push back your dome like a hot comb
so swiftly, come get me
if i had every bitch in the world, boy, you still ain't fuckin' with me
i'm 'bout my money strictly, as long as i stack my banks up
i'll have enough young bucks to fuck with 50
now who fuckin' with me? me and that gun was born siamese twins
so where i move, it's comin' with me
you down right, play with me, think i won't take your life
the scope'll have more dots on you than a website
i'm 'bout my head right and yours left
i swear in the vocal booth is where i'll take my last breath
that's k-dot, oh you ain't heard? shit, that boy hot
with dime bitches runnin' on beaches like baywatch
you sit and watch the young child with my money stacks
add up faster than cell phones on speed dial
