ah, i parted ways with my old self, i'm a new man
new face with a new stone and the blue van
blew weight on a bad day with my loosie
suitcase full of merchandise, that's my new plan
this my new wave, this my new tan
this my summer days in the tropics by the cool sand
this my shakin' down you niggas' pockets, i don't do friends
and i don't do trends
fuck it though i'll ride with you then!
bring the troops in
i'll fuck around and let 'em loose then
we'll give 'em blues then
oh fuck it, call me bobby "blue" bland
aye you a fool man
ridin' by you, swervin' at the intersection
baby come and get your blessin'
and she gon' fuck with this erection
i got somethin' good for all these hoes
she gotta want the betty 'fore i call these hoes
now if i paid for your dress and your perm
that means you an investment, bitch
i'ma need my dough in return
