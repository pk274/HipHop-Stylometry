i don't need the hype
they call me- fuck it- i don't need no introduction
no ad-libing my name 100 times for nothing
you already know it's k. dot, city of compton
analogy is like biggie and bed stuy, oakland and 2pac
i'm more focused, i'm nothing like you new guys
struggling over a few lines thinking you hot
cause your homey said you you was a few times
which is too many times
they lying to you, they telling a lie
the only time i lie in the booth is when i sleep in it
record 24 hrs, you niggas better get your bars up
i bench press this rap stuff, got it locked like handcuffs
i threw away the key, my cool is on, she love my a/c
my juice is on, and i wish one of y'all try to rob me
i shoot, and have you laying between the sheets with the eyes leased (isleys)
i push the coupe like a high speed
the helicopters come and realize that nothing's behind me is behind me
your honor, i fuck over this beat with no condom
this ain't rap it's really a porno, re-wind me back
finally the finest of 'em all is back
to define the laws of crack, y'all don't obey
y'all ain't nice, y'all just ok
you're nothing more than a little john phrase
i'm mike jordan in his prime, modern day issac hayes
theme song to shaft, equivalent to the theme song to your career
study my craft, you ignorant, i do it without a pen and pad
just inspiration: something you never had
if my pockets is something you trying to grab
i pull out the rocket and peel you back like scab
you old news, you old dudes get out of my way
let the young boy come through; don't mention my age
i'm on a mission for pay, and you astronaut niggas just crowding my space
you not in my atmosphere, you can act like you here
but actually you ain't accurate fucking with the music biz
the industry like, "fuck it, let the music be his"
no theme park, i'm not trying to amuse you kids
small shark, jaws is here, jump in the water
do he really fuck with president carter?
my reply is that i can't stay away from the bosses
got the bidding war popping like an auction
5 or 10 labels like what he hitting for? 7 zeros or more?
remember having aftermath sitting on my door
money in front of me, couldn't open the door



i'm so far ahead of my time, i got people 5 years from now pressing rewind
i'm hardly a friend with y'all, i hate rappers, where is your artist at?
if it ain't a good picture you're draw, don't bring it to the architect
often you arguing 'bout who got next, claiming you're running the game
niggas are barely walking yet, hopping all over beats without studying training camp
try studying a few greats then maybe you'll be where i'm at
your songwriting ain't great, your mixtapes mediocre
you recycle the same quotes, you're not switching the flow
your flow in the same place, just don't rap; elaborate
try to expand, try to be more creative perhaps
my rap friends, i ain't saying you're wack, psyche
like an in-voice, i'm just stating the facts, right?
(?) metaphores i write, in fact, it's been a factor
you've feared your whole life, no tv show
don't compare me with them, that's like a shark versus nemo,  a gorilla to a chimp, jordan versus kukoƒç
a tony montana with blow on his nose to a nino
