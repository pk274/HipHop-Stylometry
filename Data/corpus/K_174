i remember, uhh
when my uncles
served smokers
on alondra
in front of our building, they was my heroes


this shit is so dope, you might wanna be my crack hoe
this shit is so dope, you might wanna be my crack hoe
bad bitches, crackheads, street niggas, crack hoes
this shit is so dope, you might wanna be my crack hoe


uhh, and that's scary to me
dope beat, dope flow, vary to me
especially when sounwave is on his p's
nigga cue me in i'm a peruvian drug lord
don't fast forward, i'ma serve you some keys
this is crack co-caine, i'm kurt co-bain
and i bang like a c-r-i-p
p-i-r-u, high you i'm a i-v
this shit is so dope, you might wanna be my crack— stop
i said a i-v cuz when i be in the studio, i shot
a needle in your veins, take it in vein
or itch till your eyeballs pop
i'm cold on the cold turkey
i hate chickens but i do fuck pretty birdies
where your girl at? over the pyrex, where my world at


this shit is so dope, you might wanna be my crack hoe
this shit is so dope, you might wanna be my crack hoe
bad bitches, crackheads, street niggas, crack hoes
this shit is so dope, you might wanna be my crack hoe


uhh, and it's scary to me
every listener is a strawberry to me
you pussies ain't shit but venereal disease
z's on k.dot? uh-uh better wake up
a nightmare, i'm right there like a siamese
-twin, when, you mothafuckas gon' learn?
curl up like big worm when i drop
who fly? i'm a red eye with eye drops
i big, i pac, you chris, i rock
that's pookie on new jack head first with a cyclops
i'm the first one to do that i bet you never knew that
back like a tailbone, who you got to tell on?
if ain’t about me about ho it be about face
if you ain’t on higher—learning
there's soda in the pot and the fire—burning


this shit is so dope, you might wanna be my crack hoe
this shit is so dope, you might wanna be my crack hoe
bad bitches, crackheads, street niggas, crack hoes
this shit is so dope, you might wanna be my crack hoe


uhh, and it's scary to carry
a smooth type flow like a drink of merlot
that'll freak y'all out like a girl virgo
when i turbo on any track, it's a reynold's wrap
and i rap like a nigga who invented rap
rapping heat, you can fall to defeat
if you don't pay ya tolls like the limbs on ya feet
i suppose this is bigger than life
this is probably everybody, illuminati
guess i'm the blood sacrifice of the party
i undress her like a harley
lights will flash, cars will crash
smoke more junk while the junkies laugh
so my bad if i put you in rehab
you are reimbursed, put it on my tab


this shit is so dope, you might wanna be my crack hoe
this shit is so dope, you might wanna be my crack hoe
bad bitches, crackheads, street niggas, crack hoes
this shit is so dope, you might wanna be my crack hoe
