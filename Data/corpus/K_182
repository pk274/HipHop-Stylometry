a nigga so goddamn stressed out
i feel like fuck everything right now
see i've been broke too long, can't find a job to save my life
but i'll be damned if i give 'em my handout
see my pride is one thing i will not put aside
i'm too proud to beg, i'm sorry left eye
if i don't make it in life, motherfucker i tried
what? uh


you ever feel like nobody never understands you but you?
not your momma, your poppa, only person is you
not your brother, your sister, the only person is you
you ever feel like nobody never understands you but you?
nobody, nobody but you
so it feels like, like it's only you


so i'm feeling like i want to, i want to
i want to, i want to go so far from here
very, very far from here
i need to, i need to
i need to, i need to go so far from here
very, very far from here


it seems like, you can't win for losing
whatever you're doing turns out to be "what-are-you-doing?"
sick of pursuing, that your time will soon come
nobody knows the position that you in
but it's a million people out there that's going through the same thing
that feeling, hard to explain
when you just, just want to get away
something like


you ever feel like nobody never understands you but you?
not your momma, your poppa, only person is you
not your brother, your sister, the only person is you
you ever feel like nobody never understands you but you?
nobody, nobody but you
so it feels like, like it's only you


so i'm feeling like i want to, i want to
i want to, i want to go so far from here
very, very far from here
i need to, i need to
i need to, i need to go so far from here
very, very far from here


so i'm feeling like i want to, i want to
i want to, i want to go so far from here
very, very far from here
i need to, i need to
i need to, i need to go so far from here
very, very far from here
