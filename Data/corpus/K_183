annie, are you okay? ooh, yeah (ooh, la-la)
annie, are you okay? ooh, yeah
do you like foreplay? ooh, yeah
do you go both ways? i really need confirmation
your love is abomination, fucking you is like a bomb of nations
area 51 in that pussy, ah
the president 'bout to cum in that pussy, ah
i got mind control, i got dick control
i reel 'em in for the fishing pole
i love legs like robyn fenty
stretch them shits like limo bentleys
catch them tits with an open mouth
the interview up outta that oprah house
you know i love it when it's pokin' out
you know i'm thuggin' even in the drought, you know him
i fuck around and crash a brand new bugatti
in the mothafuckin' lobby so you know i'm in the building
won't you kiss it, baby? take a picture
i, i, i, i, i'm killin' em
illuminati want my money and my body
even donny rollin' by me, looking aggravated that i made it
fuck you and your mama, nigga
i, i, i, i, i see the bitch in them, i got the benjamin
i got the dividend, i'm on my toes like serena at the wimbledon
pie Ã  la mode on a monday for my woman-friend
i'm in the mode of a mortal man
i'm living in the orbit of deliverin'
sex in a cathedral, empty, grand marnier that i reload, ten gs
in the hallway, she a leo, i'm a gemini
give me mine, genocide, kill 'em all, thirty times
