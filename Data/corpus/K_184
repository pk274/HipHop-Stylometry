pussy and patrón, that's some great advice

welcome to my diary, stressing got me gray hairs
something to inspire me, rather than society's
woes, let me go, let me shine a lil' bit, love
i want diamonds, too: ronnie on player's club
i used to have a nine-to-five; fresh out of school—that was '05
that bitch was racist, got me fired; ever since then, i had no job
pushing in my momma van, stop for gas on rosecrans
trust me, these niggas rushed me for something my cousin prolly did
guilty by association: story of my life, nigga
you gon' make me flip and split your shit, judge give me life, nigga
pain since my grandma's death, uncle killed at louie's burgers
hold my tears, i tried my best; let it go, drench my pullover
cycles of a starving artist, tryna go beyond the margin— margin
maintaining my modest— modest as i dream
so while i go through all this— all this bullshit, what you call it
life itself, i know what helps, let me scroll through my blackberry
("hey, what's up, daddy?")


i'm going through something with life
but pussy and patrón make you feel alright
pussy and patrón make you feel alright
pussy and patrón, that's some great advice
i'm going through something with life
but pussy and patrón make you feel alright
pussy and patrón make you feel alright
pussy and patrón, that's some great advice

all i need in this lifetime: pussy and patrón
give me that, once you give me that, once again, it's on
bitch, i'm swagged up, hoes bopping when i'm off that screw
coming down clean, tell your baby momma, "what it do?"
where your friends at? i got long dick—what it is?
go'n' poke it out, situate your little positives
how i live? big shot, on my grind, already
i'ma lay it down like a carpenter when you let me


ugh, i wrote this song when dave drove home
and caught that flat in the mean t-flats
and it made me think if we could blink
to change locations where we at
we often get lost in the alcohol bottle
in attempt to ignore pain, problem, and sorrow
just for a minute, then back to the bullshit
your car note due, and you 'bout to get evicted
two drugs, surely, patrón, pussy, make it feel alright
but once it's empty and that bitch leave, then it's back to life
you can't run from it, gotta run to it, nigga
the antidote wouldn't last, and you knew it, nigga
but still, you proceed to dive deep, ask what's her zodiac sign


i'm going through something with life
but pussy and patrón make you feel alright
pussy and patrón make you feel alright
pussy and patrón, that's some great advice
i'm going through something with life
but pussy and patrón make you feel alright
pussy and patrón make you feel alright
pussy and patrón, that's some great advice


i'm going through something in life
but pussy and patrón make you feel alright

pussy and patrón, that's some great advice
i'm going through something in life
but pussy and patrón make you feel alright
