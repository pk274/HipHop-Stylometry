welcome to my diary, stressing got me gray hairs
something to inspire me, rather than society's
woes, let me go, let me shine a lil' bit love
i want diamonds too, ronnie on player's club
i used to have a 9 to 5, fresh out of school that was '05
that bitch was racist, got me fired, ever since then i had no job
pushing in my mama van, stop for gas on rosecrans
trust me these niggas rushed me for something my cousin probably did
guilty by association story of my life, nigga
you gone make me flip then split your shit, judge give me life, nigga
pain since my grandma's death, uncle killed at louis's burgers
hold my tears i tried my best, let it go drench my pullover
cycles of a starving artist tryna go beyond the margin's margin
maintaining my modest, modest as i dream
so while i go through all this, all this bullshit what you call it
life itself i know it helps let me scroll through my blackberry


hey, whats up, daddy?
i'm going through something with life

i said keep reading my diary, when my life's entirely
surrounded by the irony of living in the city
i said they wouldn't hire me, i said i got my ass beat
and the only thing can help is ass and some titties
so what's up, baby? i said what's up?
i had a long day and i really wanna fuck
see i ain't tryna think about no phone bills
credit card late fees, capital one popping up on my caller id
pawning my chain in the shop, watching for hollow-tip shots
watching my vehicle break down on another man's block
man that's my worst fear, ain't that your worst fear
you know when your transmission go out and can't switch gears
or run through a pothole at two in the morning
scared to hit your emergencies cause then they'll be on it
see i know when the harsh reality take its toll
open up your contacts then scroll
