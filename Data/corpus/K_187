i used to want to see the penitentiary way after elementary
thought it was cool to look the judge in the face when he sentenced me
since my uncles was institutionalized
my intuition had said i was suited for family ties
my mama is stressin', my daddy tired
i need me a weapon, these niggas ride
every minute, hour, and second, ministers tried to save me
how i'm gon' listen when i don't even hear god?
heaven or hell, base it all on my instincts

the same nigga that kill with you'll squeal with you
i deal with you like my son, stare at the sun
and you'll be looking in my eyes, homie

not rich, but wealthy, there's nothing you can tell me
my killings are not remorseful
the city got my back, and for that, i give them my torso
you think about it and don't call me lyrical
'cause really i'm just a nigga that's evil and spiritual
i know some rappers using big words to make they similes curve
my simplest shit be more pivotal
i penetrate the hearts of good kids and criminals
worrisome individuals that live life critical
so won't you bear witness while i bare feet?
so you can walk in my shoes and get to know me
but anyway, this for my pops
on his lunch break eating in that parking lot
on "wanna be heard," probably thought he worked my nerves
but really he was stressing me gettin' what i deserve
somebody said my name on the radio
he ain't know i was ready for the world that minute
so the next time he roll up and drop grams in it
he probably be out of work, laid back, while he
