rolling down rosecrans bumping d-a-z
feeling like 1-9-9-3 '91 to the seventh jam
i'm in long beach, home of dillagent, dilligent gangsta shit
gangsters killing, you wanksters quit filling your ipod's up with classics
ainâ€™t a nigga out can out-match them adlibs
dpgc general
jay know my breath marching, hold all my genitals
yeah, it's like that cause i was taught that
back when dog food dropped in the compton swap meet parking lot
daddy rehab three, so going to my pops we was popping now
the trunk in the caddy was rocking now
slap a nigga in the face with a little waist, even make 'pac salute
snare like a bear trap, they're imperible too
bear witness
kids like barry bonds, that's the realest, nigga
