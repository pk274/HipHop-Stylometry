this dick ain't free
you lookin' at me like it ain't a receipt
like i never made ends meet
eating your leftovers and raw meat
this dick ain't free
livin' in captivity raised my cap salary
celery, tellin' me green is all i need
evidently, all i seen was spam and raw sardines
this dick ain't free, i mean, baby
you really think we could make a baby named mercedes
without a mercedes benz and twenty-four-inch rims
five percent tint, and air conditioning vents?
hell fuckin' naw, this dick ain't free
i need forty acres and a mule
not a forty ounce and a pitbull
bullshit, matador, matador
had the door knockin', let 'em in, who's that?
genital's best friend, this dick ain't free
pity the fool that made the pretty in you prosper
titty juice and pussy lips kept me obnoxious
kept me up watchin' pornos in poverty; apology? no
watch you politic with people less fortunate, like myself
every dog has its day, now doggy style shall help
this dick ain't free
matter of fact, it need interest
matter of fact, it's nine inches
matter of fact, see our friendship based on business
pension, more pension, you're pinchin' my percents
it's been relentless, fuck forgiveness, fuck your feelings
fuck your sources, all distortion, if you fuck it's more abortion
more divorce courts and portion
my check with less endorsement left me dormant
dusted, doomed, disgusted, forced with
fuck you think is in more shit?
porcelain pipes pressure, bust 'em twice
choice is devastated, decapitated the horseman
oh america, you bad bitch, i picked cotton and made you rich
now my dick ain't free
