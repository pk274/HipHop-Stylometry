now, baby, when i get you, get you, get you, get you
i'ma go hit the throttle with you
smoking, lokin', poking that doja 'til i'm idle with you
'cause i (want you)
now, baby, when i'm riding here, i'm riding dirty
registration is out of service
smoking, lokin', drinking that potion, you can see me swerving
'cause i (want you)
(i want you more than you know)

i remember you took me to the mall last week, baby
you looked me in my eyes about four, five times
'til i was hypnotized, then you clarified
that i (want you)
you said sherane ain't got nothing on lucy
i said, "you crazy?"
roses are red, violets are blue
but me and you both pushing up daisies if i (want you)


now, baby, when i get you, get you, get you, get you
i'ma go hit the throttle with you
smoking, lokin', poking that doja 'til i'm idle with you
'cause i (want you)

you said to me, you said your name was lucy
i said, "where's ricardo?"
you said, "oh, no, not the show"
then you spit a little rap to me like this
when i turned twenty-six, i was like, "oh, shit"
you said to me, i remember what you said too, you said:
"my name is lucy, kendrick, you introduced me, kendrick
usually i don’t do this but i see you and me, kendrick
lucy give you no worries, lucy got million stories
about these rappers that i came after when they was boring
lucy gon' fill your pockets
lucy gon' move your mama out of compton
inside the gi-gantic mansion like i promised
lucy just want your trust and loyalty, avoiding me?
it's not so easy, i'm at these functions accordingly
kendrick, lucy don't slack a minute, lucy work harder
lucy gon' call you even when lucy know you love your father
i'm lucy, i loosely heard prayers on your first album, truly
lucy don't mind, 'cause at the end of the day you'll pursue me
lucy go get it, lucy not timid, lucy up front
lucy got paperwork on top of paperwork
i want you to know that lucy got you
all your life i watched you
and now you all grown up to sign this contract, if that’s possible"


get you, get you, get you, get you
i'ma go hit the throttle with you
smoking, lokin', poking that doja 'til i'm idle with you
'cause i (want you)
now, baby, when i'm riding here, i'm riding dirty
registration is out of service
smoking, lokin', drinking that potion, you can see me swerving
'cause i (want you)
