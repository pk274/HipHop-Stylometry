everybody wanna be great, but the work don't relate him to life
be mistakin' the truth, nigga
i remember bankin' with chase, like four-hundred k
starin' at it, i ain't know what to do, nigga
now i look at money like a resource
every contract gotta put my kid's family in school
health and wealth, goin' deep for it, do right for my next life
let me get some too
i remember roaches, mama lost focus
i was at home, no lights, no food
heard that the joke is "hykeem broke"
and head to the ground when i walk in school
goin' through the motions, mad impulsive
granny, i won't abide by the rules
i shall reside with advisers to boom
fuck that, booman, let me get some too
life ain't always about your name in they mouth
and the cars and the clothes and the jewels (jewels, oh)
every lil' bitch that's born looking like soft porn
only meant for your ego to bruise (bruise, oh)
bet when the hoes get bored and the points ain't score
you gon' live in this world confused ('fused, woah)
every day, the hate restored and the faith get short
fuck that, let me get some too
nigga, my livelihood was understood
that the roof i'm in not bool
nigga, the shoes i fill are huge
"keem, wanna share that ho?" bro, move
nigga wanna fake sneak diss
'cause i fucked his bitch in a black hatchback
i front in the pics when the heart don't match
take care of the kids, gotta go where they at, ayy


hold on, let's get this shit, let's get this shit

ain't shit changed, still fuckin' and rappin'
two bad bitches here, cartier glasses, huh
her friend got pornography habits ("give me that bitch!" "but, sir!")
rollie gang, rollie gang, rollie gang (pglang, fool)
hundred thousand on her, she know she gang (she's hot)
rover gang, rover gang, rover gang (rover gang)
range brothers out the roof, we're not the wayans (we're not the wayans)
bitch, i hate to tell the truth, we're not the same (he's baby keem)
i'm with my rover brother and we're runnin' game (a range rover)
whippin' rubber bands on the meatloaf
overseas, tidy up for me 'fore i get home
take one, take two, take three, heave it
stop hidin' comments under your sleeve, nigga, believe it
why your boyfriend keep on lookin' for me, is he jesus?


let's get this shit, let's get this shit
