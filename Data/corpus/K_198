tell me that i'm famous
tell me that my name is
big as venus jupiter and then uranus
tell me that your anus got your head in it
i can smell the articles and know you're heinous
tell me that you love me, always thinkin' of me
unconditional, i'm hoping i'm your favourite
grab a fishing pole and throw me with the sharks
that's the feelin' i get when you're concentratin'
on this pen, on this pad
tell me you're willin' to diss on my craft
tell me the feelin' of pickin' apart this track
stop...
puttin' my heart and my soul in these lines
tellin' me platinum and gold all the time
lookin' to bury, a deep hole for mine
drop...
this is more than you, and this is more than you
and your entire building slanderin' and abusin'
what i call the realest comin' from a student
told myself to use a poem as an uzi
empty magazine, i seen a magazine
you seen my trigger finger, then i started shootin'
that was nicotine, i'm bout to smoke 'em all
and journalists involved should've known my music
