formation, formation
exclamation, formation
fellow great americans, hello
this is heritage for my medicine
ten hail marys, i meditate for practice
channel 9 news tell me i'm movin' backwards
eight blocks left, death is around the corner
seven misleadin' statements 'bout my persona
six headlights aimin' in my direction
five-o askin' me what's in my possession
yeah, i keep runnin', jump in the aqueducts
fire marshalls and hazardous
smoke alarms on the back of us
but mama, don't cry for me, ride for me
try for me, live for me
breathe for me, sing for me
obviously guidin' me
i could be more than i gotta be
stole from me, lied to me, nation hypocrisy
code on me, drive on me
wicked, my spirit inspired me
like yeah, open correctional gates in higher desert
yeah, open our mind as we cast away oppression
yeah, open the streets and watch our beliefs
and when they carve my name inside the concrete
i pray it forever reads


what you want from me?
is it truth you seek? oh father can you hear me?
