we outlawed, then i bogart, any pros that got 'proached at
with a toe-tag, get broke off in the projects with a skateboard
i roll past and i blaze y'all like, "doo, doo," i hate y'all
when the beef cooked, i ate y'all like, "mmm, mmm!"
let's play ball in a ballpark with all sharks and a blindfold
i rhyme cold, my k hot, your 9 cold, that bark like k9s on
that banana clip, straight from the rip
i'll make that shirt say r.i.p., i'm on some shit
if i'm not the hottest then hell must have froze over
you thought it was safe then forgot what the code was
i carry traits of a traumatized soldier
don't look in my face, i might snap, i might choke ya
spine right out of place, give me dap like you 'posed to
darts at your posters, dark nights like this
i metamorph like i'm 'posed to, i might slice my wrist
or pretend like a vulture and drop off this cliff
