ten hail marys, i meditate for practice
channel 9 news tell me i'm movin' backwards
eight blocks left, death is around the corner
seven misleadin' statements 'bout my persona
six headlights wavin' in my direction (come on)
five-o askin' me what's in my possession
yeah, i keep runnin', jump in the aqueducts
fire hydrants and hazardous
smoke alarms on the back of us
but mama, don't cry for me, ride for me
try for me, live for me
breathe for me, sing for me
honestly guidin' me
i could be more than i gotta be
stole from me, lied to me, nation hypocrisy
code on me, drive on me
wicked, my spirit inspired me, like yeah
open correctional gates in higher desert (yeah)
open our mind as we cast away oppression (yeah)
open the streets and watch our beliefs
and when they carve my name inside the concrete
i pray it forever reads


what you want from me?
is it truth you seek? oh, father, can you hear me?
what you want from me?
is it truth you seek? oh, father, can you hear me?
hear me out
