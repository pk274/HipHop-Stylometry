what's your life about? enlighten me
is you gon' live on your knees or die on your feet?
it's fire in the street, fire in my swisher
fire in between the two legs of your lil' sister
just get a sip of this elixir
before they crop us out the picture
i've never seen a crop circle
but i seen cops circle the block
i puff squares, but i swear, one day, i'ma stop
my nerves itch
on the brink of my career
while my peers struggle for employment
can you hear these screams?
(uncle sam ain't no kin to me)
one, two, three, four grams and a fifth of hennessy
a bad bitch, fuck the penitentiary
section 80s babies, blame ronald reagan
we raising hell, hell (oh)
lord forbid, the homies got wet, so we trying to soak it in
the president is black, but you can't vote for skin
you vote for the better man
come to our show, you could see the diversity
unify the people, they gon' peep it universally
we might not change the world
but we gon' manipulate it, i hope you participatin'
ayo, dot, won't you let these cats know?
we knew we'd be here, like, back in '04
started hiiipower because our generation needed a generator
in a system meant to disintegrate us (ooh)
and all we do is assist them
we're not victors, we're victims
the bigger picture isn't developed yet
like, what if keisha was celibate?
or what if tammy came across a real man
who didn't play games like children?
my nigga cheated on his girlfriend
with his girlfriend's girlfriend, let the world end
and everybody tripping off 2012
and the extraterrestrial presence as well
(odd future's aight) but our future is not
that martial law shit drop, we gon' all get got
so keep that question mark on your face
eat your fast food, use your fluoride toothpaste
hide your feelings from the public, work your lil' nine to five
don't forget to pay your tithes and thank god you're alive
hiiipower
and on another note
we focused like the hubble telescope
soul


life is a traffic jam, life is a traffic jam
(life is a traffic jam)
life is a traffic jam, life is a traffic jam
life is a traffic jam, life is a traffic jam
(i'm ready to go, ready to go)
life is a traffic jam, life is a traffic jam
(ready to go, ready to go)
life is a traffic jam
life...


i wrote this because i was ordered to
people say i speak for generation y
why lie? i do, section.80
your son'll play me if radio won't
daughters that just turn one 'til twenty-one listen to kendrick
for instance
what's your life about? enlighten me
is you gon' live on your knees or die on your feet?
take out that student loan, and pay off your college degree
and do exactly what you see on tv
true story
hmm
can you repeat that for me, soul?
what's your life about? enlighten me
is you gon' live on your knees or die on your feet?
is you gon' plead the fifth or sound the horn?
the time is now, my child, come on
see, a lot of y'all don't understand kendrick lamar
because you wonder how i could talk about money, hoes, clothes, god, and history all in the same sentence
you know what all them things have in common?
only half of the truth, if you tell it
see i spent twenty-three years on this earth searching for answers
'til one day i realized i had to come up with my own
i'm not on the outside looking in
i'm not on the inside looking out
i'm in the dead fucking center, looking around
you ever seen a newborn baby kill a grown man?
that's an analogy for the way the world make me react
my innocence been dead
so, the next time i talk about money, hoes, clothes, god, and history all in the same sentence
just know i meant it, and you felt it
'cause you too are searching for answers
i'm not the next pop star, i'm not the next socially-aware rapper
i am a human motherfuckin' being over dope-ass instrumentation
kendrick lamar
now fuck 'em up, terrace
(soul)


i watch this fire that we’re gathered around
and see that it burns similar to the fire that’s inside you
section.80
section.80 babies
a generation of bliss and disobedience
no, they can't control us
no, they can't control you
no, they can't control us
but we can control each other
we build our own world
if you don't leave with nothing else tonight
you will leave with knowing yourself
you will leave knowing that you represent something that's bigger than all of us
our family
heart, honor, and respect
this is you
this is me
and we are hiiipower

uh-uh, fuck that


eight doobies to the face, fuck that
twelve bottles in the case, nigga, fuck that
two pills and a half-weight, nigga, fuck that
got a high tolerance when your age don't exist


man, i swear my nigga trippin' off that shit again
pick him up, then i set him in cold water
then i order someone to bring him vicodin
hope that take the pain away
from the feelin' that he feel today
you know when you part of section.80
you feel like no one can relate
'cause you are, you are, a loner, loner
marijuana endorphins make you stronger, stronger
i'm in the house party trippin' off
my generation sippin' cough syrup like it's water
never no pancakes in the kitchen
man, not one of our lives is caught up
in the daily superstition that the world is 'bout to end
who gives a fuck? we never do listen
'less it comes with an 808 (a melody and some hoes)
playstation and some drank (technology bought my soul)
lookin' around and all i see is a big crowd that's product of me
and they probably relatives relevant for a rebel's dream
yep, her president is black, she black too
purple label on her back, but that tab is light blue
she take it straight to the head, then she look at me
she got adhd


eight doobies to the face, fuck that
twelve bottles in the case, nigga, fuck that
two pills and a half-weight, nigga, fuck that
got a high tolerance when your age don't exist


like woah-woah, woah, woah-woah, woah (don't got a limit, just give me some more with it)
woah-woah, woah, woah-woah, woah (don't got a limit, just give me some more with it)
(they always told me adhd did it)
woah, woah-woah


and then she started
and then she started feelin' herself like no one else in this apartment
"beg your pardon? oh, i rap, baby, how old are you?"
she say twenty-two, i say twenty-three, "okay, then we are crack babies," damn
"why you say that?" she said, "where my drink at?"
"i'ma tell you later, just tell your neighbors and the police relax"
i stood up, shut the blind, closed the screen, jumbotron
made to the back where she reside, then she said, "read between the lines," yep
hope that i get close enough when the lights turn down
and the fact that she just might open up when the nuvo start to drown
her body, and i know the both of us really deep in the mood now
it's nothin' we can do now, somebody walked in with a pound (woah)
of that bay area kush, she looked at me, then looked
at it, then she grabbed it, then she said, "get it understood"
"you know why we crack babies? because we born in the '80s
the adhd crazy"


eight doobies to the face, fuck that
twelve bottles in the case, nigga, fuck that
two pills and a half-weight, nigga, fuck that
got a high tolerance when your age don't exist


like woah-woah, woah, woah-woah, woah (don't got a limit, just give me some more with it)
woah-woah, woah, woah-woah, woah (don't got a limit, just give me some more with it)
(they always told me adhd did it)
woah, woah-woah

ali, mix it
ha ha ha, lady g, whaddup?
ha ha ha, bad love, whaddup?
ha ha ha, ha...


i spaz out 'til i pass out
there’s clarity in my vulgarity for a sass-mouth
your parody’s not funny
apparently you ain't nothing but industry crash dummies
as long as the lord love me, i’m good
i could: be the best rapper but i’d rather be the answer that capture the violence that coincides in my hood
i should: stick a fork in this music business
but i’m too deep in it like pussy on my penis
devil’s kitchen in phoenix; that’s the heat that i’m bringing where the shade at?
i’m l.a. radio and good music, boy, i don’t play that
ugh, walking a thin line from thinking like einstein
and rhyming like rakim in ’89
don’t wanna pack a nine just a mind full of wisdom
like a man 99 years old locked in prison
don’t freeload on my vision
get exposed like an r&b ho with a sex tape hidden
i’m always for the business, forever you can feel it
whether you crip blue or a nigga that hemorrhage
my penmanship is like me and langston combined to the hip
and my hip to the hop don’t stop as i rock
i got a buzz like a shot of palmer sun
and the women fall in love as they fall in my crotch
now understand that i’m all that you’ve got
give me chance, give me ears, give me hearts, give me props
hear the difference? i’m cool like that
oh, you spit? well the retarded drool is back
see, i’m the author of the authors, the father of the austin power fajja
who can bust like a charter, why bother?
i know a jealous serpent is a burden to my life
but still i carry on like luggage on a flight
the realness in my bones is the dna to life
i can give you insight only if you’re in sight
i’m looking past y’all like a fastball - strike!
and i ain't even tryna give it my all - yikes!
i’m comfortable enough to go and chill out with a huxtable
you couldn’t see my pedestal, because you’re afraid of heights
cloud 9, where you can find
me in my dime like roosevelt in his prime
wait 'til i’m in my prime
the moon and the stars will align on my louis v. belt like orion
to whom say he cool: but the irony is i could hold the bottom of an iron with the bottom of my palm
i say so much, so little all action, no talk like a mime throwing up gang signs
it’s not all about punchlines, i don’t do that
i’m a jaguar; you’re just a new cat, now move back
kendrick lamar on the radar for success
aiming for the top like an ar aimed at your neck
i can never digress, ‘less i get demoted to death
even then i’ll be the best still, like a petty theft
i will: conquer my biggest dreams
once you open the cage, i bet that i’ll spread my wings
nipsy got street cred, jay rock got street cred
and all i got is bad credit, big ears and big head
but still they’ll feel me, cause we all ate cereal
humped our momma's friend's daughter while they bump the stereo
backflips on shopping carts, free lunch at the park
watched power rangers after school; here we go
i’m so comptonized, i will never compromise
for no faulty ass a&r or ceo
we ain't what you think and you think we’re back
but we’ve been here for decades, and i vouch for that
open your mouth for that, speak well like a great debater over ichat
get your other eye cracked
i don’t rap, i-iraq and declare war
i enjoy watching enemies' blood pour
i came up lower middle class, not poor
so don’t feel sorry for me, i don’t need y’all to love me
i need y’all to feel me
and if you feeling froggy to leap, then feel free
my feeling’s all aside, my pride is deprived
by the ultimate prize i'mma get when i see your suicide

hallelujah, k. dot'll do ya
quicker than a porno star, jump on my dick y'all
and get fucked by the millisecond
duck when i pull the weapon from out of my mouth (buh!)
shots at you like a sawed-off
aiming for your grill like i'm paul wall
then peal 'til i not y'all
my cerebral cortex is like a war vet
sharing war stories with the deceased, i'm brain dead
straight bananas, i never gave a fuck
'bout anything but my momma, my daddy, siblings, and grandma
and if you neither one of them, then i gotta answer
every question with a bullet hole in my hammer
like vh1, that's far beyond your comprehension
like a deaf person showing up to court for a hearing
who they fearing? k. dot
tickle the nipples of women
make your bitch grab her crotch when she hear my shit, bitch!


k. dot got the unorthodox flow
on fire, make a rapper burn his soul
murder for hire, acquire choirs for funerals
numero uno, city in my rearview
compton on my back like the titties of my masseuse
pity, here you fool who?
go against me, i rebuke thee
and wake thee up, six in the morning
with the pump, punks jump up to get beat down
jump shot, coroners catch them on the rebound
pans, pots, plates, bowls
i'm in your kitchen eating your stove
i'm hungry and hibernated
i'm cold as miles davis
i load up then i aim it
no judgment for the plaintiff
it only gets more heinous, nigga i'm brainless
like a blind bitch who don't suck dick
dinosaur manure, big shit
smell me or die quick, fucka!
(fuck a hook)
(jab, jab, jab, left right)
(fuck a hook)
(damnit, genius)


i can stand in a pool of gasoline lighting a blunt and never catch on fire
(how come?) silly motherfucker, i'm fire
smack the devil over the cheek, gave him a third degree burn
iced it down when he was asleep, and said you'll be okay
a lot of rappers are desperate to be a star by the day
they hydroplaning, hoping that they get their big break
i'm just saying, i feel i'm the one
like a magician with a stick inside his hand, or the name of a mexican
i gets ignorant with ya
snap me a picture, bitch, i'm famous
i came in this world nuts in my palm and drinking paul masson
in a stolen cavalier like i took lebron
locked him in a basement and amputated his shooting arm
(psss) now that's a stretch ab-soul
like a fifty mile strip when i'm pimping these hoes
call me dolomite, nope i take that back
found out he gay as a happy day or the way that you rap
(ee)

(k. dot got the unorthodox flow
on fire, make a rapper burn his soul
murder for hire, acquire choirs for funerals)
(look, ee)
(damnit)

now, i don't give a fuck if you
black, white, asian, hispanic, goddammit
that don't mean shit to me
fuck your ethnicity, nigga


fire burning inside my eyes, this the music that saved my life
y'all be calling it hip-hop, i be calling it hypnotize
yeah, hypnotize, trapped my body, but freed my mind
what the fuck are you fighting for? ain't nobody gon' win that war
my details be retail, man, i got so much in store
racism is still alive, yellow tape and colored lines
fuck that, nigga, look at that line, it's so diverse
they gettin' off work and they wanna see kendrick
everybody can't drive benzes, and i been there, so i make it my business
to give 'em my full attention, ten-hut, man, i gotta get my wind up
man, i gotta get down with god 'cause i got my sins up, ooh
matter fact, don't mistake me for no fuckin' rapper
they sit backstage and hide behind them fuckin' cameras
i mosh pit, had a microphone and i tossed it
had a brain, then i lost it
i'm out of my mind, so don't you mind how much the cost is
penny for my thoughts, everybody, please hold up your wallets
yeah, man, i'm the mailman, can't you tell, man?
gone postal, never freeze up when i approach you
that's starstruck and roast you, oh my
hiiipower


reporting live from planet terminator x
i saw martin luther king with an ak-47


now, i don't give a fuck if you
black, white, asian, hispanic, goddammit
that don't mean shit to me
fuck your ethnicity, nigga


i'm tired of y'all, 'cause everybody lied to y'all
and you believe it? recognize them false achievements
it's treason and i'm tylenol, i knock out when you knock it off
knock on the doors of opportunity, i'm too involved
i'm no activist, i'm no einstein
before calculus, i was kicking that math
dropping that science like an alchemist and i be kicking that ass
lyrically, i'm ufc
if a ufo had came for me, i'ma come back with the head of an alien
don't alienate my dreams
get it right, get a life, i got two
that's a metaphor for the big shit i do
boy, tmi, tsa, man, i'm fly
put wings on my back
that a plane or an angel? both
like a pilot with a halo, woah
gross


i mean, i've seen so many things come through them, him, her, you, mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm
i'm just a messenger

the sky is falling, the wind is calling
stand for something or die in the morning
section.80, hiiipower


visions of martin luther staring at me
malcolm x put a hex on my future, someone catch me
i'm falling victim to a revolutionary song, the serengeti's clone
back to put you backstabbers back on your spinal bone
you slipped your disc when i slid you my disc
you wanted to diss, but jumped on my dick
grown men never should bite their tongue
unless you eatin' pussy that smell like it's a stale plum
i got my finger on the motherfuckin' pistol
aimin' it at a pig, charlotte's web is gonna miss you
my issue isn't televised and you ain't gotta tell the wise
how to stay on beat, because our life's an instrumental
this is physical and mental, i won't sugarcoat it
you'd die from diabetes if these other niggas wrote it
and everything on tv just a figment of imagination
i don't want a plastic nation, dread that like a haitian
while you motherfuckers waiting, i be off the slave ship
building pyramids, writing my own hieroglyphs


just call the shit hiiipower
nigga, nothing less than hiiipower
five-star dishes, food for thought, bitches
i mean this shit is
huey newton going stupid, you can't resist his
hiiipower
throw your hands up for hiiipower


visions of martin luther staring at me
if i see it how he seen it, that would make my parents happy
sorry, mama, i can't turn the other cheek
they wanna knock me off the edge like a fuckin' widow's peak, uh
and she always told me pray for the weak, uh
them demons got me, i ain't prayed in some weeks, uh
dear lord, come save me, the devil's working hard
he probably clockin' double shifts on all of his jobs
frightenin', so fuckin' frightenin'
enough to drive a man insane, i need a license to kill
i'm standing on a field full of land mines
doin' the moonwalk, hopin' i blow up in time
'cause 2012 might not be a fuckin' legend
tryna be a fuckin' legend, the man of mankind
who said a black man in the illuminati?
last time i checked, that was the biggest racist party
so get up off that slave ship
build your own pyramids, write your own hieroglyphs


just call the shit hiiipower
nigga, nothing less than hiiipower
five-star dishes, food for thought, bitches
i mean this shit is
bobby seale makin' meals, you can't resist his
hiiipower

every day, we fight the system just to make our way
we been down for too long, but that's alright
we was built to be strong, 'cause it's our life, na-na-na
every day, we fight the system, we fight the system
we fight the system (never like the system)
we been down for too long, but that's alright, na-na-na


who said a black man in the illuminati?
last time i checked, that was the biggest racist party
last time i checked, we was racin' with marcus garvey
on the freeway to africa 'til i wreck my audi
and i want everybody to view my autopsy
so you can see exactly where the government had shot me
no conspiracy, my fate is inevitable
they play musical chairs once i'm on that pedestal
frightenin', so fuckin' frightenin'
enough to drive a man insane, a woman insane
the reason lauryn hill don't sing, or kurt cobain
loaded that clip and then said bang
the drama it bring is crazy, product of the late '80s
tryna stay above water, that's why we shun the navy
pull your guns and play me, let's set it off

thug life
thug life


i wrote this record while thirty thousand feet in the air
stewardess complimenting me on my nappy hair
if i can fuck her in front of all of these passengers
they'll probably think i'm a terrorist, eat my asparagus
then i'm asking her thoughts of a young nigga
fast money and freedom, a crash dummy for dollars
i know you dying to meet him, i'll probably die in a minute
just bury me with twenty bitches, twenty million, and a comptown fitted


hol' up (hol' up), hol' up (hol' up)
hol' up (hol' up), hol' up (hol' up)
yeah, big shit poppin'
section.80


back in this bitch, in the back of that bitch
with my back against the wall and your bitch on the edge of my dick, jump off
i call a bitch a bitch, a ho a ho, a woman a woman
i never did nothing but break the ground on top of the asphalt
tire mark gave you evidence that i'm easily peddlin'
with the speed of a lightning bolt
as a kid, i killed two adults, i'm too advanced
i lived my twenties at two years old, the wiser man
truth be told, i'm like eighty-seven
wicked as eighty reverends in a pool of fire with devils holding hands
from a distance, don't know which one is a christian, damn
who can i trust in 2012? there's no one, not even myself
a gemini screaming for help, somebody


hol' up (hol' up), hol' up (hol' up)
hol' up (hol' up), hol' up (hol' up)
yeah, big shit poppin', everybody watchin'
when you do it like this, nigga, losing ain't a option
hol' up (hol' up), hol' up (hol' up)
hol' up (hol' up), hol' up (hol' up)
yeah, big shit poppin'
ayy, ayy, kick her out the studio, ali


24/7, nigga working his ass for it, she poppin' that ass for
the king of diamonds with diamonds, i never do ask for it
they checkin' my passport, i'm too accustomed with customs
you callin' the task force, i killed it, somebody cuff him
they want me to fast forward the game, and
why you complain when you niggas is past poor?
you'll never hop in my lane when you pushing a rav4
you wrecking my jaguar
you play like a bad sport
her feet on the dashboard


hol' up (hol' up), hol' up (hol' up)
hol' up (hol' up), hol' up (hol' up)
yeah, big shit poppin', everybody watchin'
when you do it like this, nigga, losing ain't an option
hol' up (hol' up), hol' up (hol' up)
hol' up (hol' up), hol' up (hol' up)
yeah, big shit poppin', everybody watchin'
when you do it like this, nigga


i wrote this record while thirty thousand feet in the air
stewardess complimenting me on my nappy hair
if i can fuck her in front of all of these passengers
they'll probably think i'm osama
the plane emergency landed, it was an honor
hol' up

uh, and lord knows she's beautiful
lord knows the usuals leaving her body sore
she take the little change she make to fix her nail cuticles
lipstick is suitable to make you fiend for more
she play mr. shakur, that's her favorite rapper
bumpin' "brenda's got a baby" while a pervert yellin' at her
and she capture features of a woman, but only seventeen
then seven cars start honking
she start running like flo-jo, don't care if they joe blow
if they got money to blow, a blow job is a sure go
and sure enough, don't see a dime of dirty dollars
just give it all to her daddy, but she don't know her father
that's ironic
see, a block away from lueders park, i seen an el camino parked
and in her heart, she hate it there, but in her mind, she made it where
nothin' really matters, so she hit the back seat
rosa parks never a factor when she makin' ends meet


and lord knows she's beautiful
lord knows the usuals leaving her body sore
her anatomy is god's temple
and it's quite simple, her castle is 'bout to be destroyed
she's always paranoid, watching the law inside the streets
undercovers, the dummies that look like decoys
remember sergeant let her slide
said if he seen what's between her thighs, he'd compromise
to no surprise
she took the ultimatum 'round the alleyway and gave him
a warm welcome, then felt him right below the navel
though he was wired up like a pair of jumping cables
his eyes was closed shut, prior charges, he had waived 'em
it was a block away from lueders park, i seen a squad car parked
and in her heart, she hate it there, but in her mind, she made it where
nothing really matters, so she hit the back seat
'cause rosa parks never a factor when she toppin' off police


and lord knows she's beautiful
lord knows the usuals leaving her body sore
as she bust down like a twelve-bunk on tour
she suddenly realize she'll never escape the allure
of a black man, white man needing satisfaction
at first, it became a practice, but now she's numb to it
sometimes she wonder if she can do it like nuns do it
but she never heard of catholic religion or sinner's redemption, that sounds foolish
and you can blame it on her mother
for letting her boyfriend slide candy under her cover
ten months before she was ten, he moved in and that's when he touched her
this motherfucker is the fuckin' reason why keisha rushing to that
block away from lueders park, i seen an el camino parked
and in her heart, she hate it there, but in her mind, she made it where
nothing really matters, still she hit the back seat
then caught a knife inside the bladder, left for dead, raped in the street
keisha's song, mmm
my little sister eleven, i looked her right in the face
the day that i wrote this song, sat her down and pressed play



check, check, check, check, check


it go ride to it, ride to it, 'cause you never know
when a bullet might hit and you die to it, die to it
die to it, die to it, live your life, live it right
be different, do different things
don't do it like he did, 'cause he ain't what you is
but we can win, wait, let's get straight to the point


to the meaning of life, what's my purpose?
maybe this earth is ain't a good place to be
how far is heaven? let's see
is it in the clouds like they said it would be?
i wonder when i die will he give me receipts?
i wonder will the eyes of the lord look at me?
look at me, look at me, i'm a loser, i'm a winner
i'm good, i'm bad, i'm a christian, i'm a sinner
i'm humble, i'm loud, i'm righteous, i'm a killer
what i'm doing? i'm saying that i'm human, now people just

ride to it, ride to it, 'cause you never know
when a bullet might hit and you die to it, die to it
die to it, die to it, live your life, live it right
be different, do different things
don't do it like he did, 'cause he ain't what you is
but we can win, wait, let's get straight to the point


it go one (one), two (two), three (three)
two in the front, one in the back seat (seat)
seat (seat), seat (seat), seat (seat)
looking for a victim of a ak-47, hundred-round each, each, each
but why must we retaliate? is it human nature?
i don't know, i look for the answers later
"make a right, there they go" (there they go)
sometimes gotta


ride to it, ride to it, 'cause you never know
when a bullet might hit and you die to it, die to it
die to it, die to it, live your life, live it right
be different, do different things
don't do it like he did, 'cause he ain't what you is
but we can win-win, wait, let's get straight to the point


as i open this book and then burn up some of this reefer
my plan is to figure out the world and escape all my demons
i'm dying inside, i wonder if zion inside the heavens
a condom, a rollie, pain, a fat blunt and a mac-11
that's all i see in my life and they tell me to make it right
but i'm right on the edge of everest and i might jump tonight
have you ever had known a saint that was taking sinner's advice?
well it's probably you, am i right? if i'm wrong, you a fucking liar
when i lie on my back and look at the ceiling, it's so appealing to pray
i wonder if i'm just a villain, dealing my morals away
some people look at my face then tell me don't worry 'bout it
i give 'em back they deposit, no money, just total silence
i'm running, they say i'm wildin', a youngin' with lack of guidance
that's hundreds of us with problems
mo' money, mo' drugs and violence
look at the soul of an out-of-control artist
that's dealing with life the hardest, that's on my life
but regardless i'ma—


ride to it, ride to it, 'cause i never know
when a bullet might hit me and i die to it, die to it
die to it, die to it, live my life, live it right
be different, do different things
don't do it like he did, 'cause he ain't what i is
but we can win, wait, let's get straight to the point
(oh-oh, oh-oh)
hmm



mic check ali
the mic don't sound right

even the shooters can get shot, get shot quick
even the shooters can get shot (ali get it right)
even the shooters can get shot, get shot quick
even the shooters can get shot
uhh


tell em i got plenty arson to sell em
heat by the fleet displaying it very seldomly
i write till i ignite my cerebellum
close to the pen like i had 3 felons
come from a city where niggas show no remorse
and a corpse is just another hommy taking it's course
of course my dream was to play in the final four
till the twelfth grade came and i was only 5'4
so now i'm a graduate looking to get hired
my pops knew a security job he inquired
but ignorance is bliss, that's what i was told
i stopped, dropped and rolled when somebody yelled fired
now there goes another black boy unemployed
with a lot of free time which means he's vulnerable to run into a lot of crime
i wrote it in my rhymes
and when i left the porch this is what i realized

(chorus)
even the shooters can get shot, get shot quick
even the shooters can get shot (yeah, yeah, yeah)
even the shooters can get shot, get shot quick
even the shooters can get shot (yeah, yeah, yeah, wassup?)
these streets ain't none to play with
it could get outrageous
got burners, .45's and gauges
that could really get outrageous


so i'm thinking to myself, what's next?
my security job only got me like 2 checks
my pops disappointed, told me i'm fuckin' up
irresponsible and i need some growing up
i told him i would go back, knowing i wouldn't go back
working a 9 to 5 is something i couldn't stomach
surrounded by the violence
all the goons and the goblins
with 99 problems i still kept it 100
these streets can be rather manipulating
especially when you're black and just turned 18
so what's a kid to do, when your fresh out of school and the negatives of the world constantly following you?
not to mention a local henchman, copped a sheriff's part like terrorists
osama with badges that talk arrogant
that boy 15 and he holdin' a .45
30 years apart, 30 years before he realized




uhh
soon as the beat drop, i bet some heat pop
on a block close to you like a relative
you sippin' belvedere while these niggas plannin' to rob mr. belvedere
yeah i'm a good kid tryna stay righteous as martin luther but it seems like all of my friends eventually become shooters
and niggas bangin' on you is something that you'll get used to
you can either fight back or run home and grab your ruger
whatever you do just make sure you're willing to do it
being too indecisive can get you killed inside your buick
cuz you stopped at the light, 5 minutes from midnight
with no tinted windows that nigga surely had shot through it
you tell me you listening, but you don't hear the music
call you billy hoyle when turmoil was near
this is the realest right here
when i lost my very first job
my pops said why?
i said i couldn't aim for the sky
cuz even shooters can get shot


(yeah, yeah, yeah, wassup?)
these streets ain't none to play with
it could get outrageous
got burners, .45's and gauges
that could really get outrageous

smoke good, eat good, live good
smoke good, eat good, live good
smoke good, eat good, live good

i used to want to see the penitentiary way after elementary
thought it was cool to look the judge in the face when he sentenced me
since my uncles was institutionalized
my intuition had said i was suited for family ties
my mama is stressin', my daddy tired
i need me a weapon, these niggas ride
every minute, hour, and second, ministers tried to save me
how i'm gon' listen when i don't even hear god?
heaven or hell, base it all on my instincts
my hands dirty, you worried 'bout mud in your sink
you like to mistake a street nigga for real nigga
the same nigga that kill with you'll squeal with you
i deal with you like my son, stare at the sun
and you'll be looking in my eyes, homie
stand for something or fall for anything
and you working with two left feet at the skating rink
but anyway, this for my niggas
uncles, twenty-three hours, sendin' me pictures
i want you to know that i'm so determined to blow
that you hear the music i wrote, hope it get you off death row
you came home to a pocket full of stones
a metro pc phone, then you went back in
so when i touch the pen, the pen is in my view
i'ma get it right, just so you


smoke good, eat good, live good
smoke good, eat good, live good
smoke good, eat good, live good
smoke good, eat good, live good
smoke good, eat good, live good


you like to mistake a street nigga for real nigga
the same nigga that kill with you'll squeal with you
i like to start it out from the bottom and build with you
be on my last dollar and split the bill with you
i'm twenty-three with morals and plans of living cordial
not rich, but wealthy, there's nothing you can tell me
my killings are not remorseful
the city got my back, and for that, i give them my torso
you think about it and don't call me lyrical
'cause really i'm just a nigga that's evil and spiritual
i know some rappers using big words to make they similes curve
my simplest shit be more pivotal
i penetrate the hearts of good kids and criminals
worrisome individuals that live life critical
so won't you bear witness while i bare feet?
so you can walk in my shoes and get to know me
but anyway, this for my pops
on his lunch break eating in that parking lot
on "wanna be heard," probably thought he worked my nerves
but really he was stressing me gettin' what i deserve
somebody said my name on the radio
he ain't know i was ready for the world that minute
so the next time he roll up and drop grams in it
he probably be out of work, laid back, while he


smoke good, eat good, live good
smoke good, eat good, live good
smoke good, eat good, live good
smoke good, eat good, live good
smoke good, eat good, live good

ali recorded and i'm morpheus, the matrix of my mind
i'm out the orbit, you an orphan and a hairdresser combined
i'm on the toilet when i rhyme, if you the shit, then i decline
i climax where you begin and then i end on cloud nine
and that's important when you morph into an angel in the sky
and don't be forging all my signatures, my listeners reply
and tell me that you biting style, you got a hell of an appetite
and i'ma be here for a while, just buckle up before the ride
or knuckle up if you can fight, we always making 'em duck or die
a suit and tie is suitable and usual in suicide
csi just might investigate this fucking parasite
(he dead, amen)
that's what they telling me

ferragami so many and cool enough for the '70s
nigga, payback's a bitch, and bitch, you been livin' in debt with me

solar system and barbecue, nothing else you can do

i'm marilyn manson, don't ask for your favorite rapper
(he dead), yup-yup (amen), i know
(he dead), for sure (amen), amen
got me breathing with dragons
i'll crack the egg in your basket, you bastard
i'm marilyn manson, don't ask for your favorite rapper

i wrapped him and made him casper, i capture the likes of nasa
my pedigree to fly past ya, i'll pass the weed to the pastor
we all are sinners, won't you send us to bible study faster?
your hypocritist reaction a blasphemy, i assassin my casualty
and it's casually done, and tell 'em my salary come
in lump sum one hundreds, don't talk to me 'bout no money
the sun is under my feet, and i come in peace to compete
i don't run if you'd rather leap, my statistics go up in weeks
and i go visit the nearest creek, and i get busy on many mc
really ballistic, anybody can see
any assistance, everybody deceased
some persistence, recognize i be
really too vicious, the permanent beast
and the demolition breaking up the street
better partition, better dot your t
and i gon' mention how the far you see
putting my dick in the rap industry
everybody bitching, getting mad at me
recognize kendrick in the battery
and i'm charged up, and the catastrophe

welcome to vigilante, '80s, so don't you ask me
i'm hungry, my body's antsy, i rip through your fuckin' pantry

granny said when i'm old enough, i'll be sure to be all i can be
you niggas marcus camby, washed up
pussy, fix your panties, i'm mr. marcus, you gettin' fucked, uh
you ain't heard nothin' harder since daddy kane
take it in vain, vicodins couldn't ease the pain
lightning bolts hit your body, you thought it rained
not a cloud in sight, just the shit that i write
strong enough to stand in front of a travelin' freight train, are you trained?
to go against dracula, draggin' the record industry by my fangs
ak clips, money clips, and gold chains
you walk around with a p90 like it's the '90s
bullet to your temple, your homicide'll remind me

bompton pirus ain't nothin' to fuck with
compton éses ain't nothin' to fuck with

let's hit the county buildin', gotta cash my check
spend it all on a forty-ounce to the neck
and in retrospect, i remember december being the hottest
squad cars, neighborhood wars, and stolen mazdas
i tell you motherfuckers that life is full of hydraulics
up and down, get a six-four, better know how to drive it
i'm drivin' on e with no license or registration
heart racin', racin' past johnny because he's racist
1987, the children of ronald reagan
rake the leaves off your front porch with a machine blowtorch (i'm really out here, my nigga)
he blowin' on stress, hopin' to ease the stress (like, really out here)
he coppin' some blow, hopin' that it can stretch
newborn massacre
hoppin' out the passenger with calendars 'cause your day comin'
run him down and then he gun him down, i'm hopin' that you fast enough
even the legs of michael johnson don't mean nothin', because


compton crip niggas ain't nothin' to fuck with

this, this, this
should be played at high volume
preferably in a residential
life’s a bitch, life’s a bitch
but i’mma keep the pussy wet (yep)
i’mma keep the pussy wet (yep)
i’mma keep the pussy wet (yep)
i’mma keep the pussy wet (yep)
my dick hard, her pussy wet


and i’m born with my dick in the earth
you can tell me how much am i worth
i’mma die with my heart on my sleeve
many die on their hands and their knees
and i’m takin’ whatever i need
and i’m raping the government fees
and you’re wasting your time
and i’m speaking my mind on whatever i think
and i think that i’m richard pryor
with priors of 32 fiends
and that means that i hear for higher
tell me why are you starin’ at me?
matta fact, man, your eyes is wired
you inspired by kendrick the king
maybe it’s ’cause i’m living my dream
man, i sing what i’m living about
and the words that come out of my mouth
they requires a random routine
of being organic granite
then my access is granted
to represent the shit that i conceive
and i guarantee that i’mma bring
my mind, body, soul
and i sold all these records off bein’ myself
and i wish you can do the same thing, man
it’s easier than a stripper
or tyin’ a baby shoestring, you stringing along
and really why you writing a song?
your passion for music is never in sync
no secret societies guided me to the world of unseen
and they tell me life is a bitch, who gives a shit?
you'll get relief

i’mma keep the pussy wet (yep)
i’mma keep the pussy wet (yep)
my dick hard, her pussy wet
i'mma keep the pussy wet (yep)

(hi, ho!) i came
(bye, ho!) i went
(hi, ho!) i came
(bye, ho!) i went
(hi, ho!) i came

(bitch-bitch-bitch-bitch-bitch-bitch-bitch-bitch-bitch, bitch, bitch, bitch)


and i see that you envy of me
enemigos don’t prosper
better yet, they do die eventually
if i’m at the event you will leave
‘cause you know and i know that
i go ham even if muslims is seen
in my rearview i’m near you
but i don’t hear you, can you at least breathe?
with an oxygen mask, and
the masses keep saying i’m speaking for them
and if you can imagine my madness
then you can see where i’ve been
and the places the louis has been
and i swear i been doing this when
you was in pajamas, watching b-barney and friends
and you couldn’t harm me even with ten
weapons of your choice riding in
army tanks, you shot blanks
and i shot back, make your duplex bend
what the fuck you think? if i don’t think
then i’m right back where the city sin
what the fuck you drink?
thinking i can’t write these raps in the lions’ den
when i hear that you lyin’, then?
it’s murder she wrote, ain’t no hope
you go downhill, man, where’s your slope?
get thrown downhill tied to a rope
tell the world to put intervals
man, i swear this the anecdote
and they tell me that life is a bitch
who gives a shit when you know?



and i see that you envy of me
don’t prosper, better yet, they do die eventually
cause you know and i know that i go ham even if muslims is seen
in my rearview i’m near you
but i don't hear you, can you at least breathe?

(hi, ho!)
(bye, ho!)

she be like


fuck them other niggas 'cause i'm down for my nigga
fuck them other niggas 'cause i'm down for my nigga
fuck them other niggas, i'll ride for my nigga
i'll die for my nigga, fuck them other—


until one day, he wasn't acting right
in the middle of the night, she checked his phone, erica, right?
when he pled the fifth, man, it was on, matter fact, she gone
matter fact, tyrone was on speed dial, so when she got home
it was going down, she go


fuck that other nigga when she tired of her nigga
fuck that other nigga when she tired of her nigga
fuck that other nigga when she tired of her nigga
sick of lies from her nigga, fuck that other—


i know this girl, she a real hood girl, and she with the shit

she be like


fuck them other niggas 'cause i'm down for my nigga
fuck them other niggas 'cause i'm down for my nigga
fuck them other niggas, i'll ride for my nigga
i'll die for my nigga, fuck them other—


until one day, he wasn't acting right
in the middle of the night, she checked his pockets, found condoms by
magnum, and the moment they was acknowledged, she popped his eye
then ran outside, then started drivin' on the passenger side
homeboy was smiling, she gon'


fuck that other nigga when she tired of her nigga
fuck that other nigga when she tired of her nigga
fuck that other nigga when she tired of her nigga
sick of lies from her nigga, fuck that other—


and so these girls, these vulnerable girls
took they men up, put 'em in they world, they vulnerable world
and just like that, it was only gettin', got they feelings hurt
tell me how that sound? they got fed up with the biggest question mark
they curious now
'cause when women get sick of men, they think of a big helping hand
to lend each other, uncover emotions when lights dim
so when she telling her to come over, it'll be alright
the minute she hit the block and turn left, she'll be turning dyke, they go


fuck with other bitches when they tired of these niggas
fuck with other bitches when they tired of these niggas
fuck with other bitches on the side 'cause these niggas—

i swear you people don't know kendrick, you don't know him
but you say you want some more kendrick, i'm 'bout to show 'em
everything inside this human being, i'm still growing
i'm a premature baby in this crazy life that we adore
doors on the lamborghini, i want 'em
can't afford 'em so i tell the swap meet to clone 'em
i guess i really am a vanity slave
i guess my ancestors turning in they graves
burning money when i get it, fuck a life savings
overdraft bank statements, just to make a statement
when i put this fashion on, i'm a fashion junkie
picking cotton in the country, i bought this out the country
whips and chains, whips and chains, jacob know my name
he call me kunta, you my brother, we come from the same modern world
that's ya girl? i see she rocking fendi
try this on
if it ain't upscale then you may offend me
copping everything in sight, ignoring they sacrifice
amnesia if i see the black visa in my hand tonight
i show my dick and then i swipe, that's a punchline
they was hot and i wore ice, that's ironic huh?


word around town that i'm all about the bitches
word around town that i love my 26's
word around town that i gotta stay paid
lord please forgive me i'm a vanity slave
it's the gucci cock and shoot
found my swag but lost my roof, (burr! burr!)
lord please forgive me i'm a vanity slave
see my audemar tick, as my audemar tock
lord please forgive me i'm a vanity slave


aw man videos got me wanting hoes
appetite for flashing lights, all i can do is pose
a black male... on melrose. i should get blackmailed
by my people hell rose, niggas that ain't had shit
for 400 years overcompensate by over accessorizing with gear
man y'all don't see my vision
i do it for the love of hip hop and the love of bitches
am i a hypocrite cause everyday i'm contradicting
i think of how i'm living, then i watch "how i'm living" i know this can't be right
my conscience tell me to stay righteous
it's unlikely to see what i like and say i don't like it
biggest dilemma my priorities ignoring me, i wanna move accordingly
but baby steps are premature remember?
i'm flying to the south and i'll be gone 'til november
to see my family tree but this a shame i'm yelling, out, timber


word around town that i'm all about the bitches
word around town that i love my 26's

take these motherfucking jordan's off, put on my loafs
cause nothing goes bad, everytime i wear (gucci)
i'm getting more ass, everytime i wear (gucci)
they told me it's a fad, everytime i wear (gucci)
but should i give a fuck when it bring me more coochie?
this a young nigga's pedigree, i pray the lord can better me
if not he 'bout to strike me down like this my third felony
the voices keep on telling me, kendrick don't forget about us
i burned my wardrobe, hoping that i could live without it


word around town that i'm all about the bitches
word around town that i love my 26's
word around town that i gotta stay paid
lord please forgive me i'm a vanity slave
it's the gucci cock and shoot
found my swag but lost my roof, (burr! burr!)
lord please forgive me i'm a vanity slave
see my audemar tick, as my audemar tock
lord please forgive me i'm a vanity slave
