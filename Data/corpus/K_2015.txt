dick hard like rottweiler
can you handle it? can you handle it? woo woo, woo woo

the whole industry been in shambles
everybody fugazi, i’m just changing the channel
kendrick lamar, the people’s champion, i'm animal for analysts
career damaging verses, meditating with candles lit
i like my raps extra prolific
since freestyling on lunch tables and park benches
and i won’t mention my 10,000 hours in training
while juggling, gang-banging, my balancing was tremendous
and now we look at the competition as quick submission
they tappin’ out before we even get a chance to miss ‘em
what this about, is it money or skill?
maybe it’s both and i got large amounts of it, it’s real
you see my oath is very unbreakable, my style is never mistakable
i can see y’all incapable
to be the god emcees, you know me well
ridiculous, venomous, hate in my heart, the sinister
run for cover, my lineage prove itself
i’m rollin’ deep in that paper like two adeles
before scholars, i flowed tighter than virgin lips
we here to shake the game up and you're flying through turbulence
everything is high stakes nowadays, that’s how it played nowadays
it’s like an 8-ball to the face nowadays
i'm laced nowadays, my gun is off the waist nowadays
it’s seven figures and retainer for the case nowadays, i'm talking
higher power, every other hour since eddie bauer
since stash boxes and lead showers, breaking the padlock
and the dead coward dying a thousand deaths, entire lion
surround itself with bears, watch it nigga, you share a profit, ah!
this is what they want, i’m the one
this is vintage from 1980 somethin'
i’m the son of the pioneer that got you near the sun
play with him, bitch you better off voting for donald trump
i’m yelling mr. kanye west for president
he probably let me get some head inside the residence
i’m in the white house going all out
bumping college dropout, god bless americans
nothing more influential than rap music
i merge jazz fusion with the trap music
i mix black soul with some rock and roll
they never box me in, i’m david blaine-ing all you hoes
oh yea, let’s go there, my dna is dmt, i’m so rare
my juvenile was wilder than the nolia
a locomotive couldn’t track me down in my career
runnin’ this shit with four pair, son of my bitch, i might demolish
a bitch right in front ya, chico, what have you done here?
d-bo, all of it one year, mississippi to california
it gets annoying, niggas wanna deplore him
and bitches wanna adore him, but industry shit ain’t for him
probably thinking it’s for him, only one me
swallowed the key and kicking the door in, never leasing my foreign
mr. valevictorian studied the game before them
listen to you with boredom, baby rappers, abort them
to the grave i deport them, corporations extort them
i’m snapping off my endorphins, i alien mighty morphin’
my radiance rather gorgeous, hundred bill to the doorman
hundred mil' in my fortune, they call me back in the morning
you're racing against the tortoise, pace myself it’s important
lace myself with the wisdom my playerism enormous
so pay the man for performance, saucy all of my garments
jimi kendrix performing, this fucking studio haunted (ah!)
i tell a bitch don’t sweat me (don't sweat me)
i kill this whole fuckin’ beat if cole let me (please cole)
ib should’ve never sent the instrumental
every time i start writing i get sentimental
this shit is just not fair
but why the fuck should i care?
the story of your life here
two young stars was born and y’all gon’ die here
oh lord, gotta be the yams
billboard list need 2pac, damn
but number 9 makes sure he lives on, yeah
hoochie, coochie, pussies in a trance
every day a celebration, but even the valley peaking me
is not validation, nigga this tde
and my doggies be salivating, salaries, better ratings
and casualties all around me, don’t make me do demonstrations
whoa
murder my allegations and burning my finger traces
adjourning my power patience and earning royalty payments
i’m sorry y’all not relating, this party is reservated
i kill this whole muthafucking beat if j. cole say it
my nigga ib chopped the instrumental, i gotta slay it
i gotta lay it, gotta show you fuckers i’m not to play with
the ruckus had been my favorite, king kunta the fuckin’ greatest
whoa
burnin’ my leather-
(nah i’m just fuckin’ wit cha)

so you better go hard every time you jump on wax, my nigga
fuck what they talkin' 'bout, your shit is where it's at, my nigga
came in this game, you stuck your fangs in this game
you wore no chain in this game, your hood, your name in this game
now you double up, time to bubble up the bread and huddle up
stickin' to the scripts, now, here, if them benjamins go cuddle up
skip, hop, drip, drop
flip, flop with the white tube sock
it goes, "sherm sticks, burn this"
that's what the product smell like when the chemicals mix
50-nigga salute, out the compton zoo, with the extras
el co's, monte carlos, road kings, and dressers
rip ridaz, p-funkers, mexicans, they fuck with you
asians, they fuck with you, nobody can fuck with you


i been a-1 since day one, you niggas boo-boo
your homeboy, your block that you're from, boo-boo
lil' hoes you went to school with, boo-boo
baby mama and your new bitch, boo-boo
we was in the hood, fourteen with the deuce-deuce
fourteen years later, going hard like we used to
on the dead homies

hopped out the caddy, just got my dick sucked
the little homies called and said, "the enemies done cliqued up"
oh, yeah? puto want to squabble with mi barrio?
oh, yeah? tell 'em they can run it for the cardio
oh, yeah? everything is everything, it's scandalous
slow motion for the ambulance, the project filled with cameras
the lapd gamblin', scramblin', football numbers slanderin'
niggas' names on paper—you snitched all summer
streets don't fail me now
they tell me it's a new gang in town
from compton to congress
set-trippin' all around
ain't nothin' new but a flu of new demo-crips and re-blood-icans
red state versus a blue state—which one you governin'?
they give us guns and drugs, call us thugs, make it they promise to fuck with you
no condom, they fuck with you, obama say, "what it do?"


obama say, "what it do?"
obama say, "what it do?"
obama say, "what it do?"

we was in the hood, fourteen with the deuce-deuce
fourteen years later, going hard like we used to
on the dead homies
on the dead homies


everybody want to talk about who this and who that
who the realest and who wack, or who white or who black
critics want to mention that they miss when hip-hop was rappin'
motherfucker, if you did, then killer mike'd be platinum
y'all priorities fucked up, put energy in wrong shit
hennessy and crown vic, my memory been gone since
don't ask about no camera blocking at award shows
no, don't ask about my bitch, no, don't ask about my vogues
'less you askin' me about power, yeah, i got a lot of it
i'm the only nigga next to snoop that can push the button
had the coast on standby
"k. dot, what up? i heard they opened up pandora's box"
i box 'em all in, by a landslide
nah, homie, we too sensitive, it spill out to the streets
i make the call and get the coast involved, then history repeats
but i resolved inside that private hall while sitting down with jay
he said, "it's funny how one verse could fuck up the game"


i been a-1 since day one, you niggas boo-boo


how much a dollar really cost?
the question is detrimental, paralyzin' my thoughts
parasites in my stomach keep me with a gut feeling, y'all
gotta see how i'm chillin' once i park this luxury car
hopping out feeling big as mutombo
"20 on pump 6," dirty marcellus called me dumbo
twenty years ago, can't forget
now i can lend him a ear or two
how to stack these residuals tenfold
the liberal concept of what men'll do
"20 on 6," he didn't hear me
indigenous african only spoke zulu
my american tongue was leery
walked out the gas station
a homeless man with a semi-tan complexion
asked me for ten rand, stressin' about dry land
deep water, powder blue skies that crack open
a piece of crack that he wanted, i knew he was smokin'
he begged and pleaded
asked me to feed him twice, i didn't believe it
told him, "beat it"
contributin' money just for his pipe—i couldn't see it
he said, "my son, temptation is one thing that i've defeated
listen to me, i want a single bill from you
nothin' less, nothin' more"
i told him i ain't have it and closed my door
tell me, how much a dollar cost?


he's starin' at me in disbelief
my temper is buildin', he's starin' at me, i grab my key
he's starin' at me, i started the car, then i tried to leave
and somethin' told me to keep it in park until i could see
the reason why he was mad at a stranger
like i was supposed to save him
like i'm the reason he's homeless and askin' me for a favor
he's starin' at me, his eyes followed me with no laser
he's starin' at me, i notice that his stare is contagious
'cause now i'm starin' back at him, feelin' some type of disrespect
if i could throw a bat at him, it'd be aimin' at his neck
i never understood someone beggin' for goods
askin' for handouts, takin' it if they could
and this particular person just had it down pat
starin' at me for the longest until he finally asked
"have you ever opened up exodus 14?
a humble man is all that we ever need"
tell me, how much a dollar cost?

guilt trippin' and feelin' resentment
i never met a transient that demanded attention
they got me frustrated, indecisive and power trippin'
sour emotions got me lookin' at the universe different
i should distance myself, i should keep it relentless
my selfishness is what got me here, who the fuck i'm kiddin'?
so i'ma tell you like i told the last bum
crumbs and pennies, i need all of mines
and i recognize this type of panhandlin' all the time
i got better judgment, i know when nigga's hustlin', keep in mind
when i was strugglin', i did compromise, now i comprehend
i smell grandpa's old medicine, reekin' from your skin
moonshine and gin, nigga, you're babblin', your words ain't flatterin'
i'm imaginin' denzel but lookin' at o'neal
kazaam is sad thrills, your gimmick is mediocre
the jig is up, i seen you from a mile away losin' focus
and i'm insensitive, and i lack empathy
he looked at me and said, "your potential is bittersweet"
i looked at him and said, "every nickel is mines to keep"
he looked at me and said, "know the truth, it'll set you free
you're lookin' at the messiah, the son of jehovah, the higher power
the choir that spoke the word, the holy spirit
the nerve of nazareth, and i'll tell you just how much a dollar cost
the price of having a spot in heaven, embrace your loss—i am god"



i got a bone to pick
i don't want you monkey-mouth motherfuckers
sittin' in my throne again
ayy, ayy, nigga, what's happenin'?
k-dot back in the hood, nigga!
i'm mad (he mad!), but i ain't stressin'
true friends, one question


bitch, where you when i was walkin'?
now i run the game, got the whole world talkin'
king kunta, everybody wanna cut the legs off him
kunta, black man taking no losses, oh yeah
bitch, where you when i was walkin'?
now i run the game, got the whole world talkin'
king kunta, everybody wanna cut the legs off him
when you got the yams—(what's the yams?)


the yam is the power that be
you can smell it when i'm walkin' down the street
(oh yes, we can, oh yes, we can)
i can dig rappin', but a rapper with a ghostwriter?
what the fuck happened? (oh no!)
i swore i wouldn't tell, but most of y'all sharing bars
like you got the bottom bunk in a two-man cell (a two-man cell)
something's in the water (something's in the water)
and if i gotta brown-nose for some gold
then i'd rather be a bum than a motherfuckin' baller (oh yeah!)


bitch, where you when i was walkin'?
now i run the game, got the whole world talkin'
king kunta, everybody wanna cut the legs off him
king kunta, black man taking no losses, oh yeah
bitch, where you when i was walkin'?
now i run the game, got the whole world talkin'
king kunta, everybody wanna cut the legs off him
when you got the yams—(what's the yams?)


the yam brought it out of richard pryor
manipulated bill clinton with desires
twenty-four-seven, three-sixty-five days times two
i was contemplatin' gettin' off stage
just to go back to the hood, see my enemy, and say… (oh yeah)


bitch, where you when i was walkin'?
now i run the game, got the whole world talkin'
king kunta, everybody wanna cut the legs off him
kunta, black man taking no losses, oh yeah
bitch, where you when i was walkin'?
now i run the game, got the whole world talkin'
king kunta, everybody wanna cut the legs off him


you goat-mouth mammyfucker
i was gonna kill a couple rappers, but they did it to themselves
everybody's suicidal, they ain't even need my help
this shit is elementary, i'll probably go to jail
if i shoot at your identity and bounce to the left
stuck a flag in my city, everybody's screamin', "compton!"
i should probably run for mayor when i'm done, to be honest
and i put that on my momma and my baby boo too
twenty million walkin' out the court buildin', woo-woo!
aw, yeah, fuck the judge
i made it past twenty-five, and there i was
a little nappy-headed nigga with the world behind him
life ain't shit but a fat vagina
screamin', "annie, are you okay? annie, are you okay?"
limo tinted with the gold plates
straight from the bottom, this the belly of the beast
from a peasant to a prince to a motherfuckin' king (oh yeah)


bitch, where you when i was walkin'—*gunshot*
by the time you hear the next pop
the funk shall be within you—*gunshot*
now i run the game, got the whole world talkin'
king kunta, everybody wanna cut the legs off him
king kunta, black man taking no losses, oh yeah
bitch, where you when i was walkin'?
now i run the game, got the whole world talkin'
king kunta, everybody wanna cut the legs off him


funk, funk, funk, funk, funk, funk, funk, funk, funk, funk, funk
we want the funk

now if i give you the funk, you gon' take it?

now if i give you the funk, you gon' take it?
we want the funk



this feelin' is unmatched
this feelin' is brought to you by adrenaline and good rap
black pendleton ball cap (west, west, west)
we don't share the same synonym, fall back (west, west, west)
been in it before internet had new acts
mimicking radio's nemesis made me wack (ooh-ooh)
my innocence limited, the experience lacked
ten of us with no tentative tactic that cracked
the mind of a literate writer, but i did it, in fact (yeah)
you admitted it once i submitted it, wrapped in plastic
remember scribblin', scratchin' diligent sentences backwards
visiting freestyle cyphers for your reaction
now, i can live in a stadium, pack it the fastest
gamblin' benjamin benefits, sinnin' in traffic
spinnin' women in cartwheels, linen fabric on fashion
winnin' in every decision, kendrick is master that mastered it
isn't it lovely how menaces turned attraction?
pivotin' rappers, finish your fraction while writing blue magic
thank god for rap
i would say it got me a plaque, but what's better than that?
the fact it brought me back home


i know everything
i know everything, know myself
i know morality, spirituality, good and bad health
i know fatality might haunt you
i know everything
i know compton, i know street shit,i know shit that's conscious
i know everything, i know lawyers, advertisement and sponsors
i know wisdom, i know bad religion, i know good karma
i know everything, i know history
i know the universe works mentally
i know the perks of bullshit isn't meant for me
i know everything, i know cars, clothes, hoes, and money
i know loyalty, i know respect, i know those that's ornery
i know everything, the highs, the lows, the groupies, the junkies
i know if i'm generous at heart, i don't need recognition
the way i'm rewarded—well, that's god's decision
i know you know that line's for compton school district
just give it to the kids, don’t gossip 'bout how it was distributed
i know how people work
i know the price of life, i'm knowin' how much it’s worth
i know what i know, and i know it well not to ever forget
until i realized i didn’t know shit, the day i came home


i met a little boy that resembled my features
nappy afro, gap in his smile, hand-me-down sneakers
bounced through the crowd
run a number on man and woman that crossed him
sun beamin' on his beady beads, exhausted
tossin' footballs with his ashy, black ankles
breakin' new laws, mama passed on home trainin'
he looked at me and said, "kendrick, you do know my language
you just forgot because of what public schools had painted"
oh, i forgot, "don't kill my vibe," that's right, you're famous
i used to watch on channel 5, tv was taken
but never mind, you're here right now, don't you mistake it
it's just a new trip, take a glimpse of your family ancestor
make a new list of everything you thought was progress
and that was bullshit, i know your life is full of turmoil
spoiled by fantasies of who you are, i feel bad for you
i can attempt to enlighten you without frightenin' you
if you resist, i'll back off quick, go catch a flight or two
but if you pick destiny over rest-in-peace
then be an advocate, tell your homies, especially
to come back home"


this is a world premiere (this is a world premiere)
this is a world premiere (this is a world premiere)
this is a world premiere


i say, where you at? from the front to the back
i'm lookin' for you, i react only when you react
ah, i thought i found you, back in the ghetto
when i was seventeen with the .38 special
maybe you're in a dollar bill, maybe you're not real
maybe only the wealthy get to know how you feel
maybe i'm paranoid, ha, maybe i don't need you anyway
don't lie to me, i'm suicidal anyway
i can be your advocate
i can preach for you if you tell me what the matter is

you never knew a plug, plug, plug, a plug like this
sophisticated gangsta, watch me thug like this
snatch your, uh, in a club like this
seven zeros, need my pub like this
stuck in a rock in a hard place
i am thinkin' i won't bump y'all up, well, i am
i got to get my thing off
my style come from devin the dude, kurupt, 2
and james brown with his fist crossed
i fluctuate the vocals like prince rogers
whoever thought a billionaire come out of compton?
multiply simple logic, it's rules you can follow
if dre ain't motivation, i don't know who is
gift and a curse, maybe them shoes is too big
or maybe i'm too pessimistic to know i'm gifted
chasin' hood rat brownie points and bullshittin'
i dropped the four on 'em, scrapin', hopped a four on 'em
grab my dick and pour on 'em
yeah, homie, i'm still talkin' that whoop-de-whoop
hoppin' out on my enemies, i know who to shoot
back when my homies where i need to be
such a familiar sceneries, i smell the gun smoke
i watched a homie watch his son smoke
i seen the sun set on my set
i seen one 'ru and one loc, one slip and one played him close
everythin' subject to change
nowadays, the compton crip car kill each other
faster than an opposite color
homies whack out everythin', you're dead, homie
it's your mother, your uncle and brother
if god was a loc, he'd probably had one comin'
damn, that's fucked up, i guess it is
when you can't trust not a soul inside these streets
i made a video out there in copenhagen, so the homies can see
to let 'em know it's more than just pamela lee
they said, "good looking"
paused the video the moment his phone ring
that fast dollar was his only problem
no matter how many times i showed him the eiffel tower
the block was home and africa was too far for power
then i knew


and you don't and you don't and you don't
and you don't and you don't and you don't
and you don't and you don't and you don't
and you don't and you don't stop

can i get one more?


everybody want to talk about who this and who that
who the realest and who wack, who white or who black
critics want to mention that they miss when hip hop was rappin’
motherfuck if they did, then a nigga'd be platinum
y’all priorities are fucked up, put energy in wrong shit
hennessy and crown vic, my memory been gone since
don’t ask about no politician at award shows
no, don’t ask about my, hoes, no, don’t ask about my foes
'less you askin' me about power, yeah, i got a lot of it
i’m the only nigga next to snoop that can push the button
had the coast on standby
“k. dot, what up? i heard they opened up pandora’s box”
i box ‘em all in, buyin' land stock

everything black, i don't want black (they want us to bow)
i want everything black, i ain't need black (down to our knees)
some white, some black, i ain't mean black (and pray to the god)
i want everything black (we don't believe)
everything black, want all things black
i don't need black, want everything black
don't need black, our eyes ain't black
i own black, own everything black


six in the morn'
fire in the street
burn, baby, burn (you, you, you, you, you)
that's all i wanna see (you, you, you, you, you)
and sometimes i get off watchin' you die in vain
it's such a shame, they may call me crazy
they may say i suffer from schizophrenia or somethin'
but homie, you made me (you, you, you, you, you)
black don't crack, my nigga

i'm the biggest hypocrite of 2015
once i finish this, witnesses will convey just what i mean
been feelin' this way since i was sixteen, came to my senses
you never liked us anyway, fuck your friendship, i meant it
i'm african-american, i'm african, i'm black as the moon
heritage of a small village, pardon my residence
came from the bottom of mankind
my hair is nappy, my dick is big, my nose is round and wide
you hate me, don't you?
you hate my people, your plan is to terminate my culture
you're fuckin' evil
i want you to recognize that i'm a proud monkey
you vandalize my perception but can't take style from me
and this is more than confession
i mean i might press the button just so you know my discretion
i'm guardin' my feelings, i know that you feel it
you sabotage my community, makin' a killin'
you made me a killer, emancipation of a real nigga


the blacker the berry, the sweeter the juice
the blacker the berry, the sweeter the juice
the blacker the berry, the sweeter the juice
the blacker the berry, the bigger i shoot

i'm the biggest hypocrite of 2015
once i finish this, witnesses will convey just what i mean
i mean, it's evident that i'm irrelevant to society
that's what you're tellin' me, penitentiary would only hire me
curse me 'til i'm dead, church me with your fake prophesizing
that i'ma be just another slave in my head
institutionalized manipulation and lies
reciprocation of freedom only live in your eyes
you hate me, don't you?
i know you hate me just as much as you hate yourself
jealous of my wisdom and cards i dealt
watchin' me as i pull up, fill up my tank, then peel out
muscle cars like pull-ups, show you what these big wheels 'bout, ah
black and successful, this black man meant to be special
katzkins on my radar, bitch, how can i help you?
how can i tell you i'm making a killin'?
you made me a killer, emancipation of a real nigga


the blacker the berry, the sweeter the juice
the blacker the berry, the sweeter the juice
the blacker the berry, the sweeter the juice
the blacker the berry, the bigger i shoot

i'm the biggest hypocrite of 2015
when i finish this, if you listen, then sure you will agree
this plot is bigger than me, it's generational hatred
it's genocism, it's grimy, little justification
i'm african-american, i'm african
i'm black as the heart of a fuckin' aryan
i'm black as the name of tyrone and darius, excuse my french
but fuck you — no, fuck y'all, that's as blunt as it gets
i know you hate me, don't you?
you hate my people, i can tell 'cause it's threats when i see you
i can tell 'cause your ways deceitful
know i can tell because you in love with that desert eagle
thinkin' maliciously, he get a chain then you gon' bleed him
it's funny how zulu and xhosa might go to war
two tribal armies that wanna build and destroy
remind me of these compton crip gangs that live next door
beefin' with pirus, only death settle the score
so don't matter how much i say i like to preach with the panthers
or tell georgia state "marcus garvey got all the answers"
or try to celebrate february like it's my b-day
or eat watermelon, chicken, and kool-aid on weekdays
or jump high enough to get michael jordan endorsements
or watch bet 'cause urban support is important
so why did i weep when trayvon martin was in the street
when gang-banging make me kill a nigga blacker than me?
hypocrite!




*woman moaning*
if these walls could talk
if these walls could talk
if these walls could talk
if these walls could talk
if these walls could talk
if these walls could talk—
sex

she just want to close her eyes and sway
with you, with you, with you (ah, come on)
exercise her right to work it out
it's true, it's true, it's true
shout out to the birthday girls
say hey (hey), say hey (hey), (ah, girl)
everyone deserves a night to play (play)
she plays, only when you tell her no


if these walls could talk, they'd tell me to swim good
no boat, i float better than he would
no life jacket, i'm not the god of nazareth
but your flood can be misunderstood
walls telling me they full of pain, resentment
need someone to live in them just to relieve tension
me, i'm just a tenant
landlord said these walls vacant more than a minute
these walls are vulnerable, exclamation
interior pink, color coordinated
i interrogated every nook and cranny
i mean, it's still amazing, before they couldn't stand me
these walls want to cry tears
these walls happier when i'm here
these walls never could hold up
every time i come around, demolition might crush


if these walls could talk, they'd tell me to go deep
yelling at me continuously, i can see
your defense mechanism is my decision
knock these walls down, that's my religion
walls feeling like they ready to close in
i suffocate, then catch my second wind
i resonate in these walls
i don't know how long i can wait in these walls
i've been on the streets too long
looking at you from the outside in
they sing the same old song
about how they walls always the cleanest
i beg to differ, i must've missed them
i'm not involved, i'd rather diss 'em
i'd rather call on you, put your wall up
'cause when i come around, demolition gon' crush


if your walls could talk, they'd tell you it's too late
your destiny accepted your fate
burn accessories and stash them on the yard
take the recipe, the bible and god
wall telling you that commissary is low
race wars happening, no calling co
no calling your mother to save you
homies to say you're irrepetible, not acceptable
your behavior is sammy the bull like
a killer that turned snitch
walls is telling me you a bitch
you pray for appeals hoping the warden would afford them
that sentence so important
walls telling you to listen to "sing about me"
retaliation is strong, you even dream 'bout me
killed my homeboy and god spared your life
dumb criminal got indicted same night
so when you play this song, rewind the first verse
about me abusing my power so you can hurt
about me and her in the shower whenever she horny
about me and her in the after hours of the morning
about her baby daddy currently serving life
and how she think about you until we meet up at night
about the only girl that cared about you when you asked her
and how she fuckin' on a famous rapper
walls can talk (talk)



at first, i did love you
but now i just wanna fuck
late nights thinkin' of you
until i get my nut
tossed and turned, lesson learned
you was my first girlfriend
bridges burned, all across the board
destroyed, but what for?


when i get signed, homie, i'ma act a fool
hit the dance floor, strobe lights in the room
snatch your little secretary bitch for the homies
blue-eyed devil with a fat-ass monkey
i'ma buy a brand new caddy on vogues
trunk the hood up, two times, deuce-four
platinum on everythin', platinum on weddin' ring
married to the game and a bad bitch chose
when i get signed, homie, i'ma buy a strap
straight from the cia, set it on my lap
take a few m-16s to the hood
pass 'em all out on the block, what's good?
i'ma put the compton swap meet by the white house
republican run up, get socked out
hit the press with a cuban link on my neck
uneducated, but i got a million-dollar check like that

at first, i did love you (love you)
but now i just wanna fuck (i just wanna fuck)
late nights thinkin' of you (of you)
until i get my nut ('til i get my nut)
tossed and turned, lesson learned
you was my first girlfriend
bridges burned, all across the board (across the board)
destroyed, but what for?

what you want you? a house or a car?
forty acres and a mule, a piano, a guitar?
anythin', see, my name is uncle sam, i'm your dog
motherfucker, you can live at the mall
i know your kind (that's why i'm kind)
don't have receipts (oh, man, that's fine)
pay me later, wear those gators
cliché? then say, "fuck your haters"
i can see the baller in you, i can see the dollar in you
little white lies, but it's no white-collar in you
but it's whatever though because i'm still followin' you
because you make me live forever, baby
count it all together, baby
then hit the register and make me feel better, baby
your horoscope is a gemini, two sides
so you better cop everything two times
two coupes, two chains, two c-notes
too much ain't enough, both we know
christmas, tell 'em what's on your wish list
get it all, you deserve it, kendrick
and when you hit the white house, do you
but remember, you ain't pass economics in school
and everything you buy, taxes will deny
i'll wesley snipe your ass before thirty-five


yeah, lookin' down, it's quite a drop (it's quite a drop, drop, drop)
lookin' good when you're on top (we’re on top together)
you got a medal for us
leavin' metaphors metaphysically in a state of euphoria
look both ways before you cross my mind



study long, study wrong, nigga
hey, y'all close that front door, y'all let flies in this motherfucker
close that door!
my og up in this motherfucker right now
my pops man with the bottle of hennessy in his hand, actin' a fool
hey, hey, babe, check it out, i'ma tell you what my mama had said, she like:

i could spot you a mile away
i could see your insecurities written all on your face
so predictable your words, i know what you gonna say
who you foolin'? oh, you assuming you can just come and hang
with the homies but your level of realness ain't the same
circus acts only attract those that entertain
small talk, we know that it's all talk
we live in the laugh factory every time they mention your name

you ain't gotta lie to kick it, my nigga
you ain't gotta lie, you ain't gotta lie
you ain't gotta lie to kick it, my nigga
you ain't gotta try so hard
you ain't gotta lie to kick it, my nigga
you ain't gotta lie, you ain't gotta lie
you ain't gotta lie to kick it, my nigga
you ain't gotta try so hard

and the world don't respect you
and the culture don't accept you
but you think it's all love
and the girls gon' neglect you once your parody is done
reputation can't protect you if you never had one
jealousy (complex), emotional (complex)
self-pity (complex), under oath (complex)
the loudest one in the room, nigga, that's a complex
let me put it back in proper context

you ain't gotta lie to kick it, my nigga
you ain't gotta lie, you ain't gotta lie
you ain't gotta lie to kick it, my nigga
you ain't gotta try so hard
you ain't gotta lie to kick it, my nigga
you ain't gotta lie, you ain't gotta lie
you ain't gotta lie to kick it, my nigga
you ain't gotta try so hard


what do you got to offer?
tell me before we off ya, put you deep in the coffin
been allergic to talkin', been a virgin to bullshit
and sell a dream in the auction, tell me just who your boss is
niggas be fugazi, bitches be fugazi
this is for fugazi
niggas and bitches who make habitual lyin' babies
bless them little hearts
you can never persuade me
you can never relate me to him, to her, or that to them
or you, the truth you love to bend
in the back, in the bed, on the floor, that's your ho
on the couch, in the mouth, i'll be out, really though
see, loud, rich niggas got low money
and loud, broke niggas got no money
the irony behind it is so funny
and i seen it all this past year
pass on some advice we feel:


you ain't gotta lie to kick it, my nigga
you ain't gotta lie, you ain't gotta lie
you ain't gotta lie to kick it, my nigga
you ain't gotta try so hard
you ain't gotta lie to kick it, my nigga
you ain't gotta lie, you ain't gotta lie
you ain't gotta lie to kick it, my nigga
you ain't gotta try so hard
