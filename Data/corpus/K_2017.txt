yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, soldier’s dna (i’m a soldier's dna)
born inside the beast, my expertise checked out in second grade
when i was 9, on cell, motel, we didn’t have nowhere to stay
at 29, i've done so well, hit cartwheel in my estate
and i'm gon' shine like i’m supposed to, antisocial extrovert
and excellent mean the extra work
and absentness what the fuck you heard
and pessimists never struck my nerve
and nazareth gonna plead his case
the reason my power's here on earth
salute the truth, when the prophet say


i-i got loyalty, got royalty inside my dna
this is why i say that hip hop has done more damage to young african americans than racism in recent years
i-i got loyalty, got royalty inside my dna
i live a better life, i'm rollin' several dice, fuck your life
i-i got loyalty, got royalty inside my dna
i live a be-, fuck your life
five, four, three, two, one
this is my heritage, all i'm inheritin'
money and power, the mecca of marriages

tell me somethin'
you mothafuckas can't tell me nothin'
i'd rather die than to listen to you
my dna not for imitation
your dna an abomination
this how it is when you in the matrix
dodgin' bullets, reapin' what you sow
and stackin' up the footage, livin' on the go
and sleepin' in a villa
sippin' from a grammy, walkin' in the buildin'
diamond in the ceilin', marble on the floors
beach inside the window, peekin' out the window
baby in the pool, godfather goals
only lord knows i've been goin' hammer
dodgin' paparazzi, freakin' through the cameras
eat at four daughters, brock wearin' sandals
yoga on a monday, stretchin' to nirvana
watchin' all the snakes, curvin' all the fakes
phone never on, i don't conversate
i don't compromise, i just penetrate
sex, money, murder—these are the breaks
these are the times, level number nine
look up in the sky, ten is on the way
sentence on the way, killings on the way
motherfucker, i got winners on the way
you ain't shit without a body on your belt
you ain't shit without a ticket on your plate
you ain't sick enough to pull it on yourself
you ain't rich enough to hit the lot and skate
tell me when destruction gonna be my fate
gonna be your fate, gonna be our faith
peace to the world, let it rotate
sex, money, murder—our dna



oh, lamar
hail mary and marijuana, times is hard
pray with the hooligans, shadows all in the dark
fellowship with demons and relatives, i'm a star
life is one funny ma'fucker
a true comedian, you gotta love him, you gotta trust him
i might be buggin', infomercials and no sleep
introverted by my thoughts; children, listen, it gets deep
see, once upon a time inside the nickerson garden projects
the object was to process and digest poverty's dialect
adaptation inevitable: gun violence, crack spot
federal policies raid buildings and drug professionals
anthony was the oldest of seven
well-respected, calm and collected
laughin' and jokin' made life easier; hard times, mama on crack
a four-year-old tellin' his nanny he needed her
his family history: pimpin' and bangin'
he was meant to be dangerous, clocked him a grip and start slangin'
fifteen, scrapin' up his jeans with quarter pieces
even got some head from a smoker last weekend
dodged a policeman, workin' for his big homie
small-time hustler, graduated to a brick on him
ten-thousand dollars out of a project housing, that's on the daily
seen his first mill' twenty years old, had a couple of babies
had a couple of shooters, caught a murder case
fingerprints on the gun they assumin', but witnesses couldn't prove it
that was back when he turned his back and they killed his cousin
he beat the case and went back to hustlin'
bird-shufflin', anthony rang
the first in the projects with the two-tone mustang, that 5.0 thing they say 5-0 came, circlin' parking lots and parking spots
and hoppin' out while harrassin' the corner blocks
crooked cops told anthony he should kick it
he brushed 'em off and walked back to the kentucky fried chicken
see, at this chicken spot, there was a light-skinned nigga that talked a lot
with a curly top and a gap in his teeth, he worked the window
his name was ducky, he came from the streets, the robert taylor homes
southside projects, chiraq, the terror dome
drove to california with a woman on him and five-hundred dollars
they had a son, hopin' that he'd see college
hustlin' on the side with a nine-to-five to freak it
cadillac seville, he'd ride his son around on weekends
three-piece special with his name on the shirt pocket
'cross the street from the projects, anthony planned to rob it
stuck up the place before, back in '84
that's when affiliation was really at gears of war
so many relatives tellin' us, sellin' us devilish works, killin' us, crime
intelligent, felonious prevalent proposition with 9's
ducky was well-aware
they robbed the manager and shot a customer last year
he figured he'd get on these niggas' good sides
free chicken every time anthony posted in line, two extra biscuits
anthony liked him and then let him slide, they didn't kill him
in fact, it look like they're the last to survive, pay attention
that one decision changed both of they lives, one curse at a time
reverse the manifest and good karma, and i'll tell you why
you take two strangers and put 'em in random predicaments
give 'em a soul, so they can make their own choices and live with it
twenty years later, them same strangers, you make 'em meet again
inside recording studios where they reapin' their benefits
then you start remindin' them about that chicken incident
whoever thought the greatest rapper would be from coincidence?
because if anthony killed ducky, top dawg could be servin' life
while i grew up without a father and die in a gunfight
*gunshot*

when i was 27, i grew accustomed to more fear
accumulated 10 times over throughout the years
my newfound life made all of me magnified
how many accolades do i need to block denial?
the shock value of my success put bolts in me
all this money, is god playin' a joke on me?
is it for the moment, and will he see me as job?
take it from me and leave me worse than i was before?
at 27, my biggest fear was losin' it all
scared to spend money, had me sleepin' from hall to hall
scared to go back to section 8 with my mama stressin'
30 shows a month and i still won't buy me no lexus
what is an advisor? somebody that's holdin' my checks
just to fuck me over and put my finances in debt?
i read a case about rihanna's accountant and wondered
how did the bad girl feel when she looked at them numbers?
the type of shit'll make me flip out and just kill somethin'
drill somethin', get ill and fill ratchets with a lil' somethin'
i practiced runnin' from fear, guess i had some good luck
at 27 years old, my biggest fear was bein' judged
how they look at me reflect on myself, my family, my city
what they say 'bout me reveal if my reputation would miss me
what they see from me would trickle down generations in time
what they hear from me would make 'em highlight my simplest lines


i'm talkin' fear, fear of losin' creativity
i'm talkin' fear, fear of missin' out on you and me
i'm talkin' fear, fear of losin' loyalty from pride
'cause my dna won't let me involve in the light of god
i'm talkin' fear, fear that my humbleness is gone
i'm talkin' fear, fear that love ain't livin' here no more
i'm talkin' fear, fear that it's wickedness or weakness
fear, whatever it is, both is distinctive
fear, what happens on earth stays on earth
and i can't take these feelings with me, so hopefully, they disperse
within fourteen tracks, carried out over wax
searchin' for resolutions until somebody get back
fear, what happens on earth stays on earth
and i can't take these feelings with me, so hopefully they disperse
within fourteen tracks, carried out over wax
wonderin' if i'm livin' through fear or livin' through rap
damn



ain't nobody prayin' for me
(ain't nobody prayin' for me)
(ain't nobody prayin' for me)
ain't nobody prayin' for me
(nobody prayin' for me)
ain't nobody prayin' for me
(ain't nobody prayin' for me)
(nobody prayin' for me)


i feel like a chip on my shoulders
i feel like i'm losin' my focus
i feel like i'm losin' my patience
i feel like my thoughts in the basement
feel like, i feel like you're miseducated
feel like i don't wanna be bothered
i feel like you may be the problem
i feel like it ain't no tomorrow, fuck the world
the world is endin', i'm done pretendin'
and fuck you if you get offended
i feel like friends been overrated
i feel like the family been fakin'
i feel like the feelings are changin'
feel like my thought of compromise is jaded
feel like you wanna scrutinize how i made it
feel like i ain't feelin' you all
feel like removin' myself, no feelings involved
i feel for you, i've been in the field for you
it's real for you, right? shit, i feel like—


ain't nobody prayin' for me
ain't nobody prayin' for me
ain't nobody prayin' for me
ain't nobody prayin'


i feel niggas been out of pocket
i feel niggas tappin' they pockets
i feel like debatin' on who the greatest can stop it
i am legend, i feel like all of y'all is peasants
i feel like all of y'all is desperate
i feel like all it take is a second to feel like
mike jordan whenever holdin' a real mic
i ain't feelin' your presence
feel like i'ma learn you a lesson
feel like only me and the music though
i feel like your feelin' ain't mutual
i feel like the enemy you should know
feel like the feelin' of no hope
the feelin' of bad dope
a quarter ounce manipulated from soap
the feelin', the feelin' of false freedom
i'll force-feed 'em the poison that fill 'em up in the prison
i feel like it's just me
look, i feel like i can't breathe
look, i feel like i can't sleep
look, i feel heartless, often off this
feelin' of fallin', of fallin' apart with
darkest hours, lost it
fillin' the void of bein' employed with ballin'
streets is talkin', fill in the blanks with coffins
fill up the banks with dollars
fill up the graves with fathers
fill up the babies with bullshit
internet blogs and pulpit, fill 'em with gossip
i feel like this gotta be the feelin' where 'pac was
the feelin' of an apocalypse happenin'
but nothin' is awkward, the feelin' won't prosper
the feelin' is toxic, i feel like i'm boxin' demons
monsters, false prophets schemin'
sponsors, industry promises
niggas, bitches, honkies, crackers, compton
church, religion, token blacks in bondage
lawsuit visits, subpoena served in concert
fuck your feelings, i mean this for imposters
i can feel it, the phoenix sure to watch us
i can feel it, the dream is more than process
i can put a regime that forms a loch ness
i can feel it, the scream that haunts all logic
i feel like sayin' somethin', i feel like takin' somethin'
i feel like skatin' off, i feel like waitin' for 'em
maybe it's too late for 'em
i feel like the whole world want me to pray for 'em
but who the fuck prayin' for me?


ain't nobody prayin' for me
who prayin' for me?
ain't nobody prayin'

i said i'm geeked and i’m fired up (fired, fire)

whatever you doing, just make it count (i need some water)
wake up in the morning, thinking 'bout money, kick your feet up
hop in the shower, put on your makeup, lace your weave up

i wake in the morning, my head spinning from the last night
both in a trance, feelings are dead—what a fast life
manager called, the lobby call is 11:30
did this before, promised myself i'd be a hour early
room full of clothes, bag full of money: call it loose change
fumbled my jewelry, 100k, i lost a new chain
hop on the bird, hit the next city for another m
take me a nap then do it again
we all woke up, tryna tune to the daily news
looking for confirmation, hoping election wasn't true
all of us worried, all of us buried, in our feelings deep
none of us married to his proposal, make us feel cheap
stale and sad, distraught and mad, tell the neighbor 'bout it—
bet they agree, parade the streets with your voice proudly
time passing, things change
reverting back to our daily programs, stuck in our ways
lust


lately, i feel like i been lusting over the fame
lately, we lust on the same routine of shame
lately (lately) lately, my lust been heightened (lately)
lately, it's all contradiction (lately, i'm not here)
lately, i lust over self (lust turn into fear)
lately, in james 4:4 says
"friend of the world is enemy of the lord"
brace yourself: lust is all yours


i need some water
something came over me
way too hot to simmer down, might as well overheat
too close to comfort

don't tell a lie on me
i won’t tell the truth 'bout you
don't tell a lie on me
i won’t tell the truth 'bout you


thirty millions later, my future favors
the legendary status of a hip-hop rhyme savior
travel round the atlas in this spaceship
candy-coated, my day shift's

pi equals three-fourteen
the devil's pie is big enough to justify the whole thing
wait up, lampin' in jamaica

i ain't sanctified enough to say that i won't shoot ya
i done vandalized the industry full circuit
the earthiest slash thirstiest nigga you know versus this
scum of a land that transcend two surfaces
the richer the poorer, the bigger the picture
the more blood pours, but—


don't tell a lie on me
i won’t tell the truth 'bout you
don't tell a lie on me
i won't tell the truth 'bout you

my fans can't wait for me to son ya punk-ass
and crush ya whole lil' shit
i'll big pun ya punk-ass, you a scared lil' bitch
tiptoein' around my name, nigga, you lame
and when i get at you, homie
don't you just tell me you was just playin'
"oh, i was just playin', k-dot
c'mon, you know a nigga rock witchu, bro"
shut the fuck up, you sound like the last nigga i know
might end up like the last nigga i know
oh, you don't wanna clash? nigga, i know
i put my foot on the gas, head on the floor
hoppin' out before the vehicle crash, i'm on a roll
yellin', "one, two, three, four, five
i am the greatest rapper alive"
so damn great, motherfucker, i've died
what you hearin' now is a paranormal vibe
house on the hill, house on the beach, nigga (facts)
a condo in compton, i'm still in reach, nigga (facts)
i'm fresh out the water, i'm 'bout to breach, nigga
the five-foot giant woke up out of his sleep, nigga
oh yeah, oh yeah, mo' cars, mo' lears
mo' bars, no peers, no scars, no fear—fuck y'all, sincere
i heard the whispers, i curved the whispers
you know what the risk is
earthed in ditches, your body revertin' to stiffness
the whole world gone mad
bodies is addin' up, market's about to crash
niggas is fake rich, bitches is fake bad
blacks that act white, whites that do the dab
donald trump is a chump
know how we feel, punk—tell him that god comin'
and russia need a replay button, y'all up to somethin'
electorial votes look like memorial votes
but america's truth ain't ignorin' the votes
it's blasphemy, how many gon' blast for me?
i prophesized on my last song, you laughed at me
but when the shit get brackin', don't you ask for me
how many leaders gon' tell you the truth after me?
g malone, big bro, kudos to him
i was two o's from a m, tryna be big as em
thirty millions later, my future favors
the legendary status of a hip-hop rhyme savior
salmon and capers, fame and lawsuits
you lookin' at me in chucks, i'm lookin' at y'all suits
me and top dawg playin' rock-paper-scissors in court
a real hustler lose money just to go get some more
i said it's like that, dropped one classic, came right back
'nother classic, right back
my next album, the whole industry on a ice pack
with toc, you see the flames
in my e-y-e's—it's not a game
and the whole world is goin' mad, daddy, it's sad, daddy
my only advice? go and get you a bag, daddy
lee baca on trial tryna portray a boxer
beatin' up on my niggas while the co's watch him
tables turned, lesson learned, my best look
you jumped sides on me, now you 'bout to meet westbrook
go celebrate witcha team and let victory vouch you
just know, the next game played i might slap the shit out you
technical foul, i'm flagrant, i'm foul
they throwin' me out, you throw in the towel
look at the crowd, they— (naw, i don't like that)
look at my smile, i'm smirkin'
calm but urgent (that ain't the style, fuck!)
so many verses, you live in denial (fuck!)
so many verses, i never run out (what?)
you makin' him nervous, the music is loud
ho, jay-z hall of fame, sit yo' punk-ass down!
(sit yo punk-ass down)
so that means you ain't bigger than rapping (what else?)
so that means no more playin' the back scenes (what else?)
my spot is solidified if you ask me (what else?)
my name is identified as "that king"
i'll let y'all worry 'bout a list, i'm on some other shit
a difference between accomplishments and astonishments
you know what time it is, ante up, this is in forever
y'all got 'til april the 7th to get y'all shit together


let's get it!
look, look!
on foenem

throw a steak off the ark to a pool full of sharks
he'll take it
leave him in the wilderness with a sworn nemesis
he'll make it (he'll make it)
take the gratitude from him, i bet he'll show you somethin'
woah (woah)
i chip a nigga lil' bit of nothin'
i chip a nigga lil' bit of nothin'
i chip a nigga lil' bit of nothin'
i chip a nigga, then throw the blower in his lap
walk myself to the court like, "bitch, i did that!," x-rated
johnny don't wanna go to school no mo', no mo'
johnny said books ain't cool no mo' (no mo')
johnny wanna be a rapper like his big cousin
johnny caught a body yesterday out hustlin'
god bless america, you know we all love him


yesterday, i got a call, like, from my dawg, like 101
said they killed his only son because of insufficient funds
he was sobbin', he was mobbin', way belligerent and drunk
talkin' out his head, philosophin' on what the lord had done
he said: "k-dot, can you pray for me? it been a fucked up day for me
i know that you anointed, show me how to overcome."
he was lookin' for some closure, hopin' i could bring him closer
to the spiritual, my spirit do know better, but i told him
"i can't sugarcoat the answer for you, this is how i feel:
if somebody kill my son, that mean somebody gettin' killed."
tell me what you do for love, loyalty, and passion of
all the memories collected, moments you could never touch
i wait in front a nigga's spot and watch him hit his block
i catch a nigga leavin' service if that's all i got
i chip a nigga, then throw the blower in his lap
walk myself to the court like, "bitch, i did that!"
ain't no black power when your baby killed by a coward
i can't even keep the peace, don't you fuck with one of ours
it be murder in the street, it be bodies in the hour
ghetto bird be on the street, paramedics on the dial
let somebody touch my momma, touch my sister, touch my woman
touch my daddy, touch my niece, touch my nephew, touch my brother
you should chip a nigga, then throw the blower in his lap
matter fact, i'm 'bout to speak at this convention, call you back—


hail mary, jesus and joseph
the great american flag is wrapped and dragged with explosives
compulsive disorder, sons and daughters
barricaded blocks and borders—look what you taught us
it's murder on my street, your street, back streets, wall street
corporate offices, banks, employees, and bosses with
homicidal thoughts; donald trump's in office
we lost barack and promised to never doubt him again
but is america honest, or do we bask in sin?
pass the gin, i mix it with american blood
then bash him in, you crippin' or you married to blood?
i'll ask again—oops, accident
it's nasty when you set us up then roll the dice, then bet us up
you overnight the big rifles, then tell fox to be scared of us
gang members or terrorists, et cetera, et cetera
america's reflections of me, that's what a mirror does
