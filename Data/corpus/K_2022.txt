heart plays in ways the mind can't figure out
this is how we conceptualize human beings


my auntie is a man now
i think i'm old enough to understand now
drinking paul masson with her hat turned backwards
motorola pager, off-white guess jacket
blue air max's, gold chains, and curl kits
'93 nissan wax job, the earliest
big social, big personality, vocal
played the underground verbatim and stayed local
my auntie is a man now
i watch him and his girl hold their hands down
tip of the avenues under street lights made his
thinking, "i want me a bad bitch when i get big"
they hug on the corner like california king
cold hand all up her skirt, cars whistling down the road
see, my auntie is a man now, slight bravado
scratching the likes from lotto
hoping that she pull up tomorrow
so i can hang out in the front seat
six-by-nines keeping the music up under me
my auntie is a man now
asked my momma why my uncles don't like him that much
and at the parties why they always wanna fight him that much
she said, "ain't no tellin'
niggas always been jealous because he had more women
more money and more attention made more envy
calling him anything but broke was less offending"


my auntie is a man now
i think i'm old enough to understand now
drinking paul masson with her hat turned backwards
back when it was comedic relief to say, "faggot"
"faggot, faggot, faggot," we ain't know no better
elementary kids with no filter, however
my auntie became a man and i took pride in it
she wasn't gay, she ate pussy, and that was the difference
that's what i told my friends in second grade
she picking me up from school, they stare at her in the face
they couldn't comprehend what i grew accustomed
we pull off bumpin' quik like it was nothing
my auntie is a man now, what a relationship
i grew up fast, i needed no one to babysit
he gave me some cash then gave me some game
cherry freshener on the dash, i never complained
she even cut my hair at the pad, was loving my fade
the first person i seen write a rap
that's when my life had changed
house full of demo, smoke stuck on the window
cameras on the microphone, all women and men know
my auntie was a man now, we cool with it
the history had trickled down and made us ign'ant
my favorite cousin said he's returning the favor
and following my auntie with the same behavior


demetrius is mary-ann now
he's more confident to live his plan now (talking to the world's gonna bring you down)
but the family in disbelief this time (talking to the world's gonna bring you down)
convincing themselves, "he ain't living discreet, he's fine" (talking to the world's gonna bring you down)
they said they never seen it in him, but i seen it (ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)
the barbie dolls played off reflection of venus (ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)
he built a wall so tall you couldn't climb over
he didn't laugh as hard when the kids start joking (ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)
"faggot, faggot, faggot," we ain't know no better
middle school kids with no filter, however
i had to be very mindful of my good cousin
i knew exactly who he was, but i still loved him
demetrius is mary-ann now
i mean he's really mary-ann, even took things further
changed his gender before bruce jenner was certain
living his truth even if it meant see a surgeon
we didn't talk for a while, he seemed more distant
wasn't comfortable around me, everything was offensive
but i recall we both had a sick sense of humor
made raw, but time changes all


demetrius is mary-ann now
remember church, easter sunday?
i sat in the pew, you had stronger faith
more spiritual when these dudes were living life straight
which i found ironic 'cause the pastor didn't see him the same
he said my cousin was going through some things
he promised the world we living in was an act on abomination
and demetrius was to blame
i knew you was conflicted by the feelings of preacherman
wondering if god still call you a decent man
still, you found the courage to be subservient just to anoint
until he singled you out to prove his point, saying
"demetrius is mary-ann now
church, his auntie is a man now," it hurt
you the most 'cause your belief was close to his words
forcing me to stand now
i said, "mr. preacherman, should we love thy neighbor?
the laws of the land or the heart, what's greater?
i recognize the study she was taught since birth
but that don't justify the feelings that my cousin preserved"
the building was thinking out loud, bad angel
that's when you looked at me and smiled, said, "thank you"
the day i chose humanity over religion
the family got closer, it was all forgiven
i said them f-bombs, i ain't know any better
mistakenly, i ain't think that you'd know any different
see, i was taught words was nothing more than a sound
if ever they was pronounced without any intentions
the very second you challenged the shit i was kicking
reminded me about a show i did out the city
that time i brung a fan on stage to rap
but disapproved the word that she couldn't say with me
you said, "kendrick, ain't no room for contradiction
to truly understand love, switch position
'faggot, faggot, faggot,' we can say it together
but only if you let a white girl say 'nigga'"

one of these lives, i'ma make things right
with the wrongs i've done, that's when i unite
with the father, son, 'til then, i fight
rain on me, put the blame on me
got guilt, got hurt, got shame on me
got six magazines that's aimed at me
done every magazine, what's fame to me?
(and i'm tripping and falling)
it's a game to me, where the bedroom at?
sleep, i ain't nevеr had affairs with that
what's fair when the hearts and thе words don't reach?
what's fair when the money don't take things back?
it's rare when somebody take your dreams back
(and i'm tripping and falling)
i care too much, wanna share too much, in my head too much
i shut down too, i ain't there too much
i'm a complex soul, they layered me up
then broke me down, and morality's dust, i lack in trust
(and i'm tripping and falling)
this time around, i trust myself
please everybody else but myself
all else fails, i was myself
outdone fear, outdone myself
this year, you better one yourself
(and i'm tripping and falling)
masks on the babies, mask on an opp
wear masks in the neighborhood stores you shop
but a mask won't hide who you are inside
look around, the reality's carved in lies
wipe my ego, dodge my pride
(and i'm tripping and falling)
look myself in the mirror
amityville, ain't seen nothin' scarier
i fought like a pitbull terrier
blood i shed could fill up aquariums
tell all my angels, "carry 'em"
(and i'm tripping and falling)
every emotion been deprived
even my strong points couldn't survive
if i didn't learn to love myself, forgive myself a hundred times, dawg


i love when you count me out (huh)
i love when you count me out
i love when you count me out
(wah, woo, wah, woo, wah)
i love when you count me out
fuck it up, fuck it up, fuck it up, fuck it up, fuckin' it up
how you gon' win my trust when the lies run deep? (wah, woo, wah)
how you gon' bend your love when the bad don't sleep? (sheesh)
beep, beep, crash our feelings in the middle of the street (vroom, vroom)


fuck it up, fuck it up, fuck it up, fuck it up, fuckin' it up (huh, huh)


when you was at your lowest, tell me where the hoes was at?
when you was at your lowest, tell me where the bros was at?

call 9-1-1, i caught a body
sun up now, and yesterday is fadin'
healing's only 'bout a mile away
let me tell you 'bout the woman i know (that's my baby)
i know karma like to follow us strong (sheesh)
i know millionaires that feel alone (sheesh)
anytime i couldn't find god, i still could find myself through a song
many find they life in a phone


fuck it up, fuck it up, fuck it up, fuck it up, fuckin' it up


you said i'd feel better if i just worked hard without liftin' my head up
that left me fed up
you made me worry
i wanted my best version, but you ignored me
then changed the story, then changed the story
good energy in the room, drop the location, please
antibiotic for the womb when i'm frustrated, please
(antibiotic for the womb when i'm frustrated)
tryna keep my good conscience in rotation
thoughts in my head, they livin' there with no— (tryna keep my good)
i made a decision, never give you my feelings
fuck with you from, fuck with you from a distance
some put it on the devil when they fall short
i put it on my ego, lord of all lords
sometimes i fall for her, dawg


i love when you count me out
i love when you count me out (sheesh)
i love when you count me out (sheesh)

my name is in your mouth

miss regrets, i believe that you done me wrong (miss regrets)
miss regrets, can you please exit out my home? (miss regrets)
miss regret, i think i'm better off alone (miss regrets)
(miss regret) miss regret, i got these deep regrets
(and i'm tripping and falling)
some things i can't forget
lord knows, i tried my best
you said it's not my best
i came up out my flesh
something's up, must confess (ah, ya)
(and i'm tripping and falling)
spoke my truth, paid my debt (ah, ya)
can't you see i'm a wreck? (ah, ya)
let me loose, i digress (ah, ya)
this is me, and i'm blessed (ah, ya)
this is me, and i'm blessed (ah, ya)
this is me, and i'm blessed (ah, ya)
this is me, and i'm blessed (ah, ya)
anybody fightin' through the stress? (ah, ya)
anybody fightin' through the—?

you walk around like everything is in control
favor come with favors and you can't say no
go out the way to make the coin available
that's what i call love
the closest ones afraid to say they need some time
the turnaround is life or death, but you don't mind
go out the way to say you made the compromise
that's what i call love


but the time it'll come to not be there when somebody needs you
you say no and all you've done gives them amnesia
one thing i've learned, love can change with thе seasons


and i can't please еverybody
no, i can't please everybody
wait, you can't please everybody
no, i can't please everybody
i can't please everybody


they idolize and praise your name across the nation
tap the feet and nod the head for confirmation
promise that you keep the music in rotation
that's what i call love (that's what i call love)


but the time it'll come (but the time it'll come)
to not be there when somebody needs you (when somebody needs you)
you say no and all you've done gives them amnesia (they don't remember)

you never knew a love-love-love, a love like this
sophisticated gangsta, watch me thug like this
snatch your bitch in the club like this
seven zeros, need my pub like this
stuck in a rock and a hard place, i am
thinking i wouldn't fuck y’all up, well, i am
i gotta get my shit off
my style come from devin the dude, kurupt too
and james brown with his fist tossed
i fluctuate through vocals likе prince rogers
who evеr thought a billionaire come out of compton?
multiply simple logic, you can do it, nigga, stop it
dre ain't motivation, i don't know who is
gift and a curse, maybe them shoes is too big
or maybe i’m too pessimistic to know i'm gifted
chasing hoodrat brownie points and bullshitting
i lock the door on em, scrape and hopped a fo' on em
drain my cock and po' on em
yeah nigga, i'm still talking that whooptie whoop
hoppin' out on my enemy, i know who to shoot


and everything you do
lover, lover, lover, lover, lover for you
and everything you do
lover, lover, lover, lover, lover for you


back with my niggas where i need to be
such a familiar scenery, i smelled the gun smoke
i watched the homie watch his son smoke
i watched the sun set on my set
i seen one 'ru and one loc
one slipping, one played 'em close
everything’s fucked up nowadays
compton crip card kill each other faster than the opposite color
niggas wack out everything, your dead homies, your mother, your newborn brother
if god was a loc, he’d prolly have one coming
damn, that's fucked up
that’s how it is when you can't trust not a soul inside these streets
i made a video out there in cape town so the homie can see
to let him know it's more than just parmalee
he said, "good luck", and paused the video the moment his phone ring
that fast dollar was his only problem
no matter how many flicks of tabletop mountain
the block was home and africa was too far for power
then i knew


and everything you do
lover, lover, lover, lover, lover for you
and everything you do
lover, lover, lover, lover, lover for you


i promised dave i'd never say the phrase "fuck nigga"
he said, "think about what you saying: "fuck niggas"
no better than samuel l. on the django
no better than a white man with slave boats"
sound like i needed some soul searching
taz arnold gave me some game in real person
retraced my steps on what they never taught me
did my homework fast before government caught me
so i’ma dedicate my last verse to oprah
on how the infamous, ignorant n-word control us
so many artists gave her an explanation to hold us
well, this is my explanation straight from ethiopia
n-e-g-u-s definition: royalty; king royalty, oprah, listen
n-e-g-u-s description: black emperor, king, ruler, now let me finish
the history books overlook the word and hide it
america tried to make it to a house divided
the homies don't recognize we been using it wrong
so i'ma break it down and put this game in a song
n-e-g-u-s, say it with me, or say no more
'lluminati can come and get me
calling for oprah winfrey, all debates aside
kendrick lamar, by far, realest nigga alive

shit, everybody stupid
yeah, well, you need to talk to somebody
reach out to eckhart


i come from a generation of home invasions and i got daddy issues, that's on me
everything them four walls had taught me, made habits bury deep
that man knew a lot, but not enough to keep me past them streets
my life is a plot, twisted from directions that i can't see
daddy issues ball across my head, told me, "fuck a foul"
i'm teary-eyed, wanna throw my hands, i won't think out loud
a foolish pride, if i lose again, won't go in the house
i stayed outside, laughin' with my friends, they don't know my lifе
daddy issues made me lеarn losses, i don't take those well
momma said, "that boy is exhausted," he said, "go fuck yourself
if he give up now, that's gon' cost him, life's a bitch
you could be a bitch or step out the margin," i got up quick
i'm chargin' baskets and falling backwards, tryna keep balance
oh, this the part where mental stability meets talent
oh, this the part, he breaks my humility just for practice
tactics we learned together, sore losers forever, daddy issues


i got daddy issues, that's on me
lookin' for, "i love you", rarely empathizin' for my relief
a child that grew accustomed, jumping up when i scraped my knee
'cause if i cried about it, he'd surely tell me not to be weak
daddy issues, hid my emotions, never expressed myself
men should never show feelings, being sensitive never helped
his momma died, i asked him why he goin' back to work so soon?
his first reply was, "son, that's life, and bills got no silver spoon"
daddy issues, fuck everybody, go get your money, son
protect yourself, trust nobody, only your momma'n'em
this made relationships seem cloudy, never attached to none
so if you took some likings around me, i might reject the love
daddy issues kept me competitive, that's a fact, nigga
i don't give a fuck what's the narrative, i am that nigga
when kanye got back with drake, i was slightly confused
guess i'm not mature as i think, got some healin' to do
egotistic, zero-given fucks and to be specific (ah)
need assistance with the way i was brought up (ah, ah)
what's the difference when your heart is made of stone
and your mind is made of gold
and your tongue is made of sword, but it may weaken your soul?
my niggas ain't got no daddy, grow up overcompensatin'
learn shit 'bout bein' a man and disguise it as bein' gangsta
i love my father for tellin' me to take off the gloves
'cause everything he didn't want was everything i was
and to my partners that figured it out without a father
i salute you, may your blessings be neutral to your toddlers
it's crucial, they can't stop us if we see the mistakes
'til then, let's give the women a break, grown men with daddy issues



i'm sensitive, i feel everything, i feel everybody
one man standin' on two words, heal everybody
transformation, then reciprocation, karma must return
heal myself, secrets that i hide, buried in these words
death threats, ego must die, but i let it purge
pacify, broken pieces of me, it was all a blur
mother cried, put they hands on her, it was family ties
i heard it all, i should've grabbed a gun, but i was only five
i still feel it weighin' on my heart, my first tough decision
in the shadows clingin' to my soul as my only critic
where's my faith? told you i was christian, but just not today
i transformed, prayin' to the trees, god is taking shape
my mother's mother followed me for years in her afterlife
starin' at me on back of some buses, i wake up at night
loved her dearly, traded in my tears for a range rover
transformation, you ain't felt grief 'til you felt it sober


i remember lookin' in the mirror knowin' i was gifted
only child, me for seven years, everything for christmas
family ties, they accused my cousin, "did he touch you, kendrick?"
never lied, but no one believed me when i said "he didn't"
frozen moments, still holdin' on it, hard to trust myself
i started rhymin', copin' mechanisms to lift up myself
talked to my lawyer, told me not to be so hard on myself
he has an aura, i hope to achieve, if i find some help
congratulations, made it to be famous, still i feel uneasy
water watchin', live my life in nature, only thing relieves me
spirit guide whisper in my ear, tell me that she sees me
"did he touch you?" i said "no" again, still they didn't believe me
mother’s brother said he got revenge for my mother’s face
black and blue, the image of my queen that i can't erase
'til this day can't look her in the eyes, pain is takin' over
blame myself, you never felt guilt 'til you felt it sober


i was never high, i was never drunk, never out my mind
i need control, they handed me some smoke, but still i declined
i did it sober sittin' with myself, i went through all emotions
no dependents, except for one, let me bring you closer
intoxicated, there's a lustful nature that i failed to mention
insecurities that i project, sleepin' with other women
whitney's hurt, the purest soul i know, i found her in the kitchen
askin' god, "where did i lose myself? and can it be forgiven?"
broke me down, she looked me in my eyes, "is there an addiction?"
i said "no," but this time i lied, i knew that i can't fix it
pure soul, even in her pain, know she cared for me
gave me a number, said she recommended some therapy
i asked my momma why she didn't believe me when i told her "no"
i never knew she was violated in chicago, i'm sympathetic
told me that she feared it happened to me, for my protection
though it never happened, she wouldn't agree
now i'm affected, twenty years later trauma has resurfaced
amplified as i write this song, i shiver 'cause i'm nervous
i was five, questioning myself, 'lone for many years
nothing's wrong, just results on how them questions made me feel
i made it home, seven years of tour, chasin' manhood
but whitney's gone, by time you hear this song, she did all she could
all those women gave me superpowers, what i thought i lacked
i pray our children don't inherit me and feelings i attract
a conversation not bein' addressed in black families
the devastation, hauntin' generations and humanity
they raped our mothers, then they raped our sisters
then they made us watch, then made us rape each other
psychotic torture between our lives we ain't recovered
still livin' as victims in the public eyes who pledge allegiance
every other brother has been compromised
i know the secrets, every other rapper sexually abused
i see 'em daily buryin' they pain in chains and tattoos
so listen close before you start to pass judgement on how he move
learn how he cope, whenever his uncle had to walk him from school
his anger grows deep in misogyny
this is post-traumatic black families and a sodomy, today is still active
so i set free myself from all the guilt that i thought i made
so i set free my mother all the hurt that she titled shame
so i set free my cousin, chaotic for my mother's pain
i hope hykeem made you proud 'cause you ain't die in vain
so i set free the power of whitney, may she heal us all
so i set free our children, may good karma keep them with god
so i set free the hearts filled with hatred, keep our bodies sacred
as i set free all you abusers, this is transformation

ask whitney, she okay, never mind a hundred k
why you lyin' on benjamin? he turnin' in his grave
i'd be lyin' if i said i wouldn't give this shit away
the aloof buddha, i'm christ with a shooter
praise to muhammad, i might nigga noose ya
ap, michael friedman, my friends cooler
primary, so the resale value stupid
i would never live my life on a computer
ig'll get you life for a chikabooya
more power to ya, love 'em from a distance
why you always in the mirror more than the bitches?
and my cousin tried to sue me like he got the privilege
but i didn't lose sleep 'cause i got the spirit, ayy (ooh)


rich nigga, broke phone (ah)
tryna keep the balance, i'm stayin' strong (ooh)
stop playin' with me 'fore i turn you to a song (yeah)

ayy, peacemaker, but i'm not naive, brother

i'm fasting four days out the week, brother
i pray to god that you realize the entourage is dead
i pray to god that you not lackin' when you off the meds
i pray to god she know them cabo trips don't last forever

i pray to god you actually pray when somebody dies
thoughts and prayers, way better off timelines
false claimin' not cute, i'm mortified
the new earth in hot pursuit, two-hundred lives

bitch, i'm attractive (ah, ah, ah, ah)

as i get a little older, i realize life is perspective
and my perspective may differ from yours
i wanna say thank you to everyone that's been down with me
all my fans, all my beautiful fans
anyone who's ever gave me a listen, all my people


i come from a generation of pain, where murder is minor
rebellious and margielas'll chip you for designer
belt buckles and clout, overzealous if prone to violence
make the wrong turn, be it will or the wheel alignment
residue burned, mist of the inner-city
miscommunication to keep homi' detective busy
no protection is risky
desensitized, i vandalized pain, covered up and camouflaged
get used to hearin' arsenal rain
analyze, risk your life, take the charge
homies done fucked your baby mama once you hit the yard
that's culture
twenty-three hour lockdown, then somebody called
said your lil' nephew was shot down, the culture's involved
i done seen niggas do seventeen, hit the halfway house
get out and get his brains blown out, lookin' to buy some weed
car wash is played out, new gofundme accounts'll proceed
a brand-new victim'll shatter those dreams
the culture


(i want, i want, i want, i want)
but i want you to want me too (i want, i want, i want, i want)
i want the hood to want me back (i want, i want, i want, i want)
i want the hood
look what i done for you (look what i done for you)
look what i done for you


i said i do this for my culture
to let y'all know what a nigga look like in a bulletproof rover
in my mama's sofa was a doo-doo popper
hair trigger, walk up closer, ain't no photoshoppin'
friends bipolar, grab you by your pockets
no option if you froze up, always play the offense
niggas goin' to work and sellin' work, late for work
workin' late, prayin' for work, but he on paperwork
that's the culture, point the finger, promote ya
remote location, witness protection, they gon' hold ya
the streets got me fucked up, y'all can miss me
i wanna represent for us
new revolution was up and movin'
i'm in argentina wiping my tears, full of confusion
water in between us, another peer's been executed
history repeats again
make amends, then find a nigga with the same skin to do it
but that's the culture, crack a bottle
hard to deal with the pain when you're sober
by tomorrow, we forget the remains, we start over
that's the problem
our foundation was trained to accept whatever follows
dehumanized, insensitive
scrutinize the way we live for you and i
enemies shook my hand, i can promise i'll meet you
in the land where no equal is your equal
never say i ain't told ya, nah
in the land where hurt people hurt more people
fuck callin' it culture


(i want, i want, i want, i want)
but i want you to want me too (i want, i want, i want, i want)
i want the hood to want me back (i want, i want, i want, i want)
i want the hood
look what i done for you (look what i done for you)
look what i done for you


take the drums out


celebrate new life when it come back around
the purpose is in the lessons we learnin' now
sacrifice personal gain over everything
just to see the next generation better than ours
i wasn't perfect, the skin i was in had truly suffered
temptation, impatience, everything that the body nurtures
i felt the good, i felt the bad, and i felt the worry
but all-in-all, my productivity had stayed urgent
face your fears, always knew that i would make it here
where the energy is magnified and persevered
consciousness is synchronized and crystal-clear
euphoria is glorified and made his
reflectin' on my life and what i done
paid dues, made rules, change outta love
them same views made schools change curriculums
but didn't change me starin' down the barrel of the gun
should i feel resentful i didn't see my full potential?
should i feel regret about the good that i was into?
everything is everything, this ain't coincidental
i woke up that morning with more heart to give you
as i bleed through the speakers, feel my presence
to my brother, to my kids, i'm in heaven
to my mother, to my sis, i'm in heaven
to my father, to my wife, i am serious, this is heaven
to my friends, make sure you countin' them blessings
to my fans, make sure you make them investments
and to the killer that sped up my demise
i forgive you, just know your soul's in question
i seen the pain in your pupil when that trigger had squeezed
and though you did me gruesome, i was surely relieved
i completed my mission, wasn't ready to leave
but fulfilled my days, my creator was pleased
i can't stress how i love y'all
i don't need to be in flesh just to hug y'all
the memories recollect just because y'all
celebrate me with respect
the unity we protect is above all
and sam, i'll be watchin' over you
make sure my kids watch all my interviews
make sure you live out our dreams we produced
keep that genius in your brain on the move
and to my neighborhood, let the good prevail
make sure them babies and the leaders outta jail
look for salvation when troubles get real
'cause you can't help the world until you help yourself
and i can't blame the hood the day that i was killed
y'all had to see it, that's the only way to feel
and though my physical won't reap the benefits
the energy that carry on emits still
i want you
