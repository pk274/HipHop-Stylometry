paintin' pictures, put me in the louvre, that's a definite
universal shift, i'm in a groove
and celebrity do not mean integrity, you fool
i'm a good man, shake your hand, firm grip rule
seventy-two wins, lost ten, ballin' with the flu
more than two m's for a show, but add another two
hmm, lil' man-man, the big mans
the gt dyno flippin' the kickstand, ooh


rich nigga, broke phone (ah)

the morality can wait, feedback on low latency, i'm glitching from the face
as my thoughts grow sacredly, i'm runnin' out of space
ask whitney, she okay, never mind a hundred k
why you lyin' on benjamin? he turnin' in his grave
i'd be lyin' if i said i wouldn't give this shit away
the aloof buddha, i'm christ with a shooter
praise to muhammad, i might nigga noose ya

primary, so the resale value stupid
i would never live my life on a computer
ig'll get you life for a chikabooya
more power to ya, love 'em from a distance
why you always in the mirror more than the bitches?
and my cousin tried to sue me like he got the privilege
but i didn't lose sleep 'cause i got the spirit, ayy (ooh)

i'm fasting four days out the week, brother
i pray to god that you realize the entourage is dead
i pray to god that you not lackin' when you off the meds
i pray to god she know them cabo trips don't last forever

i pray to god you actually pray when somebody dies
thoughts and prayers, way better off timelines
false claimin' not cute, i'm mortified
the new earth in hot pursuit, two-hundred lives
