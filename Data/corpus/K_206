uh, yeah, ho, this the finale
my pep talk turn into a pep rally
say she from the hood, but she live inside in the valley now
vacayed in atlanta, then she goin' back to cali (mm)
got your girl on my line, world on my line
the irony, i fuck 'em at the same damn time
she eyein' me like a nigga don't exist
girl, i know you want this dick
girl, i'm kendrick lamar (mm)
a.k.a. benz is to me just a car (mm)
that mean your friends-es need be up to par
see, my standards are pampered by threesomes tomorrow (mm)
kill 'em all, dead bodies in the hallway
don't get involved, listen what the crystal ball say
halle berry, hallelujah
holler back, i'll do ya, beast
