this, this, this
should be played at high volume
preferably in a residential
life’s a bitch, life’s a bitch
but i’mma keep the pussy wet (yep)
i’mma keep the pussy wet (yep)
i’mma keep the pussy wet (yep)
i’mma keep the pussy wet (yep)
my dick hard, her pussy wet


and i’m born with my dick in the earth
you can tell me how much am i worth
i’mma die with my heart on my sleeve
many die on their hands and their knees
and i’m takin’ whatever i need
and i’m raping the government fees
and you’re wasting your time
and i’m speaking my mind on whatever i think
and i think that i’m richard pryor
with priors of 32 fiends
and that means that i hear for higher
tell me why are you starin’ at me?
matta fact, man, your eyes is wired
you inspired by kendrick the king
maybe it’s ’cause i’m living my dream
man, i sing what i’m living about
and the words that come out of my mouth
they requires a random routine
of being organic granite
then my access is granted
to represent the shit that i conceive
and i guarantee that i’mma bring
my mind, body, soul
and i sold all these records off bein’ myself
and i wish you can do the same thing, man
it’s easier than a stripper
or tyin’ a baby shoestring, you stringing along
and really why you writing a song?
your passion for music is never in sync
no secret societies guided me to the world of unseen
and they tell me life is a bitch, who gives a shit?
you'll get relief

i’mma keep the pussy wet (yep)
i’mma keep the pussy wet (yep)
my dick hard, her pussy wet
i'mma keep the pussy wet (yep)

(hi, ho!) i came
(bye, ho!) i went
(hi, ho!) i came
(bye, ho!) i went
(hi, ho!) i came
(bye, ho!) i went
(bitch-bitch-bitch-bitch-bitch-bitch-bitch-bitch-bitch, bitch, bitch, bitch)


and i see that you envy of me
enemigos don’t prosper
better yet, they do die eventually
if i’m at the event you will leave
‘cause you know and i know that
i go ham even if muslims is seen
in my rearview i’m near you
but i don’t hear you, can you at least breathe?
with an oxygen mask, and
the masses keep saying i’m speaking for them
and if you can imagine my madness
then you can see where i’ve been
and the places the louis has been
and i swear i been doing this when
you was in pajamas, watching b-barney and friends
and you couldn’t harm me even with ten
weapons of your choice riding in
army tanks, you shot blanks
and i shot back, make your duplex bend
what the fuck you think? if i don’t think
then i’m right back where the city sin
what the fuck you drink?
thinking i can’t write these raps in the lions’ den
when i hear that you lyin’, then?
it’s murder she wrote, ain’t no hope
you go downhill, man, where’s your slope?
get thrown downhill tied to a rope
tell the world to put intervals
man, i swear this the anecdote
and they tell me that life is a bitch
who gives a shit when you know?



and i see that you envy of me
don’t prosper, better yet, they do die eventually
cause you know and i know that i go ham even if muslims is seen
in my rearview i’m near you
but i don't hear you, can you at least breathe?

(hi, ho!)
(bye, ho!)
