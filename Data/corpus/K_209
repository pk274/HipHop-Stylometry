heard a conversation with my father talking to his favorite partner
at the domino table, tony had told him that he saw a
young nigga hopping out busting like four charters
popping pills, mix a gallon of sherm and some holy water
mix a gallon of sherm and some holy water
sell it to a priest he probably can get it off by tomorrow
it's wicked when my favorite uncle kick it
fiends trying to kick the addiction of sucking glass dicks
vivid images go against any fantasy you can fathom
phantoms ain't the only thing that suicidal
open the doorway to his soul
hit the hallway then hit the closet you see a rifle
aim it at your arteries, pardon me, parts of me is pyscho
in retrospect my respect was a power ranger high note
tumbling backwards into a karate kicking high note
my innocence would eventually see a hindrance
surrenduring ninja turtles, pizza and sega genesis
heard it over my bunk bed ear hustling
something my papa said that caught my attention
his eyes red he's smoking on marijuana mixing the two eleven
he said i'm seven going on sixty-seven
the day i turned seventeen is the day that a lesson inside my lifetime
come across a clothes line, every stick is a co-sign
everything in the streets got the power to make me go blind
even if he sat me down in the sun and gave me those eyes
comprehend it well and i could smell the soberness evaporating by itself
he said, "tony my biggest fear is to hear kendrick disappeared in the fire out here and i didn't help
so if i can give him the game to hydroplane his decisions in life so he can go
further than the streets and remain to be on the honor roll"
sacrifice my life even if that shit, my mama though
til the day he carried by the big six, domino


backpack raps with gats in it
don't get your cap peeled by the black menace
k dot thoroughbred
move like a militant soldier
on point like a pyramid, force to be reckoned with
with the best shit
like the strongest manure, i'm ready when you are
this is it
i'm in the lab cooking up all day, eff em up all day
like a nympho, i been dope since s curl waves
trying to convince hoes i got good hair
knowing damn well there's chemicals there
i'm in the hood with the 17 year olds that's on hood patrol
and they want stripes so they shoot off bikes and you know
any moment you can lose your life so kiss your kids or hug your wife or whatnot yo
i spawned with a dragon
he tried to throw his flame but i ducked and i stabbed him
came out the battle laughing
that's a metaphor for any rapper who want it
i smack em 'til their nose is running
you know the hoes is coming if i'm there
and the hoes is cumming once we hit that hotel
that's no assumption, cool out before i move out
hop on the 105 and do about 105 before your ass get threw out
the back seat
there's a dead guy on the freeway, oh it's not dot
tell the medics it's okay, a beast when the beat break
you probably think i'm dope like the it's the realest shit i wrote
but to me it's a throw away
i stare at them four walls and rap like i'm mad at god
nice enough, i throw a spear at nas, a jab at jay
matter fact, no, i take that back
see i don't play with real legends of rap like you do
and i'm crucial, concealed by real crips and soowoos
and they shoot, they photography students when beef get to brewing compton!
