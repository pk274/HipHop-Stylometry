'cause it got a better steering grip
young but been a man and you won't understand
spree wheels looking like a bed room ceilin' fan

rolling down rosecrans
i fear no man
i be god damned
if i live on my knees i rather die on my feet
that hub city threat shit is me


nigga, i'm from the land where fiends fly like peter pan
and the average man got a heat up in them dickie pants
i got some plans to stack riches
own 76â€²s like a philadelphian
if you don't know by now i'm focused like camera lens
and if i know your mans i might give a second chance
'cause i don't wanna hurt you, have 'em runnin' in herzels
shells stick to his back like a ninja turtle
crack sells, drug sell all in the virtue
been a artist since prince played in color purple
weed smoke, hydro blow on that purple
2 straps on my side like suspenders on urkel
i suspend you, they 'urk you, what you lyin' for?
you know you ain't eatin' like feed the children commercials
man, my children'll circle around your block
let out shots and be home thirty minutes before they curfew


when the beef start cookin'
and the shots start comin'
don't hesitate to pop that thing (right)
people start lookin'
and people start runnin'

if i live on my knees i rather die on my feet
that hub city threat shit is me (bitch)
