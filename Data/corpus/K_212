california economics got me hooked on it like phonics
when the beat drop, i drop a bomb like atomic
got my heat cocked like some type of bird
big pimpin’ weapon under the fur
limping’ like a prosthetic leg
but still play the back like bike pegs
la fitted cap, cap pealing your wig back
pack with glocks in it g roc black tinted
what side you claim fuck yo gang

yeah yeah thats what i’m talking bout nigga


five in the morning i’m up cooking it up
studio filled with coffee cups
i don’t sleep i just lay down and wink
i work like slavery was just last week
somebody told me that every label
got this button that beep and when i rap it go off
and thats when they know to push their artist's album back
i don’t allow cats around the big dogs
you can’t see me, the force between us is thick fog
i never hang up when the money calls unless it be a emergency that my family involved
don’t get your life involved, we’ll shoot without playing basketball, get your ass mopped like lysol
you light like mc, i’m heavy on the track
if you see my flow you would say its obeast
kdot/lyrical disease/jay rock
america's most wanted
please
