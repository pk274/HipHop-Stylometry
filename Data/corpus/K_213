(ahh, shit!) recognize what live inside these eyes
i'ma ride until the dead has risen
live in a project building, dodging the module ceilings
i ride, i'ma ride in a stolen jeep
ride with the eyes of five blind men, my vision (corrupted)
mama tried counseling, five plans for kendrick (but fuck it)
my family ties had sabotaged rosecrans existence (abducted)
my aliens on surveillance, they paid me a visit (disgusting)
our stadium's packed, raiders in black
curls dripping, silver bullet, palladium in my strap
i lie on the side of a one-way street (blow-blow-blow-blow!)
nowhere to go, death all i can see (blow-blow-blow-blow!)
i say "fuck is up?" i fuck 'em up
your supper's up, and something's up
i hope he no can walk the tightest rope before the double-dutch
broke plenty records with this weapon, i protect it under oath
my discretion, fuck your blessing, fuck your life, fuck your hope
fuck your mama. fuck your daddy, fuck your dead homie
fucked the world up when we came up, that's compton, homie!
