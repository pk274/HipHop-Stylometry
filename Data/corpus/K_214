kurupt, let me erupt (what)
like flammable gases under the earth’s crust (uh)
my flammable passion can get the earth crushed (what)
it’s 2012 once i unveil lyrics that can derail a train of a subway entrance
say i bust like jerome bettis and that’s a must
offended the best, magnum on my dick defending my flesh
seven holes like a clarinet
clarify your worthiness or foresee funeral services
affirmative action pop up on your furnishing
unfortunate future for us to fly free under god’s firmament
me versus whosever’s dead, that’s god’s tournament
kendrick the arthritis, hand that hates to write this
what’s good, i’m in your hood like workers of midas
purpose is to be righteous
but my malcolm x is extra’d out like a crip yelling his hood out when he fighting
i never seen a key, all i seen was a triton
i’m always kicking up dust, i’ve never been hiking
i’ve always had a licence for this hip-hop
influenced by the rap that vocally said they killed cops
i’m riding on e with a bitch that pill pop
now that’s the irony that i give you when the zip lock
bag and sell it at doo wop, after that pass the doo wop
lick a few shots for the few blocks that we on
for ain’t no beat that’s flawed or unique so please don’t try to xerox
copy written, niggas bitten
my style since i was backflipping
inside canals, la gears with the laces missing
me against the world in the background, mama had gave me bowl cut in the kitchen
big cousin became a statistic, i chose the right flows and remained consistent
voila, now they got me, haha
expectations is high, compton or bed-stuy
to them skinny niggas in the chi bumping common
but the only thing in common is crime and more violence
i play a little game, you say you fly, i’m over fly
i’m the pilot that’s left on the plane, cloud nine
that’s where i’m at with it
punchlines till your jaw dented
catapult your buick till your car spinning
