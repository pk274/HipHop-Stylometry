you’re like a needle in a haystack
i wanna sit you where my face at
lunch with a few mai tais
purple kisses on my tie
life can’t really predict love
now you’re getting this dick, love
i’m looking for you with a flashlight
i want to feel what a real fat ass like
no injection, i learned my lesson
i walk it like i talk it, baby, this pedestrian
runnin’ through your mind like jackie joyner
pussy pop like (boom!) go get me a burner
got shot like (boom!)
this can be detrimental
t-shirt and panties, that's your credential
you’re cotton candy, i need a fistful
i’m awful antsy, hope that convince you
