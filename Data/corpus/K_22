i am a sinner
who's prob'ly gonna sin again
lord, forgive me, lord, forgive me
things i don't understand
sometimes i need to be alone
bitch, don't kill my vibe, bitch, don't kill my vibe
i can feel your energy from two planets away, i got
my drink, i got my music, i would share it, but today i'm yellin'
bitch, don't kill my vibe, bitch, don't kill my vibe
bitch, don't kill my vibe, bitch, don't kill my vibe


look inside of my soul and you can find gold and maybe get rich
look inside of your soul and you can find out it never exist
i can feel the changes, i can feel a new life, i always
knew life can be dangerous, i can say that i like a challenge
and you tell me it's painless, you don't know what pain is
how can i paint this picture when the color blind is hangin' witcha?
fell on my face and awoke with a scar, another mistake livin' deep in my heart
wear it on top of my sleeve in a flick, i can admit that it did look like yours
why you resent every makin' of his? tell me your purpose is petty again
but even a small lighter can burn a bridge, even a small lighter can burn a bridge


i can feel the changes, i can feel the new people round me
just wanna be famous, you can see that my city found me
then put me on stages, to me, that's amazin'
to you, that's a quick check, with all disrespect, let me say this


i am a sinner
who's prob'ly gonna sin again
lord, forgive me, lord, forgive me
things i don't understand
sometimes i need to be alone
bitch, don't kill my vibe, bitch, don't kill my vibe
i can feel your energy from two planets away, i got
my drink, i got my music, i would share it, but today i'm yellin'
bitch, don't kill my vibe, bitch, don't kill my vibe
bitch, don't kill my vibe, bitch, don't kill my vibe


i'm tryna keep it alive and not compromise the feelin' we love
you're tryna keep it deprived and only co-sign what radio does
and i'm lookin' right past ya, we live in a world, we live in a world
on two different axles, you live in a world, you livin' behind
the mirror, i know what you're scared of, the feeling of feeling emotions inferior
this shit is vital, i know you had to, this shit is vital, i know you had to
die in a pitiful vain, tell me a watch and a chain is way more believable
give me a feasible gain, rather a seasonal name, i'll let the people know
this is somethin' you can blame on yourselves, you can remain stuck in a box
i'ma breakout and then hide every lock, i'ma breakout and then hide every lock


i can feel the changes, i can feel the new people round me
just wanna be famous, you can see that my city found me
then put me on stages, to me, that's amazin'
to you, that's a quick check, with all disrespect, let me say this


i am a sinner
who's prob'ly gonna sin again
lord, forgive me, lord, forgive me
things i don't understand
sometimes i need to be alone
bitch, don't kill my vibe, bitch, don't kill my vibe
i can feel your energy from two planets away, i got
my drink, i got my music, i would share it, but today i'm yellin'
bitch, don't kill my vibe, bitch, don't kill my vibe
bitch, don't kill my vibe, bitch, don't kill my vibe


bitch, don't kill my vibe, you ain't heard the coast
like this in a long time, don't you see that long line?
and they waitin' on kendrick like the 1st and the 15th
threes in the air, i can see you are in sync
hide your feelings, hide your feelings, now, what you better do
i'll take your girlfriend then put that pussy on the pedestal

bitch, don't kill my vibe, bitch, don't kill my vibe
walk out the door and they scream, "it's alive!"
my new year's resolution is to stop all the pollution
talk too motherfuckin' much, i got my drink, i got my music
i say, bitch, don't kill my vibe, bitch, don't kill my vibe
bitch, don't kill my vibe, bitch, don't kill my vibe
