i slay a nigga with no conscience, i'm so compton
i know your confidence, you're incompetent, that's a compliment
any continent, i can construct atomic condiments
i'm not a communist, rather govern my own accomplishments
livin' in turmoil boils my temper
tempurpedic'll burn if you sleep on me, nigga
jimmy crack corn and kendrick can crack the horns
of a dragon and toss 'em inside of a bush full of thorns
taggin' along, get you thrown on side of your lawn
throw a molotov, i toss, catch it like a baton, boss
acquire many choirs for your funeral
be quiet before i stand over you like a urinal
mark a bullet wherever your latest rapper tattoo'll go
your crew'll know i split you 'til you was two adults
siamese, i sneeze and bless tracks
you a bitch on menopause, i ain't gotta pause that
bitch
