hearts on my timeline
bullet to your rose, then i watch your petal fold
don't you know your body been mine?
i know you know i know
sexy, nasty
have no guideline
one day, four times
you don't mind that
i don't care (pleasure)
your divinity has turned me into a sinner
god is fair (pleasure)
and your beauty can even make hell have a winter


yeah
and a freak mind is divine, so we fuck from behind
on these sides, between thighs i eat up
why do i do anything but trust myself?
tried to give her up but she fuck so well
man, that bitch so cold, man, that bitch so cold
i'ma take my time, i'ma hit that slow
'cause i ain't in a rush young girl
you the only thing for me in this fucked up world
and do you believe in love?
hold on tight when demons come
it'll be alright, no need to run
stay with me tonight, we'll see the sun
and when we wake up early we'll still be young
never felt this free before, i need you more
than keys need doors, i need you sleepin' next to me
the blanket sheets, i'll take them all and keep you warm (yeah)
and i teach her that we were the creatures of love
you be the leader, i could be julius caesar
when i'm pullin' up in the bimmer
the beats in the trunk, all the freaks wanna fuck
