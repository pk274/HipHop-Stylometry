pull out the aston martin
if you talking too much pull out my coffin
pull out another one for his brother
real comfortable, even get his favourite colour
i burn rubber off the v12
i fuck international females
my last bitch bitch was speaking some german shit
catch me vacating on the germany trip
eyes red, sandals on like, fuck what cam'ron said
i'm pecking for the bread
but nothing like a pigeon
i'm something like a vulture
you wanna know how i do it mothafucka i'll coach ya
they call me phil jackson
i train your day like denzel, welcome to practice
yes i'm the baddest, if my lyrics had looks
this rhyme right here belong in the beauty pageant
j. brown asked me do i got it, been had it
this beat is pornographic
i fuck off it
