picture plenty pussies throwing pellet guns at me
paranoia make it more than difficult for me to sleep
pinnacle, i know i be, centerfold, i know i got
but they hate to frame me as the mona lisa of hip-hop
so retaliation is a must, when we bend the block
my niggas dump'n out the roof, (do-do-do-do-do)
drive past, guns blast, shooting up the charts too
uh, me k-d-o-t, put tnt inside my suit
walk inside the label, struck a match, and then i blew, bomb
c4 everywhere, c4 everywhere
i got three whores with me, it smells like dior and derri√®re
decoys die slow, you can detour to heaven's stairs
or walk inside hell's dungeon, i just might derail something
they pussies, i smell something
you douche on the daily, niggas, you pushin' up daisy
i push the gas on mercedes, nigga
came in this game with a rolie chain, and a dream
became reality, made some casualties, my choppers scream


and now we dump'n out the roof, (do-do-do-do-do)
drive past, guns blast, shooting up the charts too
uh, me k-d-o-t, put t-n-t inside my suit
uh, walk inside the label, struck a match and then i blew
and now we dump'n out the roof, (do-do-do-do-do)
drive past, guns blast, shooting up the charts too
uh, me k-d-o-t, put t-n-t inside my suit
uh, walk inside the label, struck a match and then i blew


nigga that thought good kid gon' flop, or that i might go pop
or your bitch won't drop, knees when my shit drop
y'all too infatuated with the fucking numbers
which make it easy for me to divide and conquer
i come from compton, we ain't have it all
smokers basing inside the cafeteria hall
and i'm putting fear in you all, see your skeletons shaking
jump out your body, you ricky bobby until you naked
y'all pray to god this week i be putting out bombs
i pray to god this beat is good enough for shyne
if not, j. cole, your shit is trash
but at least my opinion just made everyone laugh
this is where we at? i guess it's entertainment
i guess this is speculation making a classic came with
if i ain't have the patience i'd probably self destruct
real people want real music, the jig is up


your worst fear is confirmed
we love that you crashed and burned
the real is back
k. dot it's your turn, take your victory lap
king cole salutin' compton's own king kendrick
thats the sky is falling, the wind is calling
stand for something or die in the morning
the city hail king kendrick lamar
the world hail king kendrick lamar


and now we dump'n out the roof, (do-do-do-do-do)
drive past, guns blast, shooting up the charts too
uh, me k-d-o-t, put t-n-t inside my suit
uh, walk inside the label, struck a match and then i blew
and now we dump'n out the roof, (do-do-do-do-do)
drive past, guns blast, shooting up the charts too
uh, me k-d-o-t, put t-n-t inside my suit
uh, walk inside the label, struck a match and then i blew


this is my life and i look at it like its my last
and i'm lookin' right past the future as i reminisce on my past
and i don't even think how i used to, my mind is on rocket blast
and i don't even drink like i used too, and i don't even smoke
so you know this natural flow is for users that want to go to rehab
lookin' at the coke that he had, matter fact that followers bother them
then but i won't say my bad, see i just lay in the cut
watch the product stack up, motherfucker what what
see now we dump'n out the roof
