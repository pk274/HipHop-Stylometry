itty-bitty bitch is a numerologist
got your number where i live
i'ma get you outta pocket like a quarterback blitz
that's a everyday faucet, make it wet, make it rinse
skeletons in your closet but your past don't exist
got a pad on your list, got a pad on your lock
calabas' ain't the move, that's where everybody live
plus the mountain is hot, you forgot what you got, ah!
hol' up, nuisance (i say it, i say it, i say it)
i recommend 'em all with acoustics (i say it, i say it, i say it)
i recommend a bed for the juices (i say it, i say it, i say it)
i recommend you live where the truth is (i say it, i say it, i say it)
psychedelic views and infinity pools, yeah, checking out
once i sweat them edges out
hair down like vanity
i got the fuck-ups, i got the damage fees
i got the gold dust, i got the anesthesia
when you chose up, this ain't a fantasy
we 'bout to go up, see underhanding me never got no love
but understandin' me maybe can mold us andâ€“
