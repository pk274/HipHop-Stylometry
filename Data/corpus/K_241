reach my surroundings when i move out cause dudes envy
something like prince akeem 2 in the semi
super soak ya, anti-social, for the mail i'll go postal
postpone your post put it on pause with no controller at all
just a nickel plated fo-fo, pockets got a melody, carryin' notes
without bad breath, still carry the scope
i infrared whoever infiltrate, or disrespect, my money make it intellect, like a safety you intercept, a chain of bullets
they vics when they rubbing your chest, pincher
i treat all beef tender, no shook ones around here son
you like michael jay fox when them bad boys come
not will smith or martin lawrence, i'm talkin' 'bout boys that'll surely inspire your life insurance, life is short
your reality is at the height of a dwarf
say goodbye to the bitches and the champagne corks
say hello to the ditches where your homies is tossed, in it
porche blocks be black tinted, everything stocked
catch me running over civilians, middle finger up when i'm removing the ceiling, dissect the whole block when i'm removing your building, this goes out to every man, woman and children
i don't discriminate, shook ones get earthquaked
