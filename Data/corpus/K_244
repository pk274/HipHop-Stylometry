kkk dot bitch
damn i'm fly, ain't i bitch
don't tell me, don't smell me
since you say that i ain't shit
i be with those benjamins
like he was my sidekick
we batman and robin
welcome to our private affair
where, the narrow be right here
where, the bitches be right here
22 here, you you
won't you change your life boo
together we can slide through
midnight, murcielago, loud pipes
make sure that that head right, damn right
i be on that other shit make them want to curse my government
dayum, hate the game, hate on me
and i'm loving it
i'm bouncing with a couple models sipping on that bubbly
i'm talking 'bout them yellow bottles with that bucket under it
gone in my fast car
circle round the block twice
so they know you 
pull up in something brand new
sipping on that goosey goose
i see some haters in this room
so we tell 'em i love you
pull up in something brand new
sipping on that goosey goose
we got some haters in this room
what we tell 'em? i love you
you, make, my life complete
i wonder where would i be
if it wasn't for you


ugh, check out the denim bitch
