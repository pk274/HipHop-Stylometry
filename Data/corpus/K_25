on the dead homies
aye sounwave turn this shit up nigga
turn this shit up! soundwave, turn this shit up nigga
tell me, who the bitch nigga hatin' on me?
jumping on my dick, but this dick ain't free
to pimp a butterfly, another classic cd
ghetto lullaby for every one-day mc
(bluh! bluh! bluh! bluh!)
nigga, now r.i.p
my diligence is only meant to write your eulogy


alls my life i has to fight, nigga
alls my life i...
hard times like, "god!"
bad trips like, "yea!"
nazareth, i'm fucked up
homie, you fucked up
but if god got us
then we gon' be alright


uh, and when i wake up
i recognize you're lookin' at me for the pay cut
but homicide be lookin' at you from the face down
what mac-11 even boom with the bass down
schemin', and let me tell you 'bout my life
painkillers only put me in the twilight
where pretty pussy and benjamin is the highlight
now tell my momma i love her but this what i like, lord knows
20 of 'em in my chevy, tell 'em all to come and get me
reapin' everything i sow, so my karma come
and heaven no preliminary hearing, so my record
i'm a motherfuckin' gangster in silence for the record
tell the world i know it's too late
boys and girls, i think i gone cray
drown inside my vices all day
won't you please believe when i say

wouldn't you know
we been hurt, been down before
nigga, when our pride was low
lookin' at the world like, "where do we go?"
nigga, and we hate po-po
wanna kill us dead in the street fo sho
nigga, i'm at the preacher's door
my knees gettin' weak, and my gun might blow
but we gon' be alright


nigga, we gon' be alright
nigga, we gon' be alright
we gon' be alright
do you hear me, do you feel me? we gon' be alright
nigga, we gon' be alright
huh? we gon' be alright
nigga, we gon' be alright
do you hear me, do you feel me? we gon' be alright


what you want, you a house, you a car?
40 acres and a mule, a piano, a guitar?
anything, see my name is lucy, i'm your dog
motherfucker, you can live at the mall
i can see the evil, i can tell it, i know it's illegal
i don't think about it, i deposit every little zero
thinkin' of my partner, put the candy, paint it on the regal
diggin' in my pocket, ain't a profit big enough to feed you
everyday my logic, get another dollar just to keep you
in the presence of your chico... ah!
i don't talk about it, be about it, everyday i sequel
if i got it then you know you got it, heaven, i can reach you
pat dawg, pat dawg, pat dawg, my dog, that's all
bick back and chad, i trap the bag for y'all
i rap, i black on track so rest assured
my rights, my wrongs; i write 'til i'm right with god

wouldn't you know
we been hurt, been down before
nigga, when our pride was low
lookin' at the world like, "where do we go?"
nigga, and we hate po-po
wanna kill us dead in the street fo sho
nigga, i'm at the preacher's door
my knees gettin' weak, and my gun might blow
but we gon' be alright


nigga, we gon' be alright
nigga, we gon' be alright
we gon' be alright
do you hear me, do you feel me? we gon' be alright
nigga, we gon' be alright
huh? we gon' be alright
nigga, we gon' be alright
do you hear me, do you feel me? we gon' be alright


i keep my head up high
i cross my heart and hope to die
lovin' me is complicated
too afraid, a lot of changes
i'm alright, and you're a favorite
dark nights in my prayers
