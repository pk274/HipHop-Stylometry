yeah, yeah
young egypt
look, look

i feel like pacino in godfather, i'm charged
our father who art in heaven, kendrick at large
came in the game with a plan of beatin' the odds
what an accomplishment, broken promises
kept my focus anonymous till i dealt with the consequence
the greatest, the latest mogul, you know what time it is
you niggas fear me like y'all fear god
you sound frantic, i hear panic in your voice
just know the mechanics of making your choice in writin' your bars
before you poke out your chest, loosen your bra
before you step out of line and dance with the star
i could never end a career if it never start
the murderous capital, avenues lookin' like evil dead zombies
with batteries to the head
the flattery of watchin' my stock rise
the salary, the compensation tripled my cock size
i run through these stop signs with no brake fluid
just premium gas, do it for dolo
crash markets and prejudiced tags, look at my photo
black excellence, pessimist, die countin' my coin
hope it's evident that i inspired a thousand emcees to do better
i blew cheddar on youth centers, buildings and beamers and blue leather
forecastin' my future, this is the future
the mastermind, until my next album, more power to you
*gunshot*


come on, come on, come on, come on
come on, come on, come on, come on, come on
come on, come on, come on, come on (hell yeah), come on
come on, come on, come on, come on
come on, come on

you see, you see, you see, you see (right)
but i don't shake you down, dog for you, you, you, you, uh
they say the government ain't the truth, truth, (mhm) truth, truth
and the politicians always mislead the youth, youth, youth, youth

but head is the answer
head is the future
don't second guess yourself
come on, give me some help
hey one more time, band, i need y'all to help me out right now (hahahaha)
head is the answer (yeah)
head is the futu—it's the future, that nigga said
don't second guess yourself (crazy, holy shit, hahaha)

say come on, come on, come on, come on, come on
come on, come on—my background singer—come on, come on (right, yeah, yeah, yeah)
say, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on
come on, come on, come on, come on
