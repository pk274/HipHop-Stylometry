from compton to baltimore i'ma kill it
i buy a morgue in the minute
the public house, the plastic couch of a section 8 tenant
the regal window is tinted
the air conditioner broke
but i'm cool enough to ensure you my ride is an eskimo
(huh?) and i peel off
in the midst of gettin' my thrills off
and i thrive off energies from inner cities that we lost (huh?)
i'm puttin' the ghetto on top of my back
and i live in the back of the jungle
lions, tigers, bears, oh my
hear the siren, walk up,
