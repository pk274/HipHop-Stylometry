i'd like to thank everybody for coming out tonight
i'd like to share with you, my celebrity scenarios
i promise i won't tell baby girl
i can hold water, i promise


i got this girl named meagan good
well, you could say that meagan was bad
the way she talk dirty he done threw me the ass
like a quarterback mr. mcnabb
she introduce me to her friend teairra mari
well, see mari put a nigga to sleep
she made her boy feel good even curled my feet
now please don't go back to jay-z
it's a rap, i used to fuck with christina a while back
which one, aguilera or milian, both of em
they did this little trick with their tongue
i came faster than a nascar spinning backwards
brandi like to suck it she said she needed some practice
in the back of my bucket wasn't using no mattress
brooke valentine like to take it from behind
face down, ass up, shit i love it when she climb


now we can all be celebrity cousins
and if i fuck i swear i won't say nothin'
now we can all be celebrity cousins
and if i fuck i swear i won't say nothin' else
i promise, i won't tell nobody else
i promise, i swear i won't say nothin' else
i promise, just take off your clothes, nobody'll know
psych


and about vivica
i had her way before 50 cent start dissing her
one thing i know, shit i hope he wasn't kissing her
man she could blow like a torch
and dick without using a fork
she introduced me to gabrielle of course
union, had her on my backyard porch
legs up film rolling, action, cut
she looking at me like "what happened, get up"

now we can all be celebrity cousins
and if i fuck i swear i won't say nothin'
now we can all be celebrity cousins
and if i fuck i swear i won't say nothin' else
i promise, i won't tell nobody else

ciara gave a nigga the goodies love tonight
and bow wow wants to see my cars out the house

remember that time at my house
remember that time at your house
remember that time on the bed
remember that time on the couch
remember that time on the chair
