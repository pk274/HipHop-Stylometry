watch how k. dot move, something not like you
have your gun by you, 'cause niggas will try you

uh
who's sick as me?
tell the truth, bitch, nobody, and that's real
and as far as my eyes can see
i'm the only one fucking with me
myself, so put your album right back on the shelf
and let real business get dealt
you ladies man like leon phelps
i pee on any man tryna discontinue my health
i don't give a damn on how you feel or how you felt
your small mercy won't help
when shots circle around your waist like designer belts
i design your face, the tray hitch lift ya up
rock niggas like bobby boucher, you waterboy
what you want, weed, dope, or water, boy?
it's right here, and y'all catch up, i move fast like light years
now it's back to the basics
k. dot's nothing to play with
a nigga tried to test my gangsta
i pulled out a weapon and aced it
my grade point average at the top of the brackets
i'm sick like a cancer patient
assist many players like personal agent
y'all as foul, clothes to fragrance
i'm the best now
plus the kid married to rap, old cats need to renew ya vows
sit down, practice your verbs and nouns
'cause i'm on the verge to progressin' my words
i'm the best you heard today, hands down
so hand down whatever you had
like you been in a bag
put it in garbage or trash, i'm the best you had
ever since, oh yeah, intelligence
k. dot, so heaven sent
