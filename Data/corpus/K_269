welcome to the wild side, hub city's wild side
where tecs fly that's homicide, my stacks like a mile high
fly as a bitch, got a condo on cloud 9
slap box with god, jump off heaven and skydive
so supernatural k.dot come and see me on sci-fi
from 5-6 with five nines two mac-10s and glock nines
lets do this however whenever tell em i'm ready
waters run deep way before katrina broke the levee
look partner, i'm no gangster, i'm no killer
but please believe i know plenty gangsters that'll kill ya
i don't like you, i don't feel ya you're very unfamiliar
so please build your catalog before i knock your cattle off
this saddle off on a red horse that's a red porsche
that's not your favorite rapper in the booth
that's a dead corpse once k.dot kick chaos
niggas bitch off like canines click up and click, click, click boom
smell the fumes on my levis
bitches poppin' pills and mushrooms in my hotel rooms
i squeeze dick through their thick thighs then bounce like this beat from t.dot
six t.vs in my new suv f-u-c-k-y-o-u pay me
or pay me no attention and meet the criminal henchmen
genesis ain't shit, i know local henchmen
come shoot me i'm in a two seater with hootie, motherfucker
