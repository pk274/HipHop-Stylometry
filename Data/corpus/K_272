pillars of joy can be found
through the thought of you
i'll be troubled and bustled and scorned for your love
canei finch on the beat
turn the headphones up, ali
here we go


i woke up this morning with my dick on hard
didn't know why 'til i said fuck all y'all
or fuck this world, or i'mma fuck that girl
good kid, m.a.a.d city, watch my day unfurl
i put my life in these sentences
fucking right, it's either that or life sentences
i'm relatives with benjamin
i used to give a fuck about my luck when i was innocent
now what the fuck is up? i'm at your neck like a pendleton
nigga, i need that, bitch, i need that
twenty-four acres and a mule, best believe that
they say he got smoke, like where the weed at?
and everything you hope, bitch nigga, we that
pockets on kelly price back when it was '95
buy a strap and then we cock it back when it's uncircumcised
write a rap on how we just react when shotty hit the spine
give you dap and then we slide through your hood three dozen times
so what's good? i'm looking for a pedicure
pink pussy that pop, preferably the kind that don't stink
bomb-ass head 'til she can't blink
and her eyes get watery, you gotta pardon me


i'm so damn turnt
wheeling in a two-door with two hoes that follow me
and you know, westside, right on time, tell 'em hoes kudos
eastside, right on time, they don't fuck with you though
when my hood getting to the money, the pedal never broke
came a long way from the ghetto, dog, but
westside, right on time, only thing fosho
eastside, right on time, gunning through your door

all praise go to the most high
all fades turn into a drive-by
part ways from the streets, after fucking with police guaranteed
last nigga did that died, don't you, don't you, don't you
wanna live where the ak go for only 8k
minus six racks, minus one on top of that?
melee, stomp him out then drug him out like a date rape
daytonas bending every corner while they say

all i ever wanted was a dollar bill and hundreds
and my teacher as my woman, when she smiled, i stick my tongue in
plus some cartoons and some cereal, snoop doggy on my stereo
some british knights or la gears with glowing lights or perry ellis jacket
i would love a swapmeet full of chevrolets in candy paint
that's wet with tammy on the bumper, can i hump her? poppa tell me yes
a dpgc concert and a dj quik song on cassette
twenty years later: hi hater, i'm the fucking best
