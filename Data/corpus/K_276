if who i am offends you, don't feel sorry
don't feel, don't feel sorry, don't feel, don't feel sorry
my loss is worth more than your wins
i'm satisfied if it starts over again
that is everything, that is everything
that is everything, that is everything
that is everythingâ€”
i try to make it stop, i pray it will stop
i try to make it stop, i pray it will stop
i, stop, i am what you not
i try to make it stop, i pray it will stop
i try to make it stop, i pray it will stop
i try to make it stop, i pray it will stop
i, stop, i am what you not
i try to make it stop, i pray it will stop
