if i die right before i wake
cross my heart, then i seal my fate
life in the dark of the heartless
looking at the remedy for all this
everyday they look at you a target
falling victim, them and
him and her then this one, insensitivity
talk bad religion, skin identity
lack rash decision made by yours
pack facility with the urban boy
gun admitted he bear arm
the entity, arm and leg and head made to destroy
80% of the victim was yours
maybe i get to relive years of war
look on the corner, we been here before
look at the momma, you seen tears before?
pain bright and early
rain, sleet, hail, snow, worry
more storm barricade the city
prosecution, unhung jury
these days murder keep 'em busy
sweet blood flowed on the gurney
yellow tape tied around the street
colin kaepernick was more than worthy
i could reverse the day, reverse the time
reverse the block, reverse the gun, reverse the shot
reverse the law, reverse the flaw
that made us all the versions of a danger flock
reverse the love, reverse the hate
reverse the hope, reverse the way we playing sin
reverse the moment, so we can live again
life and times of the american skin

is it a gun? (what is it?) is it a knife? (what is it?)
is it a wallet? (what is it?) this is your life
it ain't no secret (it ain't no secret)
sure ain't no secret (it ain't no secret)
no secret, my friend, you can get killed just for living in
you can get killed just for living in
you can get killed just for living in
your american skin
