said i'm a fuckin monster
a massive attack will haunt ya
mastered the rap then fucked up the monitors mastered that
after that i went for thermometers
popped them all then popped them in the jar
tracy veronica holla back
they promise there’s no pyjamas
insomnia when attack i attack like piranha
there's hit your block like a comet
and you all know what time it is 2012 mark your calendars
calisthenics and silence is exercise
and that trigger strapped
rock with us mеtallica competition
no talent i'm in the junglе
loud enough just might stumble
upon a pack of lions no lying
my soldiers dying
this is like rap alliance is lining with
stars and bars of a prison wrapped my science applying
pressure a stretcher is needed paint prostheses of your living dead
your stuff is a giga pet
you niggas can’t see me unless you watching that tv
ill hold your hug in my silhouette
my flow got the ceiling wet
i spit till i feel my breath start sinking my fuckin chest
she fuckin the fuckin best mean my dick is the dick of death
mean i'm killing that pussy like spike whenever that jerry slip


yeah dre
me and andre the giant 6'7" and climbing
whether your storm to your climbing
whether your beat making a rhyme and
bumpin' some feelings huh man with a handful of diamonds like jay fans on an island with ray bans
glasses, palmin' asses that probably came with a great tan
i'll be the motherfuckin' mecha of this hub city spectrum
where they at i will dissect them like a fuckin frogs rectum
while you're wrecking with irreputable my words so incredible
probably call the federal after i slaughter several
etcetera etcetera barely passing up celicas
telling us about shit
high power in your mouth bitch
and top dawg can vouch bitch
nigga what you bout
about face and army outfits the general’s head
means the hustlers and the criminals there
pinnotens reach the pinnacle of life in despair
and me i solemnly swear
to handle mine like a taliban and die for it
only difference is i ain’t never asked and i lie for it
only difference is i be spazzin and still a pow for it
put me in a category
i don't know what’s a sadder story
guts and glory your pain bore me
you ain't really lived it
i'll take you to a block where they crippin'
a puris that’s 5'2" gun bigger than the torso of pippen
bitch i been doin it since before you niggas ruined it
show me something different
you either kissin dick or givin me distance
you live in a district of dimebags and dummies
i know your statistics
who your bar he more like my assistant
get lost have an egg and a biscuit
break-fast when we aimin them biscuits
pay cash when your chain come up missin
q, q
