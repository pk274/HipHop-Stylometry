study long, study wrong, nigga
hey, y'all close that front door, y'all let flies in this motherfucker
close that door!
my og up in this motherfucker right now
my pops man with the bottle of hennessy in his hand, actin' a fool
hey, hey, babe, check it out, i'ma tell you what my mama had said, she like:

i could spot you a mile away
i could see your insecurities written all on your face
so predictable your words, i know what you gonna say
who you foolin'? oh, you assuming you can just come and hang
with the homies but your level of realness ain't the same
circus acts only attract those that entertain
small talk, we know that it's all talk
we live in the laugh factory every time they mention your name

you ain't gotta lie to kick it, my nigga
you ain't gotta lie, you ain't gotta lie
you ain't gotta lie to kick it, my nigga
you ain't gotta try so hard
you ain't gotta lie to kick it, my nigga
you ain't gotta lie, you ain't gotta lie
you ain't gotta lie to kick it, my nigga
you ain't gotta try so hard

and the world don't respect you
and the culture don't accept you
but you think it's all love
and the girls gon' neglect you once your parody is done
reputation can't protect you if you never had one
jealousy (complex), emotional (complex)
self-pity (complex), under oath (complex)
the loudest one in the room, nigga, that's a complex
let me put it back in proper context

you ain't gotta lie to kick it, my nigga
you ain't gotta lie, you ain't gotta lie
you ain't gotta lie to kick it, my nigga
you ain't gotta try so hard
you ain't gotta lie to kick it, my nigga
you ain't gotta lie, you ain't gotta lie
you ain't gotta lie to kick it, my nigga
you ain't gotta try so hard


what do you got to offer?
tell me before we off ya, put you deep in the coffin
been allergic to talkin', been a virgin to bullshit
and sell a dream in the auction, tell me just who your boss is
niggas be fugazi, bitches be fugazi
this is for fugazi
niggas and bitches who make habitual lyin' babies
bless them little hearts
you can never persuade me
you can never relate me to him, to her, or that to them
or you, the truth you love to bend
in the back, in the bed, on the floor, that's your ho
on the couch, in the mouth, i'll be out, really though
see, loud, rich niggas got low money
and loud, broke niggas got no money
the irony behind it is so funny
and i seen it all this past year
pass on some advice we feel:


you ain't gotta lie to kick it, my nigga
you ain't gotta lie, you ain't gotta lie
you ain't gotta lie to kick it, my nigga
you ain't gotta try so hard
you ain't gotta lie to kick it, my nigga
you ain't gotta lie, you ain't gotta lie
you ain't gotta lie to kick it, my nigga
you ain't gotta try so hard
