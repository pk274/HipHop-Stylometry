lord forgive me


kill him where he stand and stand over him
shake his hand, then jump back in that minivan
double back to his block and blam
i ain't backing down for nothing
i'ma back 'em down like shaq
with this black 2-2-3 in my hand
better pray that this chopper jam like a radio single, man
police radio signals saying that a 187 land on your corner
coroners comfort your momma
"momma, he's dead," the next morning
i toasted up with my homies
we drink and smoke marijuana
want us to change our ways? uh-huh
you see this game we play come from
uncles that raised me in compton
ask me what i have accomplished
i don't know, i don't have conscience
i just load up and start dumping on enemies
i'm headhuntin', no sympathy
ain't no love when you in these streets
just get something, protect your neck
'cause they coming for set, respect
split your onion, then chop your deck
your head tumbling like gymnastics (ooh...)
'cause ignorance is bliss


this the hardest shit you've heard from la this far
and i'm this far from a discharge, but never will i diss y'all
we all tryna ball, and when i got the rock, i'll dish off
until the day i pistol-whip you posers 'til y'all pissed off
then peel off in a hoopty
come back and make these niggas wanna shoot me


and they bitches wanna salute me or seduce me
indubitably, i'm too street—indubitably, i'ma do me
better than your bitch would, 'cause you niggas too weak
but just give me two weeks and i'm good
i'll make an album that'll put a smile on malcolm
make martin luther tell god i'm the future for heaven's talent
no tarot card reading; i'm foreseeing you niggas vanish
not only from the rap game—i'm including the planet
cats so watered-down, clowns can sink titanic
tie titanium around they neck and watch 'em panic
give me respect, dammit, or get damaged
die young, corpse identified by your parents
apparently, you a parrot, mocking me and my blueprint
but i won't share it, just make you cop it, then call you a sheriff
stop it, i'm hearin' the comments
the critics are calling me conscious
but truthfully, every shooter be calling me compton
so truthfully, only calling me kweli and common?
proves... that ignorance is bliss


and this still the hardest shit you've heard from la this far
and i'm this far, from a discharge, but never will i diss y'all
this my world, i grab the universe then play kickball
and they wonder why these california earthquakes hittin' so hard


i'm so-cal, you so-called rappers need to go call ghostbusters
'cause you busters are casper when i go off
i show up to show out and show off
you a hundred percent behind me
and if you are, then wreck your car
then walk up to my crime scene
i remember bein' seventeen, wishin' someone would sign me
now the only way these labels get me back is when they rewind me
backin' down bargains, backin' down bitches
we gon' flip her
once she off that blue dolphin, you gon' tip her
'cause ignorance is bliss


and willie b, i'm a fool on your beats
i bleed out the speaker as the speaker that spoke when they didn't speak
