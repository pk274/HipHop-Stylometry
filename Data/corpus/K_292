they wanna share my light, they wanna share my light
they wanna share my light, they wanna share my light
they wanna share my light, they wanna share my light
they wanna share my light, they wanna share my light
you can have all my shine, i'll give you the light
you can have all my shine, i'll give you the light


they wanna share my light, they wanna share my light
they wanna share my light, they wanna share my light
they wanna share my light, they wanna share my light
they wanna share my light, they wanna share my light
you can have all my shine, i'll give you the light
you can have all my shine, i'll give you the light

time and time, i drop line for line but only time will tell
if i ever go columbine and cop thirty 9s and cock back and kill
see, the truth is they wanna know
how close me, dre, and snoop is
or how the shoe fits when they choose this
to beat 2pac, but truth, i give two shits
'bout expectations or critics hatin'
shit, i just put moms on vacation
bitch, you never know my new location, it's across nations
court cases get thrown out
so tell the mothafuckin' king dethrone now
i am ruler, i am highness, the prince zamunda
i am the shit like what the prune does
black on black tint like kinte kunta
black is back, bitch, i'm kin to kunta
black-on-black crime resent the shooter
blat, blat, blat! i intend to mute ya
racks on racks, i don't rap on tracks
without my a-game, so please don't ask me about no pressure
bitch, with the grip of my fingertip i can hold this coast together


they wanna share my light, they wanna share my light
they wanna share my light, they wanna share my light
they wanna share my light, they wanna share my light
they wanna share my light, they wanna share my light
you can have all my shine, i'll give you the light
you can have all my shine, i'll give you the light
