sit still, and close your eyes (smoke to it)
what's behind the other door, oh
no more silence (no more silence)
don't kill this thing we got called love (don't shoot)
just searching for the perfect shot


i used to write rhymes, all day and all night
while you were playing playstation, my pencil was erasing lines
my conscious only knew whats half tight
at 3:14, it's time to give me a slice, my nigga
this is a dog's fight, my nigga
the soundtrack to life, my nigga
kendrick lamar, his momma called him that
he watched house party, and ate apple jacks
sold sega games, his cousin sold crack
he pumped reeboks, his uncles pumped packs
pump, fake, jumpshot, ball hit the back
board dreams of being pointguard was off limits jack
that's because that's these compton streets was built not to win
you killed the nigga, i stole a bible, is that a sin?
pardon me though, i'm searching for answers
the good kid from the ugly city, that's mad that he's handsome
where is the love?


when love comes calling, don't love back
when love comes calling, don't look away
when love comes calling (where is the love?), don't look back
when love comes calling, don't look away


give me rings, give me chains, mane
give me a blue benz, red porsche, red range
give me black bitches, white hoes, new clothes
a mansion with marble floors and security codes
then give me some land, or maybe i'll land a, g5
clearport, say hello to the man
give me awards, grammies, and let the crowd applaud
my name 'til they strain the veins in they vocal cords
give me fame and fortune, me and trump on golf courses
with that being said, give me tiger sports endorsements
give me billboards, whatever that people will kill for
manahattan and 40/40, no 40's but rose poured
give me vanity, give me kurt cobain sanity
give me a city where channel 7 newscasters cameras be
give me horror like amity, no, give me the charts
and if you ever renege, i'll still give you kendrick lamar, this is me
and that's love


now everybody smoke to it, for this is, the celebration
