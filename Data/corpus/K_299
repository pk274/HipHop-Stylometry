slaughter pigs like farmer john
my style got its own ambience
you feel my presence? live life like everyday class in session
learn something after 187 we burn some
for real kid, our uncle doing a 13 year bid
i pray to god he don't come out how he went in
gets ill, these streets got me packing a 9 mill
my mind stay black, either kill or be killed
it's real in the battlefield son
last week shawty do wop he at the ooh wop he said he ready to kill some
i said shawty chill, you ain't ready for that type of drama
plus karma for real
he shook his head, horizontal
he said he was out on consignment some dudes on the block tried to rob em
try? what you mean?
he said they tried until i reached in to the pocket of my jeans
i killed 2, but one got away which is bad news, because the hood didn't even cover my whole face
and i know he be back, but before he do that
i bring it to him first on the porch where he live at
damn shawty i can't knock you, its survival of the fittest
with that said, do what you got to
i shook his hand, then i walked away, then reality took a toll on me
shoulda never gave him that .38
looking at the ceiling in my bedroom
then the phone rang, hey k dot turn on the news
they didn't even say his name
but i knew it was him when it said another 7th grader was slayed
it ain't hard to tell
