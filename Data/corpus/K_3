pushing a hoopty, bumping the fugees
my life is a scary movie, your life is a male groupie
kendrick lamar broke the handle with 22 uzis
stuffed it in my mouth and cack-cack-cack!
killed the rappers that knew me
compton’s most wanted, i live my life in a dungeon
came out a dragon i can probably touch the sun with...
my bare hands, what are your plans? to win a grammy?
sweet taste of victory, like oprah’s punany?
don’t judge me that’s just some irony, trust me
i like to laugh and get lucky
my sense of humor is rumored to be a gemini’s company
come with me, in the planet rock
and i plan to rock in a plantation
chasing many legends that made it
face it you will never be pac-10 even when the planet stop
i’m 2012 on a 12-inch, aiming straight at your pelvis
elvis would come back as a black if he was hot
you’re just a mascot on a kim kardashian ass-shot
