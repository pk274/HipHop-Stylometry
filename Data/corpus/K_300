and everybody know the story of david and goliath
but this is bigger than triumph
this is for the warrior, this is for you and i
this is for euphoria, give me a piece of mind
god is recording this, won't you look in the sky?
tell him that you got the behavior of your neighbor
even when stability's never in your favor
fly with the turbulence, only last a minute
land on your dreams, and recognize you live it
walk through the valley and peaks, with bare feet
run through the flames, that's more passion for me
i passed testimony just so the world can see
my battle wounds on me, you watching me lick â€˜em clean
i know, i know, my pride, my goals, my highs, my lows
i know, i know, it's mind control
i know i could prosper, no impostor, prosecute my posture
i stand up and i stand by ya, what?
