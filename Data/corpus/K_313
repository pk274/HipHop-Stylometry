yesterday my nigga had told me his brother died
a day before that his homeless uncle was cold outside
a week before he seen the cancer in his mother's eyes
two weeks before that, couldn't pay his rent cause he lost his job
a month before that he lost the custody of his daughter
six months before that her mother said she won't see her father
and this before he did a year when them charges brought up
i shook my head, turned around then found a $100


i don't know why you keep blessing me
i don't know why you keep blessing me
i don't know why you keep blessing me
i don't know why you keep blessing me
i don't know why i don't know why i don't know why


yesterday i invaded privacy of a home
the day before that my partner had fronted me a zone
a week before i had loaded bullets inside that chrome
two weeks before that i shot them bullets and he was gone
a month before that i cursed my mother then slammed the door
six months before that i hit my woman, she hit the floor
i stormed out then seen a black honda accord
them hollow tips missed me then hit that little boy






so today i laid in my bed, stared at the ceiling
closed my eyes then asked myself how i was feeling
i analyzed on how a saint can play the villain
is my life coincidental or just god willing
i came to grips, jumped up, and looked out the window
see my nigga had that same little boy that didn't know
bullets is nameless, i guess this is meant for
me to give them a $100 then trash my pistol


now i know why you keep blessing me
now i know why you keep blessing me
now i know why you keep blessing me
now i know why you keep blessing me
now i know why, now i know why, now i know why


so i can bless you
so i can bless you
so i can bless you
