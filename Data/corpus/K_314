the first verse i'm speaking from lucy

"my name is lucy, kendrick, you introduced me, kendrick
usually i don’t do this but i see you and me, kendrick
lucy give you no worries, lucy got million stories
about these rappers that i came after when they was boring
lucy gon' fill your pockets
lucy gon' move your mama out of compton
inside the gi-gantic mansion like i promised
lucy just want your trust and loyalty, avoiding me?
it's not so easy when lucy know you love your father
i'm lucy, i loosely heard prayers on your first album, truly
lucy don't mind, 'cause at the end of the day you'll pursue me
lucy go get it, lucy not timid, lucy's upfront
lucy got paperwork on top of paperwork, i want...
you to know that lucy got you—all your life i watched you
and now you all grown up to sign this contract
if that’s possible"


i ride shotgun with a shotgun, i ride shotgun with a shotgun
i ride shotgun with a shotgun
jesus take the wheel i'll pay ya
i ride shotgun with a shotgun, i ride shotgun with a shotgun
i ride shotgun with a shotgun, i ride shotgun with a shotgun
jesus take the wheel i'll pay ya
