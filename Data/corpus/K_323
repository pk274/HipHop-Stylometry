watch how i kill 'em with the funky rhythm
rappers i babysit 'em like soap operas they are my children
you dealing with the most phenomenon
my style raw like madonna on, pcp
b-i-g, frank white used to rock hand me down air nikes
now i style proper, i gotta
be laced in linen that's versace
polo fleeces, my bitches in vicky secrets
dom perignon to carry on the festivities
cristal when the sun go down
anybody wanna touch me, the gun go "blaow"
it gets ugly, like new york momma, who want drama?
biggie drop bombs like osama, my bank account
what can i say? comma comma, comma
kami-kaze, snap shots at you like papparazzi
definition, junior mafia, ?


i don't worry bout' none of you rappers
most of y'all talking practice, actors like denzel
until you trapped in a lion den with stake
under your chin, oh well, shouldn't play with big poppa
357 over my boxers
magnum, tell the doctor i shot ya, ugh
toe tag 'em, crack with purple tops, we bag 'em
house licks, we ski mask 'em, baby baby
