i'm from the city where they concentrate on nothin'
but that red flag, blue flag, gang bang, murder state
elementary kids liable, they catch a case
so don't be surprised if a ten year old put one in your face
kick in your door, then put it to your face
shake you up a little bit, then ask "where the safe?"
streets ain't safe and so i got the toolie on me
movin' like a mario brother, pardon me brother
but you gon' have to come out that whip, your mama might love ya but
i'm lovin' what's on your wrist, i'm lovin' what's on your neck
i'm lovin' what's in your head rest
you might as well give it to me or be in peace with the rest, deceased
dippin' in lanes, duckin', dodgin' police
after we get away, we celebrate over chronic tree
who did you think rollin' with me? haha
i'm k-dot, compton, visit my streets, yeah!
