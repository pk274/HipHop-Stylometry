kites on my radar, life in my palms
we unite through the chaos (only for the purist)
tell them to obey ours
my cerebellum threw a rebellion from ar's
(room full of boom sticks)
the day i have a j.r., i tell him to work for god only
and quit his day job (motherfuck the bullshit)
radio never play ours
this revolution ain't televised with prayer
jumping over borders (woo!)
ain't no ruler for restrictions, ain't no police to deport us (uh!)
ain't no summers for our sons, ain't no dealings for our daughters (woo!)
every prosecution hung, save the verdict for the lawyers (uh!)
illuminate the corner (woo!), celebrate humanity
and scream back at me in the morning (uh!)
every field in mississippi, every street in california (woo!)
know the devil is a liar, it's the time to be anointed (uh!)
truck into a stream, disconnected to a dream
head bussin', hittin' nothing, even if i gotta bleed
sittin' waiting patient for a universal pain
politicking with the nation, this is big as you and me huh?
i let you find my contacts, okay
tryna set us off for combat, no way
waking up the spirit it's on every human being
if you with us, then you scream so one day you can shine way out!
me, i'm way, way out
way out, way out
