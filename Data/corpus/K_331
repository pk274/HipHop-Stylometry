god, let me right my wrongs
god, let me write this song
god in the middle with a month
let me hit the pawn shop, momma said we need a loan
god, let me dedicate this to the 80% that ain't never coming home
god, let me know you exist
in a city where a hundred hollow-tips get thrown
i'm off that centennial
fuckin' at the party, nigga, at the party, we fade ten or more
my hood came thinkin' we yellin', "we in this bitch"
then we yellin', "we in your bitch"
or you tellin' all of us our dwellin' inside of 2pacalypse, thug life
and we off that whoopty-whoopty-whoop
and we in that hoopty with the two choppers
so we're guaranteed to shoot
lock us in the l.a. county zoo
watch us eat a bear alive and, ooh
this feels so good to keep it true
this feels so good, i'm keepin' you
hope i'm teachin' you all the lessons i learned
when i made that turn off the 110
watch that marijuana just burn
this shit just make you wanna just sin
see that staples center high earnin' if the lakers get me a win
i'm gon' liquor shot in memory of pac, makaveli live again
bitch, i'm in


la (yeah), can't believe we fell in love in the city of la (motherfucker)
la, it's the city of angels, it can take you anywhere (anywhere)
la, la, la, we fell in love in la, la, la (fell in love)
we fell in love
