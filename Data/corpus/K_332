i love money, i love bitches, for the lack of better words
ain't got no time, ain't got no feelings, for the lack of better words
i missed your call 4 times this evening, for the lack of better words
the music loud, can't hear it ringing, for the lack of better words


but i say, "my ego gotta yeet, for the lack of better words"
i can't love you, i love these streets, for the lack of better words
but if it's true, you would trust me for better or for worse
i'm selfish, i can't help it, for the lack of better words


nah, nah, nah, all you do, make excuse
nah, nah, nah, all you do, is make excuse


(pussy, pussy, pussy, pussy)
i wish a nigga would (ah)

i wish this nigga (yeah)
i wish your mhm-mhm-mhh
i wish this nigga (uh)
i wish a nigga would
i wish a nigga (yeah)
stuck in a rock and a hard place, hard place
