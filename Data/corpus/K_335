see you in the mornin'

going, going, goin'
up there, nigga, i'm time zonin'—tell 'em i'm sky high
i'm sky high
nigga, i'm sky high

up there, nigga, i'm time zonin'—tell 'em i'm sky high

nigga, i'm sky high
see you in the mornin'
going, going, goin'



my turbo boostin', my jetpack cruisin'
get jet lag when i come back to these fuckin' humans
i could put planet earth in a canister
then continue my crater search, with captain kirk
look at my verse, you seein' signs?
you hearin' signals deciphered from district 9
no fuckin' rapper-cypher when meteors flyin'
the meters are flyin' but i'm way faster
run away bet i catch ya, fire like striking matches
i'm higher with martians laughin' in spaceships as stars is crashin'
hover above the masses, a massive attack we're mixin'
kendrick lamar with magic, pull rabbits from hats—
niggas—wanna hop on track—bitches—wanna hop on dick—
"damn! is that a fuckin' blimp?! no, o-m-g, that's him!"
a shootin' star hangin' over a new eclipse
hangin' over a big dip, when my music flip, nigga, i'm sky high
shit


see you in the mornin'
take off, nigga, i'm time zonin'—tell 'em i'm sky high
going, going, goin'
up there, nigga, i'm time zonin'—tell 'em i'm sky high
i'm sky high
nigga, i'm sky high
see you in the mornin'
going, going, goin'
