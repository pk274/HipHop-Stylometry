i think you'll find, sir, that there will come a time
when black people wake up and become intellectually independent enough
to think for themselves as other humans are intellectually independent enough to think for themselves
then the black man will think like a black man and he will feel for other black people
and this new thinking and feeling will cause black people to stick together
and then at that point you will have a situation
where when you attack one black man, you are attacking all black men
and this type of black thinking will cause all black people to stick together
and this type of thinking also will bring an end to the brutality inflicted upon black people by (black people)
and it is the only thing that will bring an end to it
no federal court, state court or city court will bring an end to it
it's something that the black man has to bring an end to
