give me fuel for the fire burnin' when i yearn these lights
in the midst of the hieroglyphs my fingertips start to write

for the record, i'ma wreck it, even if my record don't pop
i'ma tie a knot on a downtown buildin'
let it tow behind me, tell 'em they can find me
in the dark with the ghetto children
look at my heart, nigga, fuck your feelings, this is mе

ride like pac in his prime; thug life is now on radar
'til the federal come through and raid ours
reminiscin' when the l.a. raiders
was in my home, snapback fitted on my uncle's dome
and i don't condone dickridin'

and the semi bullets fly, but it turned me to a lion
