go getter with no cheddar
just a white tee and a swap meet sweater
my life is likely to see great endeavors
but i can't win if i can't get it together
what i gotta do in order to see success?
havin' the world's best to call me the best?
pull up at the grammy awards as the best dressed
with an address linked to a beautiful actress?
a dollar and a dream, i feel j. cole
word to the hole in my pocket and the hoes
that don't wanna fuck with a broke nigga with ambition
but the last time i checked, y'all was broke bitches
make a name for myself then bubble like the ass of buffy
when she wearin' a tight belt
the homies on the block can say whatever they say
i don't wanna be a killer, i wanna be a gates


what i gotta do in order to see success?
havin' the world's best to call me the best
pull up at the grammy awards as best dressed
with an address next to a beautiful actress
do i gotta run in your spot and start blastin'
better yet, rob the nearest nix check cashing
ear hustle on a nigga that's constantly braggin'
catch him at the light, snatch him out his jeep wagon
or maybe i gotta hook up with jose
cop 5 bricks of the yay, head to the bay
area or carry the birds to va
let the clipse distribute the work all day
then come back home
every three weeks flip three to six zones
homies on the block can say whatever they want
i don't wanna be a dealer, i wanna be a trump
donald, that is


in time, it'll come
just stay focused and humble, my son
show and prove, prove you're the one
it's not about who is dopest
who wants it the most
so just go out and get it
(and when i do i do it again
then i go back
when i do i do it again
then i go back
thug it out)
go out and get it
(but for now i'ma go head and doug it out
i gotta rhyme, rhyme)
go out and get it
go out and get it


so welcome to the story of my life
see i'm tryna get to get right off the shit that i write
make a fortune, buy some porsches for my momma and my wife
pops engine in this old school run tight
but as you listenin' to k-d-o-t
man, me and my girl split the bucket of kfc
she listenin' to drake and all i can say is "damn
these niggas that much better than me, baby?"
i don't think this is meant to be
cause i'm always losin' self esteem
she paused the iphone then said, "huh?"
i repeated what i said then she replied, "shut up"
you know you the best boy, you gotta keep doin' it
but don't forget when you do, just keep you in it
and never listen to what the industry say
don't be a typical artist, be more like jay
russell, barry gordy, quincy jones, bob johnson, sean combs, l.a. reid
young black entrepreneurs did what it took to succeed, yeah
so i gotta see success, i gotta make it off them rosecrans steps
risin' to the top like a soda shook up
bout to pop, and i'll pop on whoever's in my way
