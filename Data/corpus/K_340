i wrote my first bars in the car with stacy
how bizarre, my battle scars at large would lace me
big marbles, nigga
i lead this new generation, boy, don't argue with us
marvelous beat selectors, authors and novel spitters
and it's all for the literature
and it's all for the hideous, the nastiest flows, the chlamydia, uh
i ain't afraid to say i need you, ah yeah (hip-hop, hip-hop, hip-hop)
i promise i'd never leave you, ah yeah
my life is like twelve open mics of hopeless notes i write
for sure my folks unite soon as the flow get nice, the poltergeist
that scare emcees, my prototype for every, my share of deeds
and r.i.ps, you know my type of style is like my everything
apparently my appetite they famished, bite no hand that feed
the culture vulture die and bleed
my focus hold these thoughts and dreams
control this pen (look over your shoulder)
boldest lines of rhymes and things
devote my time and mind it seems
supposed to shine, remind i'm king
provoke the blind and bomb the fiends
the pros, the cons of diamond rings
i'm full of time but i'ma bring
the soul divine and cross between
what's yours and mines, the goal the green
the roads that show just what it mean
then grab shakur right by the wing
and fly before my vocals (scream!)
for hip-hop, look at my ziploc
bag full of goodies, you chris rock, hit the pookie and piss stops
since tube socks, baby, you a hell of a drug
just look over your shoulders when they fuck you over, it's love
i know ya
