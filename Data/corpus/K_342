she doesn't love me, no, she don't love me no more
she hates my company, guess she don't love me no more
i tried to get her up out of my head, left my bags at the door
she screamed she loved me like she never did before


and i told her, "go where you wanna!
go do whatcha wanna do, i don't care!"
and i told her, "go where you wanna!
go do whatcha wanna do, i don't care!"


i told that bitch, "i'm a sucker for love, you a sucker for dick"
suckin' dick in your mama tub, then your granny walked in
told the stupid nigga to duck under the water
he drowned, like an abortion
they booked you for manslaughter
you beat the case and i called ya
"sherane is not available now, leave a message at the tone
and kendrick, don't forget to buy two pair of those
expensive heels, you little fuckin' ferris wheel
fuckin' spinnin' on meâ€”fuck you think, we gon' get married still?
fuckin' mary had a little lamb, this ain't no fairy tale
fairy godmama better tell you how i fuckin' feel
like you should fuckin' beat it
or fuckin' eat it while i'm on my period
now have a blessed day!" (*phone hangs up*)
bitch, you serious?
i'm in the mirror with this look on my face, curious
why you ain't fuckin' with me? you cut me deep as caesarean
you know i want you bad as a benjamin, i'm delirious
i want you bad as the head shattered on george zimmerman
after the dillinger hit him diligently and killin' him
his mouthpiece for a cadillac emblem
that's analogy and metaphor for you
i should win a medal for all the ways i adore you
this is me talkin' cordial, yeah, i got some home training
that ain't what you like, ain't it?
what about if i was as famous as marshall?
would you give fellatio in the carpool?
cops pull us over, they just wanna know if you gargle
singin', "i hope she's good enough
meanwhile you're chasin' her"
chlamydia couldn't even get rid of her
pity the fool and pity the fool in me, i'ma live with her


she doesn't love me, no, she don't love me no more
she hates my company, guess she don't love me no more
i tried to get her up out of my head, left my bags at the door
she screamed she loved me like she never did before


and i told her, "go where you wanna!
go do whatcha wanna do, i don't care!"
and i told her, "go where you wanna!
go do whatcha wanna do, i don't care!"
