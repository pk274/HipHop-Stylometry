when i kick it, i kick it as if the beat was my enemy
you have thought it was ten of me, on point like a widow peak
i deliberately give 'em dillies that do what it do
painting a picture like doodling, dude you ain't shit but doo-doo
in the city where the semis get pointed at him, them and you
you can hide, you get, if you want to, i do karate moves
but the crouching tiger just might get broken down by a writer
yeah the passenger hopped out, but you got shot by the driver
there's a killer like everywhere, so why would you take it there
neighborhood terrorist got the terror when this people scared
that's why my intelligence tell me to keep a banger
tell me "fuck you" i'll tell you fuck you back with my index finger
i can flip on some killershit but i'd rather keep cool
keep it so remind it try not to be a pussy like you
nigga that cali cold attack, cali on my back 'till my torso break
this is where it's at, that's gangsta
