wait, hol' up, is that you?
with them big ol' thighs after school?
jay 305 had gave me high five
when i said i’m in hot pursuit
you said, "i won’t ride until kendrick drive
a new monte carlo that cruise"
and that shot my pride, i tried to improv
but no freestyle i never do
you lookin' for the nigga with the tallest 'fetti
you overlookin' every nigga that ain’t quite ready
to make it rain on you like i'm about to break a levee
hol' up, that pussy petty
yeah, your nails did, your hair did
your cell phone is selfish
it only got numbers that come with a hummer
her new prima donna i smelt it
tried to make you mine, ho!
tried to make some time, ho!
but i ain’t got the time or the patience
to stop and wait in line, ho!
her dreams holds versace
she fall for armani
only deal with rich niggas—fuck you and mick romney!
i’m grown now, i’m on my own now
i’m po-o-o-oppin'
change my phone now when i get home now
i got o-o-o-options
fast forward, wait, is that you?
with them big ol' thighs after school?
and your three kids and three baby daddies
same car note that’s overdue? i know
