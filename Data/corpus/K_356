the pressure's taking over me, it's beginning to loom
better if i spare your feelings and tell you the truth
lately, i redirected my point of view
you won't grow waitin' on me
i can't live in the matrix, huh
rather fall short of your graces, huh
this time, i won't trade places, huh
not about who's right, who's wrong, huh
evolve, the only thing known, huh
ask me when i'm coming home, huh
blink twice again, i'm gone


i choose me, i'm sorry
i choose me, i'm sorry
i choose me, i'm sorry
i choose me, i'm sorry
i choose me, i'm sorry
i choose me, i'm sorry


she woke up in the morning for the daily news
i was so low and mourning through the family feuds
baby, i told you a story and laid down all the rules
still, you won't grow waiting on me


i choose me, i'm sorry
i choose me, i'm sorry
i choose me, i'm sorry
i choose me, i'm sorry
i choose me, i'm sorry
i choose me, i'm sorry


'cause all of it's toxic
girl, i'm not relevant to givin' on profit
personal gain off my pain, it's nonsense
darlin', my demons is off the leash for a moshpit
baby, i just had a baby, you know she need me
workin' on myself, the counselin' is not easy
don't you point a finger just to point a finger
'cause critical thinkin' is a deal-breaker
faith in one man is a ship sinking
do yourself a favor and get a mirror that mirror grievance
then point it at me so the reflection can mirror freedom
she told me that she need me the most, i didn't believe her
she even called me names on the post, the world can see it
jokes and gaslightin'
mad at me 'cause she didn't get my vote, she say i'm triflin'
disregardin' the way that i cope with my own vices
maybe it's time to break it off
run away from the culture to follow my heart


i realized true love's not savin' face
but unconditional
when will you let me go?
i trust you'll find independence
if not, then all is forgiven
sorry i didn't save the world, my friend
i was too busy buildin' mine again


i choose me, i'm sorry
i choose me, i'm sorry
i choose me, i'm sorry
i choose me, i'm sorry
i choose me, i'm sorry
i choose me, i'm sorry
i choose me, i'm sorry
i choose me, i'm sorry
i choose me, i'm sorry
i choose me, i'm sorry
