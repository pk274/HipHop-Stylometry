sometimes, i look in the mirror
and ask myself, what i'm scared of
how dare the media portray me this way? i can hear the
crowds screaming the weirdest of chants
they all in my era or that's an error
role model, i can't, it's like i'm a parrot
apparently, i'm marking the dance
i seen done with the devil such a ghetto romance


time and time again, i find myself
inside the cerebellum of several felons
orion's belt couldn't live in my world
i seen tigers, lions let loose and spooked
i'm next door to earl
i guess i rely on jesus to save us
before our referral to man as my neighbors
witness ski masks, the masses don't know
i'm packing this four and harassing your ho
