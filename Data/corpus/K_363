shucking and jiving, wastin' my time
and i say never (never) again, we'll never be friends
you can bet your bottom dollar, bet you'll never mistreat my kindness
i say (never), you can pretend
and while i defend every comma that's on this corner
you wanna sleep in designer, don't yah? (never)
i comprehend and then i resent
the potential bein' together forever, that's what you promised for me (never)
fuck mr. cupid, put that vagina on me
