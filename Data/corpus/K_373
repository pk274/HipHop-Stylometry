it was one of the worst performances i've seen in my life
i couldn't sleep last night because i felt this shit–
ooh, ah, ooh, ah
ooh, ah, ah, ooh, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah
yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yee


enoch, your father's just detoxed, my callin' is right on time
transformation, i must had a thousand lives
and like three thousand wives
you should know that i'm slightly off
fightin' off demons that been outside
better known as myself, i'm a demigod
every thought is creative, sometimes, i'm afraid of my open mind


shit on my mind, and it's heavy
tell you in pieces 'cause it's way too heavy
my diamonds, the choker is heavy
more lifе to give on demand, are you rеady?
who keep 'em honest like us?
who in alignment like us?
who gotta heal 'em all? us (us)
when there's no one to call


uzi, your father's in deep meditation
my spirit's awakened, my brain is asleep
i got a new temperature
sharpenin' multiple swords in the faith i believe
i think about robert kelly
if he weren't molested, i wonder if life'd fail him
i wonder if oprah found closure
the way that she postered the hurt that a woman carries
my mother abused young
like all of the mothers back where we from
ssi bury family members
at the repass, they servin' popeyes chicken
what you know about black trauma?
f&ns, kickin' back is another genre
tyler perry, the face of a thousand rappers
using violence to cover what really happen
i know somebody's listenin'
past life regressions to know my conditions
it's based off experience
karma for karma, my habits insensitive
watchin' my cousin struggle with addiction
then watchin' her firstborn make a million
and both of them off the grid for forgiveness
i'm sacrificin' myself to start the healin' and...


shit on my mind and it's heavy
tell you in pieces 'cause it's way too heavy
my diamonds, the choker is heavy
more life to give on demand, are you ready
who keep 'em honest like us?
who in alignment like us?
who gotta heal 'em all? us (us)
when there's no one to call us (us)


say, "hydrate, it's time to heal"
safe, you're frustrated, i can feel
huddle up, tie the flag, call the troops, holla back
huddle up, tie the flag, call the troops, holla back
yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
(ooh-ooh-ooh, da-da)
(ooh-ooh-ooh, da-da)
(ooh-ooh-ooh, da-da)
people get taken over by this pain-body (ooh-ooh-ooh, da-da)
because this energy field (ooh-ooh-ooh, da-da) that almost has a life of its own (ooh-ooh-ooh, da-da)
it needs to (ooh-ooh-ooh, da-da), periodically, feed on more unhappiness
