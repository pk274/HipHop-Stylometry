my people don't love me
why we hate each other?
why we kill our brothers? why we hurt our mothers?
my people don't love me
we can love one another
we should stick together 'cause we're all we got
my people don't love me
why we ride on another, need to love one another
we all we got
my people don't love me (huh)
i said we all we got, i swear to god, dog we all we got
my people don't love me


my people don't love me
why everywhere i go, i got to accumulate some hate?
my people don't love me
genocide all we know, shit, we basically in the kkk (alright)
ok-k-k, i'm tryin' to make my cake
but every time i turn around you take it from me, so
black people don't love me
hate each other we do each other wrong
that's why today, black people let's love, we


can't be a positive black role model
leadin the future with no haters to follow
now that's fucked up, if i ever wanna see
success, i gotta see death? be famous for what?
he aimin' for higher learnin', you aimin' to shoot it down
he flyin' straight, you wanna u-turn him
you burn your brother's bridges
his accomplishments making way for your children
still you don't compliment, inconsiderate black pride
no, never been, never win, gotta lose
that's the slope that's for the black heritage
we play the fool better than comedians
disobedient dude, no respect, ethics
i refuse to be a statistic
but changin' my community don't seem realistic
show me an african american doin' right
i'll show you one that'll kill his ass tonight
fucked up, baby
