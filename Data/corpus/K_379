i used to dream of risin' now i see it clearer
how surprising, i'm admiring that mirror
i'm inspiring the finer things in life
and your time is slowly expiring, you're crying me a river
that's ironic because she have a river as well
i like to swim in it like olympians, y-s-l
and some timberlands, high as hell
a ceilin' is an understatement, i burn through it, prove it's a fire drill
fire hoes, bad bitches fire hoes
fire then re-hire hoes
her entire crew is tired of the liars that you runnin by her
i can see you, hoe
plenty priors of a fuck nigga, nigga, i suppose
i can fly her, put her in attire of designer clothes
dayton wires on the chevy, why are you not tolerable?
don't you know they already fuck me, i'm a made man
maids in the mansion, clean 'em up out here
