in every inning sure your career's ending
you niggas ain't winning, really you're short winded
the bases is loaded you ever notice
your spot in your game was took, as i look at your team choking
sore losers never can play us, a chin bruiser
send shooters on your block scurting off on a scooter
i'm raising my stock with every hit record, look at my record
your status will drop soon as they message me in the session
minor league coaches we feed them bitches to vultures
you posing as a poser, we post your death on a poster
your highlight is getting closer, to stardom we never start em
we starve em and tire mark em, in the dust so you can watch em
in god trust, i'm probably tied up with a cheerleader
just your luck you fucked around and let a queer lead ya
time's up, you play softer than damien
we aim it at your cranium and leave fragments over the stadium
