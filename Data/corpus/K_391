i know she 'bout to ask me how she look
i tell her beautiful and how long it took
for you to put it on, it was early in the morn'
she resembled a model out of a mac book
concentrating on the way the eyeliner thickens
i stand behind her and try to figure her vision
of prettiness, the wittiness of colors on her skin tone
her complexion in a direction i've outgrown
damn girl, why so much?
you 'bout to blow your cover when you cover up
don't you know your imperfections is a wonderful blessing?
from heaven is where you got it from
i love your smile, you can do it without style
from your lips all the way to your eyebrows
it's the beauty in her, but when the makeup occur
i don't see it, all i see is a blur

he stand behind me and try to figure her vision

my complexion in a direction i've outgrown
i feel like it's not enough
i can never put on too much makeup
yeah, i know your imperfections, i be constantly stressing
from him is where i get it from, they tell me i need to
smile at least once in a while
i hate my lips, my nose, my eyebrows
it's the beauty in me, but what he don't see
is that i had a black eyeâ€” to be continued, eleven


ladies and gentlemen
and you ain't gotta get drunk to have fun
you ain't gotta get drunk to have fun
and you ain't gotta get drunk to have fun
you ain't gotta get drunk to have fun
