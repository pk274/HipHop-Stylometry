hey, baby, you forgot your ray bans
and my sheets still orange from your spray-tan
it was more than soft porn for the k-man
she remember my sprinter, said "i was in the grape van"
um—well, cutie, i like your bougie booty
come, erykah badu-me—well, let's make a movie
hell, you know my repertoire is like a wrestler
i show you the ropes, connect the dots
a country girl in north hollywood
mama used to cook red beans and rice
now it's denny's, 4 in the morning, spoil your appetite
liquor pouring and niggas swarming your section with erection
smoke in every direction, middle finger pedestrians
r&b singers and lesbians, rappers and managers
music and iphone cameras
this shit unanimous for you, it's damaging for you, i think
that pussy should only be holding exclusive rights to me, i mean
he flew you in this motherfucker on first class
even went out his way so you could check in an extra bag
now you wanna divide the yam like it equate the math?
that shit don't add up, you're making him mad as fuck
she said she came out here to find an a-list rapper
i said, "baby, spin that 'round and say the alphabet backwards"
you're dealing with malpractice, don't kill a good nigga's confidence
just 'cause he a nerd and you don't know what a condom is
the head still good, though; the head still good, though
make me say "nam myoho renge kyo"
make a nigga say big words and act lyrical
make me get spiritual, make me believe in miracles
buddhist monks and cap'n crunch cereal
lord have mercy, thou will not hurt me
five buddies all herded up on a thursday
bottle service, head service, i came in first place
the opportunity, the proper top of breast and booty cheek
the pop community, i mean these bitches come with union fee
and i want two of these, moving units through consumer streets
then my shoe released, she was kickin' in gratuity
and yeah, g, i was all for it
she said, "k-lamar, you kinda dumb to be a poet
i'ma put you on game for the lames that don't know they a rookie
instagram is the best way to promote some pussy"
