back when my driver's license was babyfaced and triflin'
i made my way through crisis, i made my tape
and recorded portraits in front of sirens, i made you hate the vibrant
you can't escape the tyrant, you can't relate where i've been
in '98, my problem: actin' too grown and shit
cappin' at bitches, yeah, my religion through songs and shit
on me, that's on me
raise up, nigga, you are not the homie
bitch, i’m well-connected from my section down to long beach
fumblin' with tetris if your block neglectin' your ki
every day, i wake up with my face up to my father
makin' sure my heart is pure enough to grow my seed and harvest
all my green and stuff and double up my plantation with dollar
every dream is such reality, my déjà vu done caught up
bitch, i'm brought up with the homies, that's on me
24/7, kendrick reverend these cold streets
dog, we live by it, die by it, then reincarnate
and if game told me, "drive by it," i raise ak
ain't no shame on it, cry about it, fuck that, i play
like no name on it, blindsided, ain't no one safe
documentary had identities of where i'm from
therefore, my energy had to make sure the better me won
it ain't no better one, son, it ain't no tellin' me nothin'
nigga, that's chuck, doc dre and k, the legacy's done, blaow!


oh, man
you thought these niggas with attitude would show gratitude?
fooled you
from 2015 to infinity, it's still bomb weed and hennessy
i can pimp a butterfly for the energy
game, i need acapella


on me, that's on me
on me, that's on me
on me, that's on me
raise up, nigga you are not the homie
on me, that's on me
on me, that's on me
on me, that's on me
raise up, nigga you are not the homie
