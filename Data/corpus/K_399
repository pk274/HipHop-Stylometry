❲?❳ unlikely
i say there's no such thing as side piece
i need the isolation entirely
i need your iso’
woah, woah, woah, woah, woah


good energy in the room, drop the location
antibiotic for the womb when i’m frustrated
forever have umbilical cord with you
a baby with adrenaline force with you
i reminisce on hennessy wars with you
beforе i knеw what tours can do, whores'd do
harmonica tricks mimicking moniker thеm
how’s the viеw from a lonely hill
i'm silent but i can't sit still
i'm convinced that the more i make
the more i break, the more they cleanse
pilates again, the more you bend, the more i break
the more i drank, hollywood juice from a cup i chase
probably pursue every bitch with a bum ass lace
that’s what you think
i'm twiddling feelings again
pivoting hums and sad songs
how considerate ken
i'm going numb doing wrong to the one i dub
know the one i trust
see the hate in your eye
you're the one i love
look what one eye does
times a hundred and sum', thousand
but who's keeping the count refund
it was all in fun, know you felt that crush you
it was all or nun'
i know priest' are catholic police
i'm fabulous on beats and drum
should i peace and run?
bought my niece a pony
then i acted a ass
what a derby i done
how could i confront all my drama at once?
got my momma ecstatic
got me lying in tongues
face down in my own shit
tell me own shit that i do
been homeless, where i live now, no rules
bought atonements that are now in my rear view
for the moment, i was found in my own truth
