if i said i'd be doing this at 16, would you believe me?
or see me to be just the innocent kendrick you've seen in the street
with a basketball and some now and laters to eat
i'm mashing all of my skeletons, would you jump in a seat
would you say my intelligence now is great relief?
and it's safe to say that our next generation maybe can sleep
with dreams of being a lawyer, a doctor
instead of a boy with a chopper that hold the culdesac hostage
and do 'em all if they gossip
children on the corn, stay vandalizing the option
of living a lie, driving their bodies with toxics
constantly drinking and drive
hit the powder then watch this flame that arrive in his eye
listen coward the concept is aim it, then bang it, then slide
out the bitch the deposit
the prize on his head that tithes probably'll go to the projects
i live inside the belly of the critics
and snoop passed us the torch, i'ma burn you rappers with it
what's up?
