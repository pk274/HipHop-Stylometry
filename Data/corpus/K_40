like my nigga meet me outside
these homies rush me just so they can steal my flashdrive
my music that important, imported in ipod
buying my cds like payin ties, act god
i'm sure success will taste better than nectarines
growing in the spring, basket's the fruit of life
had the boy arrange me every time i pick up the mike
i hop my entertainment be a bigger impact than mike
can i live like the princess of munda?
got a princess to groom the lacks o my scalp with a golden comb
and i'm on, cloud 9, stopping acts like in the sky
i'm from compton, can't you hear me coming like i'm from the shy
i'm inspired from a magic twice, which art is a rep and run?
but if they knew my intentions the reff and probably run
i'm just a good kid from the city who made straight a's
tryna make the transition from rose to kool aid
