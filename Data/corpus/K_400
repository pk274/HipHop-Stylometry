i say, thinkin' of a master plan
motherfucker, i'm a mastermind
i'm an 18-year-old dollar sign
i'm a one-man tragedy, i'm columbine
i'm sharp as fuck but no porcupine
penitentiary blade to cut yo' ass up
good-lookin' hunk
lookin' for anybody thats lookin' for me
shotty look 'em right in the eye
what do i see?
a scared nigga waitin' to die
a scared nigga, i even got you a suit and tie
something suitable
sledge hammer break down your nail cuticles
nigga, i do the unusual
torture
anything is necessary in the art of war
slam his head inside the suicidal doors
do him like li'l man off players club
roll around till his knees rub
shit
i'm a ground hog
no, i'm a young hog
hoggin' up all the money from all a y'all
it's funny how all y'all wanna be my associates
come around, smile, like that shit is appropriate
i'ma put it to your skullcap and open it
leave it on the side with that ho you was rollin' with
i'm rollin' with the nine millimeter close to my nuts and dick
you know who you fuckin' with?
i'm done with regular bowel movements
i'm on some other shit
i'm a fuckin beast, you a fuckin' bitch
i'ma fuck your bitch
then send her back to you
let her suck some dick, then let her kiss on you
now, ain't that a bitch?
that ain't right, but that’s my life
if you don’t like then we gon’ fight
psyche—you gon’ be fightin' a bullet

where the pump at?
thinkin' of a master plan
mothafucker, i'm a mastermind
i'm a 18-year-old dollar sign
i'm a one-man tragedy, i'm columbine
shit, you already know what i'm about
keep the guns by the couch in the living room
company act up, we give it to them
send it to them like emails
let them sell his soul
put his body on retail
if we do dirt and you tell
we gon’ put you under dirt
he was a good person
he was down to earth but now he down to earth
chillin' with the worms and the insects, his brother gon’ be next
his mother gon’ be after him, kill the family tree
if they fuckin' with him and that "him" is me
and that limb is lost on your body
aiming at your feet, probably
