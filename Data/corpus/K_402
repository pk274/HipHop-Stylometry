fuck y'all want from me?
y'all don't want money, y'all don't want from me
y'all wanna die in the chase of things
we all gon' die and embrace the thing
trapped inside a burnin' church
made it out alive, god know my worth
raw face, scarface
y'all face more defeat, i know it hurts
20 of 'em, 20 on call
got 20 in my hand, got 20 on judge
gave 20 to my dog, got 20 on girls
that'll fuck you to— (zoom zoom zoom)
that'll fuck you then fuck you over
take your safe, take your keys, take your rover
take the heart you thought you had
speed off, rollin' up life in a taxi cab

(you're dead to me)
