welcome to the story of my life, the mis-education of kendrick
stressin hennesy shots throw 'em back like it's vintage
wondering can i live where is the generosity
something's just gotta give, tryna stay positive
my motives to be a mogul, searching for a dollar without compromising my vocals
really i'm just a noble kid from the westside of compton
my cousins were selling crack while we play sonic
you niggas is nonsense
i say that you full of shit
and need a colonic or maybe the heimlich maneuver to throw up what you consume
my shine is bright enough to make a dead flower bloom in a room full of curtains
i'm for certain that i'm certainly popping the pistol verbally
and never will i get shot, your aim is all fucked up as if your sidekick dropped
i'm nice with a... throw over and over again
you know who i do it for
me, me
