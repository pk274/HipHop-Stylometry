if that nigga want me dead, i can't let that nigga breathe
want me gone, sent a shot, like the real kind
these niggas actin' like they tough when they real kind
thumbin' through a hundred racks just to kill time
they got a nigga at the edge, but i feel fine
but it come with this shit, i'm okay with it
if your man's to his last share a plate wit' 'em
one whole wood to the neck, it's an eighth in it
new baby chop, let it sing, it's a drake nigga
a lot of shit on my mind make me think a lot
why it's hard for me to smile? 'cause i seen a lot
you ain't really in the field, you just tweet a lot
if we ain't on the same page, you can kick a rock, bitch!


and i been really tryna keep the peace
but i'm a north vallejo nigga, and i'm heavy in the streets
i was raised by my granny and the gangsters
so at eight i made the choice i'ma forever be a g, and
i don't really like to talk
i remember we was broke and i don't really like to walk, nigga
now i ride around in foreign cars
and i put on for my team who was with me from the start, nigga
i don't play games, stitch lip, i don't say names
she want a dog, i'm a great dane
i got great aim, ice age on my damn chain
my momma told me keep a stash for the damn rain
they ain't wanna see me win 'cause i'm black
so i pulled up in that all black benz in the back
if you need someone to call, i'm the man for the task
you ain't standin' for the cause, meet the man in the mask
