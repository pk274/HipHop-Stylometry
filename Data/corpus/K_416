i tell 'em all to hail king kendrick, resurrectin' my vengeance
been dissectin' your motormouth, 'til i break down the engine
this ain't no warnin' shot, this a relevant henchman
see my opponent, then â€” cease your existence
endin' our friendship, baby, i'd rather die alone
your diaphragm is dietary, what you eatin' on?
capture your audience with these words, boy
the holy chapel, the tabernacle, the book of matthew
and jesus starin' at you, take your turn, boy
see? it's gon' take a whole lot of y'all to kill me
see? it's gon' take a whole tribe of y'all to kill me, i never die
my pedigree apparently only to idolize
ahead of me is only my future and idle time
longevity, i gotta get used to makin' you mine
you tellin' me i only get used to livin' if fine
you can never live in my shoes, permanently paid from god


when the sun goes down, i scream loud, i'll sleep when i die
but i will never die, my legacy is alive
when the sun goes down, i scream loud, i'll sleep when i die
but i will never die, my legacy is alive
