if all of the shame stops, all of the pain stops
oh, what a life it'll be
standing outside catching all of the vibes
ah, ah-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah, yeah


take off the foo-foo, take off the clout chase, take off the wi-fi
take off the money phone, take off the car loan, take off the flex and the white lies
take off the weird-ass jewelry, i'ma take ten steps, then i'm taking off top five
take off them fabricated streams and thеm microwave memes, it's a rеal world outside
take off your idols, take off the runway, i take off to cairo
take off to saint-tropez, five-day stay, take a quarter mill', hell, if i know
take off the false flag, take off the lace front, take off the shots with the mop ass
take off the contour, take off the contrast, take off the eyes with the contacts
take off the fake deep, take off the fake woke, take off the, "i'm broke, i care"
take off the gossip, take off the new logic that if i'm rich, i'm rare
take off the chanel, take off the dolce, take off the birkin bag
take all that designer bullshit off, and what do you have? (bitch)

the world in a panic, the women is stranded, the men on a run
the prophets abandoned, the law take advantage, the market is crashin', the industry wants

can i vent all my truth? i got nothin' to lose, i got problems and pools, i can swim on my faith
cameras movin' whenever i'm movin', the family suin' whatever i make
murder is stackin', the president actin', the government taxin' my funds in the bank
homies attracting the feds when i'm bracking, look at my reaction, my pupils on skates (hold up, hold up)
let's think about this for a second (let's go)
tell me what you would do for aesthetic (let's go)
would you sell your soul on credit? (let's go)
would you sell your bro for leverage? (let's go)
fake nigga wanna chime in on 6ix9ine when he know his whole neighborhood tellin' (let's go)
