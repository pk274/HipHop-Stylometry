from the 6 where drake claims the crown
soft-spoken verses, his fame's a countdown
champagne dreams, but my flow's the surge
in this rap game, i'm the lyrical purge

counting numbers, but i count the beats
drake's rhymes smooth, but the substance depletes
spotlight dancer, fame's fleeting potion
my words intricate, causing a commotion

money talks, but my rhymes talk louder
in this showdown, he's the fading powder
maestro on the mic, dissing with precision
drake stumbles, it's a clear collision

arena's mine, undisputed reign
drake's echoes fade, like a distant train
prince of soft, i'm the street's heartbeat
in this clash, my victory's sweet


yeah, logic straight from the basement mic to the suites, i think this is very sweet to me
k. dot, ye, ty or drake. pete, noname, no. id, jid, or ye
no ones deserve the crown expect for jay, nas and then
