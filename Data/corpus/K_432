they say that i'm the one
and you, you are the prototype
you might have the ears of sound
but you already know who they like
you niggas need hugs for real
somebody to hold you real tight
you niggas need hugs for real
somebody tell 'em he's the prototype


i am the truth, no lie about it
bring my testimony when i walk in that booth
walking the thin line between love and hate, i defend mines
join them when it comes to their crunch time, i never fold
i love pressure, that's why i apply so much on niggas thinking they better
i am a clutch shooter, i am a sharp shooter
and it's great enough to hear the butterfly moving
follow me moving through these ghetto streets and school i say fuck a tardy sweep
walk into school the chief right there tried to talk at me
in the midst of piru and natty blood beef
shall we hesitate to walk down palmer 
you niggas need hugs for real
somebody to hold you real tight
you niggas need hugs for real
somebody tell 'em he's the prototype
