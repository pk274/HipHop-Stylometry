mmm, tippy-toeing and i'm mud-walkin', hmm
rollin' sevens, i ain't bred for no coffin
i know y'all love it when the drugs talkin', but
shut the fuck up when you hear love talkin'
shut the fuck up when you hear love talkin'
if god be the source then i am the plug talkin'
yeah, baby, yeah, baby
yeah, baby, yeah, baby


this my undisputed truth, uh-huh
my life is like forbidden fruit, my bitch know better than i do
a woman's worth, i barely went to church, i'd rather fast with you
than fuck it up, fucking with skirts 'cause i'm rational
a nigga still gon' be a nigga, emoji heart, my family pictures
two-steppin' away from rappers, i don't trust their true intеntions
i'm not in the music business, i been in the human businеss
whole life been social distant, hoes like when you not trippin'
i duck the party, who said they saw me?
crown on bob marley, wrist on yo gotti
they gon' judge yo’ life for a couple likes on the double tap
them hoes is sorry, they all get bodied
i bless it that you have an open heart, i bless that you forgive
i bless it that you can learn from a loss, i bless it that you heal
i bless one day that you attract somebody with your mind exact
a patient life, flaws, bless 'em twice, and they'll bless you back


tippy-toeing and i'm mud-walkin', hmm
rollin' sevens, i ain't bred for no coffin
i know y'all love it when the drugs talkin', but
shut the fuck up when you hear love talkin'
shut the fuck up when you hear love talkin'
if god be the source, then i am the plug talkin'
yeah, baby, yeah, baby
yeah, baby, yeah


(how's love) how's love when it's haunting your soul?
but my nigga left, his ass on the road
gossiping 'bout some shit you don't know
oh, you ho (yeah, yeah, yeah, fo' sho')
i hate it here, baby daddy still on my phone
i hate it here, asking if i been on the pole
i hate it here, if you keep lurking on the low
if you a fan, just let me know
yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah (yeah, yeah)
now, if it's love, i deserve to get some head on a balcony sometimes, sometimes
and if i feel where your heart can be, you'll still be a part of me
i love my, love my (love my, love my)
summer in the storm, i cannot conform
(i cannot conform, i cannot conform)
i just might love you still, just think i love me more
it ain't love if you gon' judge me for my past
no, it ain't love if you ain't never eat my ass
it ain't love if you just only tie me down because you seen me in my bag
that's why i'm anti-everyone before this mask


mmm, tippy-toeing and i'm mud-walkin', hmm
rollin' sevens, i ain't bred for no coffin
i know y'all love it when the drugs talkin', but
shut the fuck up when you hear love talkin'
shut the fuck up when you hear love talkin'
if god be the source, then i am the plug talkin'
yeah, baby, yeah, baby
yeah, baby, yeah

tippy-toeing and i'm mud-walkin', hmm
