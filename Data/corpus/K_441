they say pressure bust pipes
and i ain't never had to deal with plumbing in my life, now that's a bar
sparring with me like blasphemy to cathedral
or colliding with the diesel with your baby in your arms
you would test me but you know better
it's inadequate to go against the jesus of nazareth
of the rap game, and guess what, i got no cheddar
but my mind is like a wizard
i defy the laws of gravity every time i get high and write a sentence
back teeth never been in agony, but i got wisdom
i have risen from the wicked to jump on the competition, scorch ya, third degree burns next to their sideburns,
all sorts of combustible flows, firemen on speed dial
free the leaders of the free world with a freestyle
free the teachers, black activists get up off your feet now
and feed off my feelings
as i control my wheel like new power steering, so sincere
tryna duck court hearings but i got big ears
rap peers, used to study them wishing they would fuck with me
now they can't fuck with him, i'm wishing good luck to them
reluctantly these critics loving me and i don't blame 'em
they say, kendrick you gunning for these niggas
so when i pull my weapon out, i give 'em the pleasure to see me aim it
and watch these bullets run into these niggas, clear the set
i got now, i got next, give you nouns, give you verbs
give you adjectives while proposing an agitated threat
i am most debated in barber shops all because they slept on me
big homie fear young, buck cause when i buck i make more than a buck
dollars come quick like a fucking nun fucking for the first time
put me in alaska for six months in the dark, in my heart i know sun still shine
still got a skill to be found in a gold mine


too many relays for djs to replay
i do the reject while i eject your new singlay
hot enough to sit in hell, then unveil in heatwave
piss on a demon with ice water
and if i lose my voice then i'm probably calling out to all p.a
systems to assist in with the word i'm tryna spread
like county jail bread or the legs of a hoochie
and that's off top like a toupee, i'm 2pac
coming back for doomsday, spitting at cops, go and cop my album
get high to it, pop some valium, then turn up the volume
i influence ghettos where it says caution
and them bloggers get to sparking like l.a. females that's balling
round the time this happens often, the violence get the flare
we racing against life, the turtle or the hare?
and nobody can compare to the legacy that we bout to build
y'all work at build-a-bear soft as underhand pitching with skills


nigga, nothing but the best
every time we hit your tape deck niggas hit the deck
i rhyme like a fucking tec-9,
and i 'clown posses' if they disrespect
you looking at a t-rex snapping at 'em with tourette's
yeah, this the flow that killed aspiring rappers
too late, i grab the eight and start expiring rappers
some shit only big and pac could rap after
and if they was alive, they would have to pay tithes
i am god
m.c.r. squares will disperse in despair, this is me motherfucker
