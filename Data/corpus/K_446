i swear this industry shit, to me, is one big-ass lick
i walk inside of a buildin', tell the a&r nigga "strip"
tell 'em i need all of my chips, my life been on section 8
i've been a welfare case, afdc pump fake
meanwhile, i'm grindin' 'cause drug money ain't like rap money
four white kilo, snow-bunny, equal one whole show, dummy
i'm on this tour bus and i'm fucked up
i got a bad call, they killed braze
they killed chad, my big homie pupp
puppy eyes on my face, bruh
and i really be drinkin', why the fuck i really been smokin'?
what the fuck? i'm the sober one
man, i'm so stressed out, i can't focus
hide out when i ride out, ski mask with the eyes out
speed past in the cutlass, me and little ocho
every young nigga hop out
two tears in a bucket, i feel like "fuck it"
the price of fame, recognize my pain, it's all i know
all out war but i'm out here though
call my troops like, "vamonos"
i'm on this tour bus and i'm fucked up
i got a bad call, and it's all bad
off a og with my og and some oe by the tall glass
