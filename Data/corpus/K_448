how can i change the world, but can't change myself?
how can i please the world but not god himself?
how can i have the world, still need some help?
how can i see the world, stuck in this box?


how can i change the world, but can't change myself?
how can i please the world, but not god himself?
how can i lead the world when i'm scared to try?
why should i need the world? we all gon' die
