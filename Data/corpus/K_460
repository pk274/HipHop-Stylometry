look into the new vision in mind
kendrick divine intervention, i drop a jewel and the diamonds glisten
don’t chime in my business you’ll run into atomic collision
you knew my colonic was different
i’m shitting on shit that was shifting your image
i rhyme like a chemist
i rhyme like the guinness book of records was records i written
i rhyme and you mimic the rhyme that i didn't like when i did it
you bit it
your bite is so big you need bridges at night, and 9th can admit it
the pint that hennessy spiked this minute a mic and a menace
and time is dependent on what you pretending to be
your grind is diminished by me and mine is the menace the preach
i'm findin my soul on this beat definin' my flow
and you know i fold any foe at defeat its 4 in the morning
formin a george foreman that's a grill when i speak and i'm on it
till the mill in the jeep then living orders
i feel like feets of the fortune of gorgeous of bitches i see when recordin sheesh
