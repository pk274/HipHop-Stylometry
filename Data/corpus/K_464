sippin on that rossi wine
puffin turtle feelin fine
its just me, myself and i
all i need to free my mind
nigga, nigga (im out'chea) nigga, nigga, nigga (im out'chea)


in the middle of the warzone i be on
sippin on a big bottle of that burgundy
mutha'fuck yo styrofoam
big barrel, baritone
and it sound like barry white
and it boom like an eight-o-eight
turn yo' ass to a parasite
on the freeway i rock to the snare
don't get me out my loop my nigga
a bad bitch i ride with a pair
like the fruit my nigga
the paparazzi gone shoot my nigga
but i don't pay em' no attention, im a put em' in detention
head of the class, head in the e-class with the tint missin'
you said, i know that you said
more company? i probably don't need it


sippin on that rossi wine
puffin turtle feelin fine
its just me, myself and i
all i need to free my mind
nigga, nigga (im out'chea) nigga, nigga, nigga (im out'chea)
