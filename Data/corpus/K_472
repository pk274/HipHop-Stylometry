i cried when lil' bruh died
got high and watched the sunrise
wiggle on 'em if it's one time
they done hung all of my people
i love all of my people
i'm in the slums with all of my people
they tryna tell us that we all equal
we get no justice so it ain't peaceful, yeah
they can bluff you, they can beat you
paid attorney, we gon' need it
momma told me there was demons
and she ain't never lied on her jesus'
she worked her ass off just to feed us
she went to ross to cop the new adidas
she used to tap in with all the teachers
they wasn't teachin' nothin', it's no secret
whole lotta crime, lil' niggas beefin'
we gotta keep it or end up a victim
trapped in the system, traffickin' drugs
modern-day slavery, african thugs
we go to war for this african blood
we go to war for this african blood
when i put niggas on, it was all out of love
you was disloyal, can't call it no love


i am t'challa, i am killmonger
one world, one god, one family
celebration
