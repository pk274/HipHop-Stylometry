i live this life at a pace that anyone can go
know your place and dedicate your role, to the faith that you'll die alone
trace your steps when i do step in a fire of broken bones
and i require my heart's desire and when i reap what i sow
i bought my momma a benz, my boobie a jag
a car for my dogs, with a roof full of glass
but still i be feeling like none of my light never casts
out of that black cloud that's been watered down since my first chopper blast
but fuck that, i'm not worried, even when it's scary
skrrt off makin' them hurt off i should have hurt them in a hurry
dirt off all under my fingers, dirt all of 'em gon is gone is burried
shirt off when precedure, resuscitation came early
i need you to keep quiet as a mouse
which is ironic 'cause rats is what i'm talking about
i'm hearin the sonics of gun fire
the whispers, the silent cries
even though i know it's an eye for an eye
