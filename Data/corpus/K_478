as i reflect, i start realizing i wanna
make a way one day for me and my momma, family and friends
this ain't the way my life bout to end
so i'm quick to grab on my pen and
give 'em something my people sure to feel
give 'em something that i know is all the way real

uh, as i'm hearing the first and second verse
i try to analyse the feeling that's felt in the song
i want to tell rock and q to go to church
but that's a hypocrite because i ain't been in so long
i stare at the world from a righteous point of view
and realize a crisis coming
novocain couldn't numb it, the pain is unbearable times two
let's rally a team, summon, and school the youth
how you feel about it?
