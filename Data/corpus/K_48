love is life and life is love, i like to love
every part of you, the party life can never do enough
so many obstacles the possibilities are breaking up
can move in hospital with that extra patient you got me stuck
i'll play the prostitute if you've got the patience to pimp me
but you never put me on the strip, put it on then you strip
put it on your fingertips and i'll kiss it off
you better not kiss me goodbye, test my faith and kiss the cross
i'm trying to go there, take you slow there if it's alright
tell me that you care, baby, we could share a full life
truth and double dare that i do repair broken hearts
cupid shot me in the dark, stupid i didn't play my part
ask for your forgiveness, if it's worth it i can serve a purpose
if i'm st.. st.. stuttering because i'm nervous
tell me that you love me still, promise that i'm staying still
honesty is all i need, honestly, we can build
