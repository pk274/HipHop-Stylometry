say, say, say
i come from murder one, brung late night melee
say, say, say
we hung all summer, sprung mattress with bae bae
say, say, say
trippin' off dyke and my name strike with pay day
say, say, say
flippin' blue lightnin', tightenin', strapped with ak
say, say, say
og one, told me one, show me one, eight ways
how to segue
pussy, power, profit and headache
i reminisce my life innocence or life innocent
or life intimate, with fame
light limo tint with light women, dark women in it
aw, kenny, good game
she wanna hang with a starboy
the sun and the moon and star, boy
astronomer, anonymous
i line 'em up, we grind 'em up, there's nine of us
and five of us have probably fucked
she mollied up, i tallied up all the parts, boy
twenty legs, arms, head (head)
head, head, more head (head)
oh god, bless the dead (yup)
i'm livin' life, high off life
i wear my chokes off to bed
i'm the greatest nigga, why you scared to say it?
i wanna rock, i wanna rock
i wanna cop more land, i never stop
i wanna quick advance on a bill if it ain't one
break everything, i'm a hustler, came from
