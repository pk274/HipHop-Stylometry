come, come now, last call, who want some?
it's just me, two bitches, and dirty drums
two lips to kiss, 22 mother nuns
god blessed my tongue, i need it for life
awkward like cartwright, twiddling my thumbs
pondering my next accomplishments
it's condescending to say i won
two lips, you kiss my ass tonight, huh?


i really want it, need it
break bread or break fast
before i blast and break legs, ride past
and they scream out "little johnny is dead!" (oh, you dead, nigga)
you wish me well, i wish you hell
eternity, no such thing as time will tell
infirmary, burn like magnetic combustion
bad credit with me, and paramedics are hustlin'
what's the definition of water?
sherm sticks, sipped a gallon of it when you caught us
turn quick, i don't wanna play this for my daughter
if my son heard it, probably look at you as his father
i'm proud of myself in a bad way
halfway house, tell it to meet me halfway
i'm passin' out, ass-whoopin'
your ass lookin' for michelle obama 'til i bang on you
they couldn't
