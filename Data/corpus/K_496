i don't give a fuck, i don't give a-

i done cried for this shit, might take a life for this shit
put the bible down and go eye for an eye for this shit
d-o-t my enemy, won't catch a vibe for this shit, ayy
i been stomped out in front of my mama
my daddy commissary made it to commas
bitch, all my grandmas dead
so ain't nobody prayin' for me, i'm on your head, ayy
thirty millions later, know the feds watchin'
auntie on my telegram like, "be cautious!"
i be hangin' out at tam's, i be on stockton
i don't do it for the 'gram, i do it for compton
i'm willin' to die for this shit, nigga
i'll take your fuckin' life for this shit, nigga
we ain't goin' back to broke, family sellin' dope

i wish a nigga would
i wish a nigga would, i wish a nigga would
i wish a nigga would
i wish a nigga would, i wish a nigga would
i wish a bitch would
i wish a bitch would, i wish a bitch would
i wish a nigga would
i wish a nigga would, i wish a nigga would


i'm allergic to a bitch nigga, ayy
an imaginary rich nigga, ayy
seven figures, ho that's slimmer than my bitch figure, ayy
goin' digital and physical on all y'all, ayy
fuck subliminals, i put you on that roll-call
french montana speakin' on me in interviews
very cynical, dry hatin' somethin' i don't approve
jay electronica put silences on my grammy night
another dead prophet hopin' that god will give him life
big sean keep sneak dissin', i'll let it slide
i think his false confidence got him inspired
i can't make them respect you baby, it's not my job
you finally famous for who you date, not how you rhyme (boy)
cute ass raps, get your puberty up
then make you a classic album before you come at us
drake, your meek mill beef might get you gassed up
but i'm a whole 'nother beast, i'd really fuck you up


i wish a nigga would
i wish a nigga would, i wish a nigga would
i wish a nigga would
i wish a nigga would, i wish a nigga would
i wish a bitch would
i wish a bitch would, i wish a bitch would
i wish a nigga would
i wish a nigga would, i wish a nigga would


this goes out for those who choose to use disrespectful views on the king of hip-hop
fuck that, why try, throw bleach in your eye
now you brailin' it, fuck that light shit, i'm scalin' it
niggas thought they wouldn't gon' see me hah?
niggas thought k-dot real life is the same life they see on tv, hah
niggas think they can flex on me and still live in l.a. for free, hah
next time you hit the 10 freeway, we need receipt, hah
'cause most of y'all ain't real, most of y'all gon' squeal
most of y'all just envy, but jealously get you killed
most of y'all throw rocks and try to hide your hand
that passive aggressive shit only work for your fans
because it's all in your eyes, most of y'all tell lies
most of y'all on top, but none of y'all top five
most of y'all know i tried to lift the black artists
but it's a difference 'tween a black artist and wack artist (woo)
you're my sons, go to your room, go to your room!


i wish a nigga would
i wish a nigga would, i wish a nigga would
i wish a nigga would
i wish a nigga would, i wish a nigga would
i wish a bitch would
i wish a bitch would, i wish a bitch would
i wish a nigga would
i wish a nigga would, i wish a nigga would
