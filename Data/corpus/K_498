takin' shit from some nigga that shit right there sound dumb nigga
we gotta post stay in the street, take what we deserve and yeah i
serve on any artist that's my word that y'all are targets
i'm retarded on the mic, special ed.,
and bitch i call you special when you give up special head
i gotta feelin' it's gon' be a lot of killings kendrick
cause when i spit a verse i bring a hearse to every sentence
and put it in reverse and try to decode it
they on my dick and deep-throat it
they don't know it but boy i am a henchman, for hire
i require wack emcees, tell 'em that i'm burnt like 'swap meet' dvds
tell 'em that i earnt my respect on what you didn't do!
ain't nothin' difficult your admiration's pitiful! shame on you twice
life's a gamble so i'm comin' out the gate with tricked dice
7-11, 7-11, backed on that
it's been a long time comin' since i bodied a track
i'm back up in this bitch like the ass and pussy was fat

comp-town soldier, welcome to iraq
be ready for combat, or die on your sofa
brains on the plastic, yo stains on the cabinet

common sense of commentators that say i don't love enough well

any favors i invite in meaning lasers beaming off the
sun until i have a son and see you later motherfucker...
