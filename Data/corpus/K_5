schoolboy q, what's hatnin'?


i hate y'all, i'd do anything to replace y'all
shout-out to face mob
a geto boy 'til i'm unemployed with a day job
and kicking boxes
i kick ass and then kick knowledge
i'm way more polished than ninety-nine percent of the scholars you thought had graduated
i'm the master that masturbated on your favorite emcee
until the industry had wanted me assassinated
you either corny or an opportunist
i let you eat, now go back to church and steal crackers at communion
what are we doing? i'm 'bout to crack the da vinci code
yeah, and nothing been the same since they dropped "control"
and tucked a sensitive rapper back in his pajama clothes
haha, joke's on you
high-five, {*smack!*}, i'm bulletproof
your shots'll never penetrate
pin a tail on the donkey, boy, you been a fake
i got my thumb on hip-hop
and my foot in the back of your ass
aftermath get the last laugh
i serve niggas like master geoffrey, jump on the curb
turn a shotty to a verb if you let me, you know i'm a killer
i'm on your head, they know i'm a killer
the west coast cosa nostra, under oath 'til it's over
you over-owe us
so what the fuck? i fuck you niggas up, i fuck you niggas up
she suck and fuck, i fuckin' duck you fuck-niggas like when i want
you go at us, you going fucking nuts, acting irrational
pop you, then pop an adderall, know the drill like a lateral, nigga
i'm more pappy mason than pastor mason
pacing back and forth, racing, my thoughts on them racing daytons
i spilled blood on my apron cooking this shit up
i feel like some of y'all is hating
quite frankly, your bitch booty should thank me for grabbing it
turn these hoodrats to actresses, what a magic trick
accidents never happen when murder's involved
immaculate tactics, so follow me, if you need me, just call on me
i say, "hold up, wait a minute
your career ain't shit unless you got some kendrick in it"
you pussies ain't shit, ain't no room is left on my dick
'less you look like jordin spark, make my mark on that clitoris, mwah
hollywood's been good to me
lil' hood nigga, used to pawn mom's jewelry
family jewels big as fuck, and i got the balls to say it
balls-deep, balling out 'til spalding need a replacement
i'm outchea, the west in your mouth, chyeah
invest in the vest of vietnam vets when you out near
the white court building, spilling its merlot
fillin' women, a virgo pimped the industry
'member these stacey adams and fur-coats
shook, you're scared to death
you're scared to look in the mirror when kendrick is near youâ€”
king kendrick!
