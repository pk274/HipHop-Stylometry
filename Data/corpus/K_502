sittin' in the hooptie, lookin' for a groupie
bitch, i'm k.dot, act like you knew me
got me fucked up, me don't pay for no booty
you looking for a price, bitch, i'm not no fool, g
i'm hot like cooly, sicker than the cooties
i got all the juice, you something like a poomby
i'm soon to be the greatest for the ages of the young
watch the game like a raven, cravin' rappers 'til i'm numb
novacane can't contain the pain that i brung
bitch, i shine like a microscope bouncin' off the sun
words bouncin' off my tongue like a damn trampoline
hoes manicure, hemmin' up the bottom of my jeans so i kick him off
got haters pissed off, used to have no bank
look at my account, you see o's like rick ross
i drift off to the moon, martian
use the big dipper as a teaspoon
parkin' my ufo somewhere that you don't know
welcome to the c4, you see one, you see four
bombs in my peak hold, bombs over baghdad
son you niggas, you can never say i was a bad dad
run you nigga like a marathon
this is when vietnam meets the babylon
bring it to yo front porch, tanks on your grass lines
i'm mike jordan in his prime, jumpin' from the foul line
in order to see the king, you gotta swim through the ponds
