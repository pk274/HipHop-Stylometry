(if pirus and crips all got along
they'd probably gun me down by the end of this song
seem like the whole city go against me
every time i'm in the street, i hear—
yawk! yawk! yawk! yawk!
man down, where you from?
—who you know, where you from?
where your grandma stay, huh, my—?
this mad city i run—)

(rhythmic vocalizing)


35 summers in the making', stop fakin', you forgot about dre (alright)
35 summers in the makin', i'm talkin' n.w.a (alright)
35 summers in the makin', stop fakin', you forgot about dre (alright)
35 summers in the makin', i'm talkin' n.w.a (alright)
