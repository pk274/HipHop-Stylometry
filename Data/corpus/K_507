life in the city, life in the city
oakland, california, compton, california
but we survive
only the strongest survive
life, life in the city
in the city and nigga's tryna survive
only the strongest survive


you ever been a victim of being a prisoner inside your own mind?
the bright lights of the street lights will make you go blind
handicap your senses, you was just an apprentice of watching niggas jump fences
now you in the olympics and your hurdle was high enough to clear the tallest of clothes lines
talented when they closing in on your behind
life of a young delinquent, even stole him a lincoln
at fifteen, middle fingers walked out the precinct
i mean the cycle just continue
the vital information and fine print on the menu
so you'll never read it even if  a nigga lend you
money out my own pocket, to make it right
you'll still attend to
be on them corners with stop signs and a nine
cause nine times out of ten, mac 11's cry
and twelve died yesterday and if anyone divides
the six that carried you eventually lose they lives
true story
