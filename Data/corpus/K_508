now i done grew up 'round some people livin' their life in bottles
granddaddy had the golden flask
backstroke every day in chicago
some people like the way it feels
some people wanna kill their sorrows
some people wanna fit in with the popular, that was my problem
i was in a dark room, loud tunes
lookin' to make a vow soon
that i'ma get fucked up, fillin' up my cup, i see the crowd mood
changin' by the minute and the record on repeat
took a sip, then another sip, then somebody said to me


nigga, why you babysittin' only two or three shots?
i'ma show you how to turn it up a notch
first you get a swimming pool full of liquor, then you dive in it
pool full of liquor, then you dive in it
i wave a few bottles, then i watch 'em all flock
all the girls wanna play baywatch
i got a swimming pool full of liquor and they dive in it
pool full of liquor, i'ma dive in it

okay, now open your mind up and listen me, kendrick
i am your conscience
if you do not hear me, then you will be history, kendrick
i know that you're nauseous right now
and i'm hopin' to lead you to victory, kendrick
if i take another one down
i'ma drown in some poison, abusin' my limit
i think that i'm feelin' the vibe
i see the love in her eyes, i see the feelin'
the freedom is granted as soon as the damage of vodka arrived
this how you capitalize, this is parental advice
then apparently i'm over-influenced by what you are doin'
i thought i was doin' the most 'til someone said to me


nigga, why you babysittin' only two or three shots?
