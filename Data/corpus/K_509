now, i done grew up round some people livin' their life in bottles
granddaddy had the golden flask, backstroke every day in chicago
some people like the way it feel, some people wanna kill their sorrow
some people wanna fit in with the popular, that was my problem
i was in a dark room, loud tunes, lookin' to make a vow soon
that i'ma get fucked up, fillin' up my cup i see the crowd mood
changin' by the minute and the record on repeat
took a sip, then another sip, then somebody said to me

nigga, why you babysittin' only two or three shots?
i'ma show you how to turn it up a notch
first, you get a swimming pool full of liquor, then you dive in it
pool full of liquor, then you dive in it
i wave a few bottles, then i watch 'em all flock
all the girls wanna play baywatch
i got a swimming pool full of liquor and they dive in it
po-pool full of liquor, i'ma dive in it

okay, now open your mind up and listen me, kendrick
i am your conscience, if you do not hear me then you will be history, kendrick
i know that you're nauseous right now and i'm hopin' to lead you to victory, kendrick
if i take another one down, i'ma drown in some poison, abusin' my limit
i think that i'm feelin' the vibe, i see the love in her eyes
i see the feelin', the freedom is granted as soon as the damage of vodka arrived
this how you capitalize, this is parental advised, and apparently, i'm over-influenced
by what you are doin', i thought i was doin' the most 'til someone said to me

nigga, why you babysittin' only two or three shots?
i'ma show you how to turn it up a notch
first, you get a swimming pool full of liquor, then you dive in it

one chopper, one hundred shots, bang
hop out, do you bang?
two chopper, two hundred shots, bang
i ride, you ride, bang

sherane
sherane (pool—kendrick—kendrick—lies in it)
sherane, sherane
(w-watch 'em all flock) aw man…
sherane (girls wanna play-play-play)
where is she takin' me? (i got)
where is she takin' me? (pool full of liquor, i'ma die in...)


all i—all i—all i—
all i have in life is my new appetite for failure
and i got hunger pain that grow insane, tell me, do that sound familiar?
if it do, then you're like me, makin' excuse that your relief
is in the bottom of a bottle and the greenest indo leaf
as the window open, i release everything that corrode inside of me
i see you jokin', why you laugh? don't you feel bad? i prob'ly sleep
and never ever wake up, never ever wake up, never ever wake up
in god i trust, but just when i thought i had enough
