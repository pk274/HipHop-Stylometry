i can think of a million reasons, have it all as your seasons
say no more i feel ya b, say no more i feel ya homie
we traveled the neverlands, fireworks in the south of france
take it down and come again, again
but look
you don't get too dirty in my whip. whip, whip, whip
keep it nice and flirty in my whip, whip, whip whip
pop your pretty ass up in my whip, we gonna make it last up in my whip
scorpio, talk to me, talk to me
capricorn, talk to me, talk to me
