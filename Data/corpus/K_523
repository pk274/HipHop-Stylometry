i remember when it all started
on alondra in that small apartment
burgundy carpet and sega cartridges
pop a flick and blunt ashes all on the garments
momma of off wine cooler, magic johnson played jordan
i was only four, but it was like i heard it before
a house party cracking of the music the doctor recorded
and according to my awareness i was more than coherent
a cold listener, mocking that shit like a parrot
my cousins kicking up dust cripping
the flag, they wear it around their hand like a mitton
aiming use it for leverage
shitting on compton sheriffs like fuck the police
woofers and gold rollie's
every swap meet should know me
cause i copped every record that dropped
dropped the dub just to hear doc drop
a jewel for the sake of hip hop
who ever have thought the moment i see you bullets for cali love
fifteen years later you be saving my life, what
