murder 101, the hottest nigga under the sun
i come from another planet, holdin' that cannon
best believe i will dump 'til all of you vanish
blaw one to the throat, you ain't livin' no mo'
now you know i go harder than most
i'm on that pimpin' shit, take your bitch, guard your ho
and i don't give a shit, if i hit, long as she blow
just as much as a ref does a whistle
i got dimes, just multiply two nickels
from lisas to keishas down to nicoles
got they mind fucked up, they'd sell me their soul
y'all niggas should already know, i got hoes, boy
but you already know that, pimpin'
a baller slash killer like o.j. simpson
close to the mic like scottie pippen
superglue grip, i ain't ever slippin'

and i move with the coupe through traffic
real talk, homeboy, not just rappin'
with the tool, mami know that i practice
cause when i pull it out, i be shootin' it backwards
she like "damn, how you do that stuff?"
i said "don't worry, finish suckin' me up", oh fo' sho'
aye desire, they better act like they know what's up
before i send 'em to the heaven, let 'em know what's up, damn
oh yeah, i'm what people need
and i'm out of y'alls speed 'cause the flow got gas
yeah, our shit be the bomb
my suggest, you get your pom poms and cheer
i'm goin' down as the minor of the year
seventeen, fresh to death, clean, diamonds in my ear
play with me, have them triple beams aimin' at your rear
honestly, i'm the mothafucka that niggas fear

dave, man, put them niggas in the grave, man
fuck a pistol, let them niggas feel the k, man
i'm still gettin' that cake, man
'cause my uncle's still pitchin' rocks like a caveman
you snakes, stay far from my home
before i play nelly and get my desert eagle on
aim at your belly 'til you throw up your own shit
thinkin' you the shit, face in the toilet
you wanna witness the livest nigga existin'
then come and pay me a visit, you have to pay for admission
i'm on my mission to conquer my competition
my ego bigger than jay-z, for sure, not a maybe
i got the streets in a frenzy, dudes in the streets, they commend me
don't try to creep, i got semis and best believe they will empty
mix the juice with the remy got me feelin' so damn tipsy
just crashed in front of that bentley, smokin' blunts the bitch with me
she takin' shots in my gymmy, couple back shots i got plenty
tell her stop, she said gimme, y'all can see that i'm simply
