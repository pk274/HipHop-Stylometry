ayy, i am the truth
ayy, i am the wisdom of the fallen; i'm the youth
ayy, i am the greatest
ayy, this is the proof
ayy, i work hard, pray hard, pay dues, ayy
i transform with pressure, i'm hands-on with effort
i fell twice before, my bounce back was special
letdowns'll get you, and the critics'll test you
but the strong'll survive, another scar may bless you, ah


don't give up (no no), i won't give up (no no)
don't give up, no no no (nah)
don't give up, i won't give up
don't give up, no no no
