q, i wanna see you do your thang
entertainment business living limelight
hop on every track and move them trains
show these motherfuckers that you been tight, then they ever been
it's evident that you intelligent, but you can't escape that life
and for you, my nigga, i would sacrifice myself to make it just to see you hold the mic
and hit the stage and rock the set
but it's hard to change when your from the set
won't you think about it nigga, life or death
life of a cracker, iâ€™d like to hang you by the neck
do you wanna see the boys in jet, or you wanna see them runway jets?
fly to singapore, one way that, tell the pilot we got stacks on deck
swear to god, its hard out here for a young black man to live
if you don't do it for yourself, then please do it for your kids
my nigga, won't you tell michelle, i love your daughter?
please don't let her grow up life without a father
look at what you bought her, money couldn't buy
all she need is love, put that shit aside
at the same time, know they got to eat
know you got to hustle, make ends meet
gotta make time, gotta get a grind, gotta push the line, hgc, no a/c
got the block hot, you keep runnin', cops say "freeze"
blue pill, red pill, choose now, birds or the beez
birds or the beez
birds or the beez
