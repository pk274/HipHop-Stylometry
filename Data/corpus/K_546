watch her getting jumping like third grade barrettes
let the beretta blow you die slow while i smoke on chron-ic
try to throw salt homie like dry sweat gun powder flow through triceps
i'm more advanced got a corvette flow, i spit like murcielago
through precipitation i give rappers a sun tan
rapping like a promotional van when i pull the drum out
clap more than a beatle fan, never heard a sound like this
i'm number one, you're forever number two like siamese
this is new york rap on gold d's
jay rock proceed


expose niggas for who they are
under their white t might be halter tops
rap fags, the black mag come with a complimentary black mask
black jason, red beam on the glock
money talks, i'm trying to have a life long conversation
live like a silver spoon caucasian with a chain of hotel rooms across the nation
no home training, break 1,000,000 dollar vases
here we go yo, here we go yo
i got the special kind of flow they call it hip-hop antidote
murder mc's, if you're a rapper please check your pulse
(hurry up) too late
(flat line) john doe


new level hip hop

dig a couple graves tell 'em that the new rap zombie is alive to invade

going back to cali in a new york state of mind
