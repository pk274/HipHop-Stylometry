as i watch the sky change colors
the rain flooded the neighborhoods of the black brothers
the black mothers are stressing, the coroners have covered
another statistic, episodes of a cold summer
the street runners got the same legs of michael johnson
the fast life surpassed life beyond the conscience
profanity in the air, the children use the content
the vanity's in the air, that louis bag: haunted
the black girl with the hair, that's kind of coarse
her baby daddy's in court, she smoking on a newport
seventeen with dreams of becoming a stripper
or becoming an aids victim while touching them zippers
the life that we living in, things we would do just to live again
how can an angel forever live in sin?
