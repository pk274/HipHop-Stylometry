hol' up...but don't forget about compton, nigga!
one for the money, two for the show
three for no limit and the rest for death row
that means i been 'bout it 'bout it and this is the realest shit i ever wrote
and if anyone ever doubt it, then they are the loudest of liars i know
i only desire to blow, she only desire to blow
and i hope that my dick is a whistling flute
and that's not the instrumental
now pick up my coat
you let that motherfucker drag like rupaul
i'll drag your ass to the floor
bitch, i can admit, i'm a recovered addict, paraphernalia that is
telling the doctor i'm sick, head doctor, i'm needing your lips, yeah
proper analogy for it, if i can afford it, then i won't ignore it, clear
cop me a palace and porsche and right, when i floor it, that's when i switch gears
living my life on uranus, ugh, keeping one foot in your anus, ugh
the other foot all on your neck, repeatedly stomp 'til i break it, ugh
bitch i'm demanding respect, these bitches is telling me, "take it"
dj khaled, even if i had callus, holding the torch ain't no challenge, ain't it? ooh, huhuhu
