compton kendrick, something splendid
yeah i'm in this b-i-itch
no i.d., i be a g, exclude every other alphabet
every time i d.i.p., i need all of my ruffle chips
duffle bag full of frito lay, it'll be okay
don't call oj because i'm on some killer shit
k dot in his killer whip
k dot with his killer dime broadcasted on channel 9
lay back, let my seat recline
rolling like 2 miles per hour
i was with success, i don't know where y'all were
you see it's funny how i do this thing
throw 'em in the pond cause these pawns wish they knew this king
say they word is bond like double 07's service team
they be head servicing, get off my dick
i lay it down so cold, you would swore that i was half eskimo
in bucket seats below zero
oh it's me, i'm showing out, i get it crackin'
they never fill my void when i'm absent


every time i come through, through, through, through
they be on it so thirsty, thirsty
hoes they be boppin' so thirsty, thirsty
haters they be watching so thirsty
yeah, you too, too, too
you be on it so thirsty, thirsty
hoes they be boppin' so thirsty, thirsty
haters they be watching so thirsty
