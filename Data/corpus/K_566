tonight's the night i jump on my shh... uh huh?
lyrical mayhem, rappers get laid down when i kick
saliva k rounds, a transformer how i break down
nouns and verbs, you just stumble over your words
so in love with my shit they save it in pampers
the only pull ups be the drive by when i pull up then pull out
whatever you did shout i put up
then take the residuals after leaving your body in critical


living’ life crooked like a neck muscle after you pull it
187, look at the footage
like o-dawg, and oh you owe, dog? either pay up
or have your daughter makin’ that ransom phone call
player, i don’t tolerate niggas who fabricate stories
who says you did what (what?)
i’m sounding like noreaga for the paper
one leg to erase ya, kinda ironic
