once again it's on
i'm the youngest in charge, i am not playin'
i fear no man else than god
scatter your features, give you a face collage
not one, but two, i face menage
no hands involved, mommy would rather give a mouth massage
general, you can call me the sargeant
$7.45, five percent tip
i know i'm the shit, please hold the applaud
i spent summers writin' rhymes, winters freestylin'
daydreamin' gilligan thoughts on an island
i didn't develop, i was born with this talent
brain swell up, whenever you come to me you were the challenge
i need a way to balance street shit from the rap shit
stay on my toes, feet grounded to the souls of the dead
but still bulletholes surrounded the arc in my feet to the crown on my head
preach, listen how i pledge
i've been gettin' this money since you dummies were peein' in bed
to poppin' wheelies on handlebars and pegs
to poppin' big willy at the bar with bread
pause, it's real talk, i know you gotta crawl before you walk
shit, i decided to jog
i'm ten brains better than y'all
propane make emergency calls, whenever them boys speak
i fold niggas up, make both of the ends meet
you 'bout to fitness a lyrical fitness
this is what it'd sound like if god spoke over beats
i cash in my rap friends
peep the way i deliver, make you wanna tell your peeps
i consider that they learn from me
this is volcano hot, fuck a third degree
burn, you gotta be k-d-o-t


once again it's on, i am through with niggas
twin glocks, it'll shoot niggas
put you next to a plant, under a root nigga
hands folded together up in a suit nigga
this what we do nigga, run your mouth, we remote control mute niggas
matter of fact, i recruit niggas
