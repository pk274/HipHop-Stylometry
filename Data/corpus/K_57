(once again, top dawg e.n.t
compton, stand the fuck up
bo, k-dot
i see you)
drop 40 for the glock 40, that's a hood disc cop
that's an accessory gun, sesame seed buns for the beef y'all brung, y'all done fucked up
fuck with the wrong fuckup, i been a nut since, pops fucked moms
fucked up in the head, i'm living but i'm braindead
life goes on, and you don't need a psychic in order to read my palm
niggas will get you first where i'm from


that's why i creep on em
i creep on em
i creep on em
i creep on em
niggas play cold, put the heat on em
make the temperature reach the highest peak on em


i said you don't need a psychic in order to read my palm
you know what's in it, nigga, don't play stupid, you seen lifе's ending, nigga
you seen la movies beforе
pull up, pump out that red honda door
what's up? fuck nigga, i'm much quicker, on my toes like steroids through marrion jones's bones
for the camera, hammers, human home depot, not your car, rather, get your soul repo'd
backflip, tummy tuck, body fold, when i hit em up
shotty clog up arteries, part of me, but
you've gotta feel lost on me, bullets, burn, oh so awfully
and it's your turn, to feel the fabric of a body bag
357 kick back, that's karate class
get back, black ski mask, black gloves
let the burner spill on you, no "my bad"s, when


i creep on em (creep on em)
i creep on em (creep on em)

nigga play cold, put the heat on em
make the temperature reach the highest peak on em
homie, don't let me make the grim reaper breathe on em (breathe on em)
leave on em (leave on em)
gunpowder (gunpowder)
wet em up (creep on em)
no shower (creep on em)
one hour (creep on em)
you'll be dead (you'll be dead)


hit the chest, hit the neck, hit the head
taking off half his head, taking off, speeding off, sidewalks
code red, 187 said "hello", "goodbye"
uh oh, i tried, to tell em hard heads take soft naps, dead on arrival
that mean he had ambulance music to ride to
i ride to, 'me against the world', makaveli
got a chicken head, she my baby girl named desi
eagle, regal, pull up, pop out, circle round the block just to make the sequel
but this ain't a west crave flick
where i'm from, scary movies don't exist
compton, kill shit, die fast
hit the steering wheel, make the car crash
hit the light pole, black out the whole damn ave
i black out 3 k's, make the trunk drag
dump fast like a quick shit, no shit


i creep on em (creep on em)
i creep on em (creep on em)
i creep on em (creep on em)

sorry father, i gotta bother some of your children
some of your children gossip, too much, that's a problem
chew up any beef, aim it at any collars, homie we play for keeps
rifles coming with silencers, green army fatigue
war general, nigga, see the patch on my sleeve
see the stripe on my heart, been a pro from the start
i could hit my target eyes closed in the dark
you don't want no argument, park
your bad mouth 'fore i steal the car
cussing me out might get your life took, boy
look boy, better be bruce leroy, we seek & destroy with the vengeance, depending
on your sincerity, my, moment of clarity may be terminated
but your plea better be good or your moms might be devastated
put 3 inside his hood, he was transmission slipping when i


i creep on em (creep on em)
