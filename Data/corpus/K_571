baby, i wanna, i wanna get you to understand
i love you, and i love her too
but that may be too much for you to deal with
so i wrote a song about it, you wanna hear?
well, here we go


my life is mardi gras
and she's the life of the party, y'all
it's like ring around her rosy
when i came around, they chose me
and i make 'em feel famous, famous, famous, famous
winner circle, square don't fit
and i'm caught up in a triangle ship, no
living life in a triangle ship, no, no
and i'm caught up in a triangle ship, no
living life in a triangle ship, no, no
and i'm caught up in a triangle ship, no


my life is mardi gras
and she's the life of the party, y'all
it's like ring around her rosy
when i came around they chose me
and i make 'em feel famous, famous, famous, famous
winner circle, square don't fit
and i'm caught up in a triangle ship, no
living life in a triangle ship, no, no
and i'm caught up in a triangle ship, no
living life in a triangle ship, no, no
and i'm caught up in a triangle ship, no


my life is mardi gras
and she's the life of the party, y'all
it's like ring around her rosy
when i came around they chose me
and i make 'em feel famous, famous, famous, famous
winner circle, square don't fit
and i'm caught up in a triangle ship, no
living life in a triangle ship, no, no
and i'm caught up in a triangleship, no
living life in a triangle ship, no, no
and i'm caught up in a triangle ship, no
living life in a triangle ship, no, no
