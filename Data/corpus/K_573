back door, back door, east side, we go back door
what you wanna act for? you get what you ask for
ballin' in the game now, east side, we go back door
(east side, east side, east side, east side, east side)
nothing is the same now, motherfuck the task force
came up and i went back, changed up, never did that
if it's taped off, yeah i did that, blew a half a mil', yeah, i did that
on the blade, girl, is you with that? ten toes on the pavement
sell your soul in the days inn, shacked up like a caveman
troopers on deck, secure the bag, we plant the flags
so what we on next? what we on next?
rock bottom from the ng's, handguns on the ten speed
rip to my dead homies, loyalty is all we need, yeah
