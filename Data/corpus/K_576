kendrick martin, hootie malcolm
i'm screaming out peace
but his chopper piece a bad outcome


i'm vicious, and my house is a red light district
and my couch is a porno star, out of town from houston and memphis
and i never gave a fuck and i never did fuck with y'all so i kept my distance
just me and my day-ones, and a thousand ones for these strippers
ho i been on my own, get on the song then pee on the song
my bladder is gone, i shatter your dreams
i'm freddie it seems
my shadow is wearing expensive cologne
pigtails and dookie braids, cabinet full of kool-aid
i'm ghetto as fuck and my pedal is up
but i'm gassing on all of you niggas man

stale face, how come?
is it cause i do me? or your main bitch wanna do me?
face shots - we call it call of duty
k-dot now bitch give me two feet
made my bitch come give me two g's
raised by wolves and we do eat
play by rules and you might live
and i try to do this shit for the kids
but y'all got different prerogatives
and y'all rot in hell
and i dwell where the fortune live
and that's vicious
