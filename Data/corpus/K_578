i fucked up the rap game and you ain't even know it
i just fucked what's her name and you ain't even know it (you ain't even know it)
she got a *beep* tattoo and you ain't even know it (real talk)
we about to form a little group and you ain't even know it, let's get it
stuck in a rock and a hard place
eminem, pac and where god stay
timberlands pop that jaw bone
now bitch nigga, tell me how that tar taste
and even tarzan can get swung on
i never hung out with the loud mouth
you got a foul mouth
and that dead body gon' smell foul when it fouls out
she filed my nails in the bahamas
we found ourselves in the bahamas
she found god, meditation, and peace
i found myself without a condom
you know everybody having them babies
it's a beautiful thing it ain't crazy
if a rapper monogamous, you know what the problem is?
too many bitches got rabies
and i hate a ho-hoppin' woman
stank pussy-poppin' woman
you fuckin' fool don't know about you
but my dick need 17 years on it
anything after that is just a bonus
and i been in the lab with my opponents
and since sway done swayed that list
he got a flatscreen the next morning
tell 'em i need my credit when it's due
tell 'em i need my lettuce when it's new
tell 'em i got a fetish for fine fabric, franklins and saying, "fuck you"
tell 'em it's tde 'til i'm ddt'd in that grave
and top dawg is proof
'til my nigga whoo kid get free, ain't shit comin' for free
i'm 'bout to rape you niggas 'til you recoup
(dizzle)
