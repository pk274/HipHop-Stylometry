you walk around like everything is in control
favor come with favors and you can't say no
go out the way to make the coin available
that's what i call love
the closest ones afraid to say they need some time
the turnaround is life or death, but you don't mind
go out the way to say you made the compromise
that's what i call love

you say no and all you've done gives them amnesia
one thing i've learned, love can change with thе seasons


and i can't please еverybody
no, i can't please everybody
wait, you can't please everybody
no, i can't please everybody
i can't please everybody

but the time it'll come (but the time it'll come)
to not be there when somebody needs you (when somebody needs you)
