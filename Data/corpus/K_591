champagne problems
where's the connection if livin', what was this without him?
i've been a spinnin' soul for so long
i been double-dutchin' my thoughts
starin' at these venetian walls like asylums
save the right carry-ons, i was in hell
turbulence didn't pair well
my latest panic attack suffocated my damn self
tryna count to ten backwards
for the livin', the investmеnts
sweatin' religiously, moving all fidgety, my actions
got mе feeling caged in, days out, days in
paved in, my shoulder's 'bout to tip over
how many rounds i'm holdin', wait a minute
mama callin' me, she wrote all to me
doctor say my unc' got forty eight hours and his arteries turned it to twenty four
how can you hide the fact that you had cancer and i ain't even know?
now you tell me i gotta answer, like, right before the show?
i can't be competent, running from pressure
how can i hesitate to respond to shit?
i'm trying to consult with my mother
her younger brother was my twin
on my first album cover, we made history
i ascend generations of a newfound best
now i'm tryna fly his body back home before sound check
i'm on the phone with funeral homes
private banks and strangers
hoping to transfer $50k to start the arrangements
mama sent me a text, him in his final moments
life's
