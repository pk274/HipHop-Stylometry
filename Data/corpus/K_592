have you ever been punched in your motherfuckin' face?
what you say? oh, you haven't? alright, wait, bitch


have you ever been punched in your motherfuckin' face?
what you say? oh, you haven't? alright, wait, bitch


bless up, gotta change my number every week
enemigo, i got 'em hot, i got 'em greased
shut the fuck up, can't you see my daughter sleep?
shut the fuck up


servin' up a look, dancin' in the drought
"hello" to the rain man, never losin' count
ventin' in the safe house
ventin' in the safe house


can i vent all of my truth? i got nothin' to lose
i got problems in pools, i can swim in my faith
cameras movin', whenever i'm movin'
the family suin' whatever i make
murder his stackin', the president actin'
the government taxin' my funds in the bank
homies attracting the feds when i'm brackin'
look at my reaction, my pupils on skates (woah, woah)
everything jaded (jaded)
team on "go", let's get it (get it)
green gon' grow like veggie (veggie)
casino on my debit (debit)
fuck your rhetoric, fuck your leverage
chain no evidence, pass go, motherfuck confederate
flags on the back of the medicine
distributed and peddled in ghettos and
fuck your heritage, fuck your brainwash detergent
internet urgent, time travel in purges, every man and virgin
fuck chatterin' sermons
fuck your church propaganda, only god know the answer
we oblige in a copacetic manner
camouflage like a sheep, so we slide through the cancer
lies and deceit, vibe like a phantom
dodgin' police and paramedic retreats
wanna fuck y'all up for tellin' me "your life was the one i want"
been sellin' me concepts ever since i swung
from out of the pro tongue, dedicated myself for recreation
i rest my case, won


servin' up a look, dancin' in the drought
"hello" to the rain man, never losin' count
ventin' in the safe house
ventin' in the safe house
servin' up a look, dancin' in the drought
"hello" to the rain man, never losin' count
ventin' in the safe house
