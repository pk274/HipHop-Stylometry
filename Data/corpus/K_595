big money, big booty bitches
man, that shit gon' be death of me
big problems, i must admit it
man, that shit gon' be death of me
i pray to a c-note, my mama gave up hope
i can't stand myself
i just bought a new coat, i might go broke
i can't stand myself
big money, big booty bitches
man, that shit


turn me up
sin city, sin city
sin city, sin city


big money, big booty bitches
tell the truth, nigga, i'm lost without it
seven figures for a headline
you want some stage time? we can talk about it
niggas actin' like they be rappin'
like nice on the mic, truly doubt it
go against the kid, y'all don't wanna live
that decision is hella childish
rose gold for my old hoes
they ain't satisfied then i sit 'em down
10th grade, i gave her all shade
but now she got some ass, i wan' hit it now
i don't lease, i just all out feast
i put a blue caprice on gary coleman
bomb head and some cheese eggs
that's a new raise and a signing bonus


i got big money, big booty bitches
man, that shit gon' be death of me (death of me)
big problems, i must admit it
man, that shit gon' be death of me (death of me)
big dreams, no superstition
man, that shit gon' be death of me (death of me)
i pray to a c-note, my mama gave up hope
i can't stand myself
i just bought a new coat, i might go broke
i can't stand myself
i just might ban myself
i just might, god


i'm focused, feeling blessed
'cause my eyes be the truth (god!)
i'm focused, feeling blessed
'cause my eyes be the truth (mm)


i got big money, big booty bitches

i pray to a c-note, my mama gave up hope

i can't stand myself
i just might damn myself
i just might, god
