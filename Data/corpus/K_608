swallow your pride and then eat a dick, uh
make the rulers apologize, you ain’t ruling shit, uh
i’m rick rubin in ’85 with the beard thick
thick bitch, type peruvian, slanted eyes, that’s quench
they tell you that i’m one-up, from sundown to sunup
son, i son niggas, i probably fucked your mama
with no condom, that’s good pussy
pussy, tell it to your honor, this drama is jeffrey dahmer
it took me through many moons just to set up this new platoon
get ambushed or kick-pushed with push brooms
man, look, your man look like sweet water
cornbread that break under pressure if he caught up
big homie said “i gotta crawl before i walk
and if i ever run my mouth then my legs'll get cut off”
see, i’m just a young boss in the bat cave
back against the wall, and if i fall, gee watts bring it back, bang
