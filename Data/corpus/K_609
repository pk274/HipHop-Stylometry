how many souls do you touch a day?
how many hoes do you fuck a day?
how many flows do your thought convey?
how many know you can't walk away?
depending on the way i feel, i might kill everybody around me
might heal everybody around me, how the wind blow
open your window, let the debris in, never let me in
i kick back with kick do'
maybe if i could live hundred years that be real?
pay me if i'ma be rhymin' these homonyms
crazy, my other show went to my mom 'n' 'em
my daddy said a mercedes had haunted him
but now he got one, i'm ridin' shotgun
with a three-piece chicken dinner and shot gun
i bring your weekend to an ending and pop one
i'm in the deep end, boss nigga you not one
and i believe in kool-aid and god's son
do you believe that black man is our sun?
i made enough residuals to hide some
i gave enough, my niggas know i divide some
i told zay, i'm the best rapper since twenty-five
been like that for a while now, i'm twenty-nine
any nigga that disagree is a fuckin' liar
pardon me, see my alter ego was gemini
him and i been around ever since reagan was criticized
might stay in the trump tower for one week
spray paint all the walls and smoke weed
fuck them and fuck y'all and fuck me
i proceed my last check in proceeds
to all the kids, the hood, the bricks, the books
to fix the blocks we on to right my wrongs
the word, to give the life we live as i get...
