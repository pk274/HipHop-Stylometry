yeah, vigilante k. dot, feelin' antsy when i jump in the booth
top dawg, lick two shots
cameras off, this is pay-per-view, city of compton-bound
your fraternity die instantly on my stompin' grounds
code of the streets, eye for an eye
and only thing could come between that is a unibrow
you are now tuned into hieroglyphics, chips like macintosh
clips like a movie script
back off or i put tips on you like you strip
then make you strip like a chop shop, do your call
this is real as it gets
y'all will never exist once i journalist the current events
furnace, return and burn on your strip
burn a homie, got an umbilical cord to my hip
glock 40, double clip, plus a six-shooter
catch forty, bitch, black berry gordy
flip, shorty, pass him to the homies
half 'em lookin' for me, gave her good dick
