broadcasting live from compton california where foreigners never come mothers are worrisome and we dislike the governor
i hope these angels can cover us
if the lapd ain’t doing it then it was a cover up
coroners about to cover up everybody
i’m serious, every shotty is saw'd off
and every nigga is militant
and your gut like...what?
ebt cards, no credit can't ease cards
all my life beed og aw now my life on the billboard soon
give me room, i react like a wildebeest and
throw salt inside your wound your just diabetes to me
ain't shit sweet with these hotels homie
that crip shit got my uncle’s life in jail ho
so if i put the same line, they'll never forgive me
or worse than that the niggas right around the corner might kill me
i’m fighting back when it’s hard what
no barber my guards up, the author of fallen fathers that did it without much, this my house nigga
