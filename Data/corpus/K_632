watch how i kill them with the funky rhythm
embalming fluid fill 'em
piranha's in 'em
peep my persona as i
get deep as nostradamus
you stalling? like the '89 i-i-isiah thomas
i'm ballin', cut up your pajamas if you sleepin' on me
i promise no peekin' homie you tryin' to confiscate the flow, i know
so, i switch it quicker than my bitches in mini skirts that want your attention
one thing for sure, they gon' get it
i'm cursed with the world's negatives
probably thinkin' i'm hurt but that's the only way i can live
more money, cash, drugs, got me feeling like ace walking inside the club
paid in full, mob license plates
38's slug hugging my waist like it had arms
then i bear it so i guess it really does
no paper work on this marriage, but i'm in love with life corruptions rather than life (woah)


oh, you ain't know? i need that
more money, more drugs, i need that
more murder, more guns, i need that, wondering how i live with the world's negatives
this the last days, my nigga
we livin' in the life where crime pays, my nigga
so all i can say is get paid, my nigga
money, murder, or dope? which one you love most?


mamacita had a bangin' body
drove a black beamer, present from her baby daddy probably
he knew the nigga from high school
10th grade? they was cool, fell out over a dice game
she knew that but still wanted him to penetrate through that
shorty wait, me and your man go way back
she said so what? he don't need to know what go on between us besides, i just wanna fuck
she blew his mind
know what? we can exchange digits
lets hook up later pay one of them hotels a visit
she seemed more than interested, more like desperate to be intimate
either she this polite or his lucky night
got the champagne sittin' on ice
room 112, fuckin' all night then interrupted by her baby daddy and some niggas that he fuck with
got him for everything, pussy's a negative
adam & eve, he should've known


oh, you ain't know? he need that
more pussy, more hoes, he need that
even if it's dirty pussy, he need that, wondering how i live with the world's negatives
this the last days, my nigga
we livin' in the life where crime pays, my nigga
so all i can say is get paid, my nigga
money, murder, or dope? which one you love most?
we livin' in hell waiting on heaven but you don't know so
might as well try to accept it, go with the flow, oh
this life will never change (rather than try to fix it)
so i'm gonna do my thing (try to continue living)
seem's like we never see home, you know? so we screaming
this life will never change (rather than try to fix it)
so i'm gonna do my thing (try to continue living)


goes out to everybody that know about bad habits
and willing to accept them as a fatal attraction, what a reaction
rolling with the punches that life gives us and end up like ke$ha's
liver cirrhosis, matches givin' us cancer
bitches givin' us gono-rrhea
i promise to practice safe sex, momma, don't cry
they say the good die young but a crackhead live a long time
so i crack open a beer keg, take that bitch to the head
sippin' it slow hopin' it prolongs my soul
and that's crazy yo
when heat is on, i put on a coat
then take it off when it's about to get cold
i've adapted to my environment, murder and violence
20 years worth of it so i gotta love it, you can't blame me
negative energy, public pulled by evil string
as i open a bible i start to sing


this the last days, my nigga
we livin' in the life where crime pays, my nigga
so all i can say is get paid, my nigga
money, murder, or dope? which one you love most?
we livin' in hell waiting on heaven but you don't know so
might as well try to accept it, go with the flow, oh
this life will never change (rather than try to fix it)
so i'm gonna do my thing (try to continue living)
seem's like we never see home, you know? so we screaming
this life will never change (rather than try to fix it)
so i'm gonna do my thing (try to continue living)
