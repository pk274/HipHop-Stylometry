what up? lemme catch the beat
what up? swag, swag, based god, i hear you
what up? swag, swag, yeah, g shit
westside, huh, look


i'm beyond the most slept on, stepped on
stepsons, father of rap songs, writing my wrongs
writing in the book of psalms, this is the word
word to the holy qur'an or whatever that's foreign to ya
i find it funny that you are embracing a storm, wait
ring the alarm or wake up with a bomb through ya
it's baghdad kids with bad dads, cops with bad badges
big bullets, no "my bads" once them guns shoot ya
i said, "yo, i might go hard as the mike jordan
lace up my jordans and yellin' out iso"
ike turner your idol, whip 'em and bruise 'em
stick poison inside his pie-hole, sad that you knew him
we influence the heart of thousands
nine-hundred-and-ninety-nine-thousand, but who's counting?
thirsty for success and we drink from the youth fountain
big headed, tryna stay grounded like a delinquent in middle school clownin'
drownin' mcs, they want life jackets
while we swim backwards, we yellin' "nigga, please!"
pay your respect or recognize the alphabet
you can't survive in a room full of gs
coached by my uncle, lil mane, i resemble him
they tryna tilt the game and we killing all thebes
make 'em all blood, make 'em all bleed
motherfucker die, put a ribbon in the sky
'til stevie wonder sing, king of all kings
jokers and new jacks can get dealt with
royal flush when i drop shit and say these things
mad leaning on 'em 'cause half of these niggas maybelline
all made up, 'bout to go dummy
on a dummy, what, what, treat him like a welterweight
and stuff him in some trunks, you fucking with a giant
i'm forest whitaker sparring with some forrest gumps
what you want?


cyhi, let's get it (yeah, yeah)
good music, ha-ha (yeah, yes sir)
