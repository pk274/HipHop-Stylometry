i got power, poison, pain, and joy inside my dna
i got hustle, though, ambition flow inside my dna
i was born like this, since one like this, immaculate conception
i transform like this, perform like this, was yeshua new weapon
i don't contemplate, i meditate, then off your fucking head

yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, soldier’s dna (i’m a soldier's dna)
born inside the beast, my expertise checked out in second grade
when i was 9, on cell, motel, we didn’t have nowhere to stay
at 29, i've done so well, hit cartwheel in my estate
and i'm gon' shine like i’m supposed to, antisocial extrovert
and excellent mean the extra work

i live a better life, i'm rollin' several dice, fuck your life
i-i got loyalty, got royalty inside my dna
i live a be-, fuck your life
five, four, three, two, one
this is my heritage, all i'm inheritin'
money and power, the mecca of marriages

tell me somethin'
you mothafuckas can't tell me nothin'
i'd rather die than to listen to you
my dna not for imitation
your dna an abomination
this how it is when you in the matrix
dodgin' bullets, reapin' what you sow
and stackin' up the footage, livin' on the go
and sleepin' in a villa
sippin' from a grammy, walkin' in the buildin'
diamond in the ceilin', marble on the floors
beach inside the window, peekin' out the window
baby in the pool, godfather goals
only lord knows i've been goin' hammer
dodgin' paparazzi, freakin' through the cameras
eat at four daughters, brock wearin' sandals
yoga on a monday, stretchin' to nirvana
watchin' all the snakes, curvin' all the fakes
phone never on, i don't conversate
i don't compromise, i just penetrate
sex, money, murder—these are the breaks
these are the times, level number nine
look up in the sky, ten is on the way
sentence on the way, killings on the way
motherfucker, i got winners on the way
you ain't shit without a body on your belt
you ain't shit without a ticket on your plate
you ain't sick enough to pull it on yourself
you ain't rich enough to hit the lot and skate
tell me when destruction gonna be my fate
gonna be your fate, gonna be our faith
peace to the world, let it rotate
sex, money, murder—our dna
