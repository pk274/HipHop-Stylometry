pray to the omega, pglang, rollie gang, sie
don't you address me unless it's with four letters (g.o.a.t.)
i thought you'd known better
i been duckin' the pandemic, i been duckin' the social gimmicks
i been duckin' the overnight activists, yeah
i'm not a trending topic, i'm a prophet
i answer to metatron and gabriel (ah, ah, ah)
bitch, ain't no discrepancies
i am a legacy, i come from the '70s
the al green offspring, guns and the melody
the big shot, wrist on cryotherapy
soon as i press that button
nigga better get right like the ambulance comin'
us two ain't alike, he ain't been through nothin'
dave free got at least one b in the oven
i'm trippin', i'm juggin', my mental isâ€”
amazing, brother
pop out, only on occasions, brother
rich nigga, round caucasian, brother
go figure, never caught cases, brother
gracious, brother, face it, brother
new flows comin', be patient, brother
show my ass and take y'all to class, i can multitask like megan, brother
pause
2021, i ain't takin' no prisoners
last year, y'all fucked up all the listeners
who went platinum? i call that a visitor
who the fuck backin' 'em? it's all been falsified
the facts mean this is a vaccine and the game need me to survive
the elohim, the rebirth
before you get to the father, you gotta holla at me first, bitch
