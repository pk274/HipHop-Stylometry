uh, i want to press my like, yeah, i wanna press my
i want a green light, i wanna be like
i wanna press my line, yeah
i wanna take that ride, yeah
i'm gonna press my line
i want a green light, i wanna be like, i wanna press myâ€”
mama dearest, spare your feelings
i'm relivin' moments, peelin' more residual
i can buy the buildin', burn the buildin'
take your bitch, rebuild the buildin' just to fuck some more
i can justify my love for ya
and touch the sky for god to stop debating war
put the pussy on a pedestal (ayy)
put the pussy on a high horse
that pussy to die for
that pussy to die for
peter piper picked a pepper
so i could pick your brain and put your heart together
we depart the shady parts and party hard
the diamonds yours, the coupe forever
my best shot just might shoot forever like (brr)
