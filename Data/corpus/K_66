too many opinions in the glass house
this world, i don't know no mo' need to cash out


bless up
i'm him, i don't care
i'm him, i don't care
i do what makes me happy
that's why i'm alone
it makes me happy
i don't pick up the phone
it makes me happy
bless up
i know you don't care
i know you don't care, but do it make you happy?
i see that you're home, but are you happy?
tell me if i'm wrong
i want you happy


i fall through, nausy
i count the body
stats on black mamba
crown on, bob marley
wrist on yo gotti
fox
ma' don't you call me
too late for sorry
your life like ‘the truman show’
likes on your ig
that don't mean they like you though
i'm careful bout who i know
i ducked the party, who said they saw me?


make it look easy
i need my issue, better believe me
green man!
all in my pocket, talkin' luigi
fuck all the gas
what's up with the play, whats up with the cash?
eyes on you, but if it ain't real, i gotta ask


i say, bless up
i'm him, i don't care
i'm him, i don't care
i do what makes me happy
that's why i'm alone
it makes me happy
i don't pick up the phone
it makes me happy
bless up
i know you don't care
i know you don't care, but do it make you happy?
i see that you're home, but are you happy?
tell me if i'm wrong


it's a new year comin' in
and i'ma make a vow tonight (wait)
i won't leave stressed out tonight (wait)
it won't be no let-downs tonight (wait)
ain't no well, wish it loud tonight
let downs tonight


bless up
i'm him, i don't care
i'm him, i don't care
i do what makes me happy
that's why i'm alone
it makes me happy
i don't pick up the phone
it makes me happy
bless up
i know you don't care
i know you don't care, but do it make you happy?
i see that you're home, but are you happy?
tell me if i'm wrong
i want you happy
