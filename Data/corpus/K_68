living in a premature place, wait
never grow to see the pearly gates, break
every time a bullet detonate, dates
of obituary carry crates
of a scary picture with a family member that relate to ya
in december you was finna pin another case
on your record in a stolen expedition, play it safe
as the record spinning, you was hearing angels entertain
every pun intended, that was wicked, coming from your brain
recognize you listened and you didn't hit the block again
that's because the minute after you had knew you would be slain
open up another chapter in the book and read 'gain
story of a gun-clapper really tryna make a change
everybody ain't blessed, my nigga
yes, my nigga, you're blessed, take advantage, do your best, my nigga
don't stress, you was granted everything inside this planet
anything you imagine, you possess, my nigga
you reject these niggas that neglect your respect
for the progress of a baby step, my nigga
step-step my nigga, one, two, skip-skip
back-back, look both ways, pull it off the hip
blast at anybody say that you can't flip
this crack into rap music every other zip is a track
get used to it, get it off quick
come back, give back to the city you've built
that's that, don't trip, see money, fuck niggas, dog
it ain't nothing but a bunch of fuck niggas, dog
in a minute everybody gon' be winning
put a little faith in it then recognize that we all
