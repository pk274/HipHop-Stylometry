this is for my everyday young nigga
it don't really matter where you from niggas
before you leave the house, kiss your moms nigga
cause you don't know when that day'll come nigga
cause only lord knows that i know how you feel
what we gotta do just to live
is try not to get our cap peeled, try not to get your cap peeled
