so i was takin' a walk the other day
and i seen a woman—a blind woman
pacin' up and down the sidewalk
she seemed to be a bit frustrated
as if she had dropped somethin' and
havin' a hard time findin' it
so after watchin' her struggle for a while
i decide to go over and lend a helping hand, you know?
"hello, ma'am, can i be of any assistance?
it seems to me that you have lost something
i would like to help you find it"
she replied, "oh, yes, you have lost something
you've lost… your life"
*gunshot*
