a better way to make a wave, stop defendin' them
i meditate and moderate all of my wins again
i'm hangin' on the fence again

i put my lyric and my lifeline on the line
and ain't no limit when i might shine, might grind

tell me who you loyal to
is it money? is it fame? is it weed? is it drink?
is it comin' down with the loud pipes in the rain?
big chillin', only for the power in your name
tell me who you loyal to
is it love for the streets when the lights get dark?
is it unconditional when the 'rari don't start?
tell me when your loyalty is comin' from the heart


tell me who you loyal to
do it start with your woman or your man? (mmm)
do it end with your family and friends? (mmm)
are you loyal to yourself in advance?
i said, tell me who you loyal to
is it anybody that you would lie for?
anybody you would slide for?
anybody you would die for?
that's what god for
