this feelin' is unmatched
this feelin' is brought to you by adrenaline and good rap
black pendleton ball cap (west, west, west)
we don't share the same synonym, fall back (west, west, west)
been in it before internet had new acts
mimicking radio's nemesis made me wack (ooh-ooh)
my innocence limited, the experience lacked
ten of us with no tentative tactic that cracked
the mind of a literate writer, but i did it, in fact (yeah)
you admitted it once i submitted it, wrapped in plastic
remember scribblin', scratchin' diligent sentences backwards
visiting freestyle cyphers for your reaction
now, i can live in a stadium, pack it the fastest
gamblin' benjamin benefits, sinnin' in traffic
spinnin' women in cartwheels, linen fabric on fashion
winnin' in every decision, kendrick is master that mastered it
isn't it lovely how menaces turned attraction?
pivotin' rappers, finish your fraction while writing blue magic
thank god for rap
i would say it got me a plaque, but what's better than that?
the fact it brought me back home


i know everything
i know everything, know myself
i know morality, spirituality, good and bad health
i know fatality might haunt you
i know everything
i know compton, i know street shit,i know shit that's conscious
i know everything, i know lawyers, advertisement and sponsors
i know wisdom, i know bad religion, i know good karma
i know everything, i know history
i know the universe works mentally
i know the perks of bullshit isn't meant for me
i know everything, i know cars, clothes, hoes, and money
i know loyalty, i know respect, i know those that's ornery
i know everything, the highs, the lows, the groupies, the junkies
i know if i'm generous at heart, i don't need recognition
the way i'm rewarded—well, that's god's decision
i know you know that line's for compton school district
just give it to the kids, don’t gossip 'bout how it was distributed
i know how people work
i know the price of life, i'm knowin' how much it’s worth
i know what i know, and i know it well not to ever forget
until i realized i didn’t know shit, the day i came home


i met a little boy that resembled my features
nappy afro, gap in his smile, hand-me-down sneakers
bounced through the crowd
run a number on man and woman that crossed him
sun beamin' on his beady beads, exhausted
tossin' footballs with his ashy, black ankles
breakin' new laws, mama passed on home trainin'
he looked at me and said, "kendrick, you do know my language
you just forgot because of what public schools had painted"
oh, i forgot, "don't kill my vibe," that's right, you're famous
i used to watch on channel 5, tv was taken
but never mind, you're here right now, don't you mistake it
it's just a new trip, take a glimpse of your family ancestor
make a new list of everything you thought was progress
and that was bullshit, i know your life is full of turmoil
spoiled by fantasies of who you are, i feel bad for you
i can attempt to enlighten you without frightenin' you
if you resist, i'll back off quick, go catch a flight or two
but if you pick destiny over rest-in-peace
then be an advocate, tell your homies, especially
to come back home"


this is a world premiere (this is a world premiere)
this is a world premiere (this is a world premiere)
this is a world premiere


i say, where you at? from the front to the back
i'm lookin' for you, i react only when you react
ah, i thought i found you, back in the ghetto
when i was seventeen with the .38 special
maybe you're in a dollar bill, maybe you're not real
maybe only the wealthy get to know how you feel
maybe i'm paranoid, ha, maybe i don't need you anyway
don't lie to me, i'm suicidal anyway
i can be your advocate
i can preach for you if you tell me what the matter is
