you did me wrong, you put me down
made me feel low when you're around
and you broke my heart, you broke my heart
my chips went down, it was you i needed
but i was not down, baby, barely breathin'
and you broke my heart
you broke my heart


livin' a double life, havin' double shots of patrón
with my mistress 'stead of my wife, i was on
like the switch in my marriott, can we get married, dot?'
i fucked her three times, then i was gone, apparently not
story of the 80–20 rule is me
movin' cautiously, parked in the park with my back seat
way back, her perfume on my white tee
ignorin' calls from my wifey
see, i was dead wrong, but was tryin' to get a nut
and she had some great dome
like the new orleans saints when they're playin' at home
what's a nigga to think? oh, just throw away some pussy
then my conscious called me, 'pussy'
you don't understand, mama had ass
and i'm quite a butt man, i love my wife, but, man...
i never thought of the day i would quit
till i opened the door, seen a nigga fuckin' my bitch


you did me wrong, you put me down
made me feel low when you're around
and you broke my heart, you broke my heart
my chips went down, it was you i needed
but i was not down, baby, barely breathin'
and you broke my heart
you broke my heart
