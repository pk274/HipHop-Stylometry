now, i was raised on the wild side
ever since a child
i 'member food stamps when mama said it's child time
papa had the green seville
with the alpine woofer in the back, doggystyle, track number 9
lifestyles of a lil' nappy head
guns in the closet, bills in the bed
watchin' jay-z on bet countin' bread
pointed at him then i said


man, you ain't gettin' money without me (no, no, no)
nigga, you ain't gettin' money without me (no, no, no)
somebody tell puff he ain't gettin' money without me (no, no, no)
you ain't gettin' money without me (no, no, no, no, no, no)
and you can talk about it, imma be about it (woah, woah)
you can talk about it, imma be about it (woah, ay, woah)
you can talk about it, imma be about it (woah, woah)
you can talk about it, imma be about it (woah, ay, woah)
you can talk about it, imma be about it (woah, woah)
you can talk about it, imma be about it (woah, ay, woah)
you can talk about it, imma be about it (woah, woah)
you can talk about it, imma be about it


no brakes on my gt, they know i'm gone in the wind
i'm on a mission and my ambition won't let me see you again
no time for the bullshit, fake smiles and fake friends
i progressed and left stress alone, now i'm on cloud 10
i'm so sick and tired living the same life
being sick and tired, looking at your life
steady wondering why my new 600 never sitting outside
behind new whips coming soon as i blind myself quick
i don't have it now but i know it exists
the day i meet oprah, tap her on the shoulder
then i tell her this


lady, you ain't gettin' money without me (no, no, no)
you ain't gettin' money without me (no, no, no)
somebody tell dre he ain't gettin' money without me (no, no, no)
nigga, you ain't gettin' money without me (no, no, no, no, no, no)
and you can talk about it, imma be about it (woah, woah)
you can talk about it, imma be about it (woah, ay, woah)
you can talk about it, imma be about it (woah, woah)
you can talk about it, imma be about it (woah, ay, woah)
you can talk about it, imma be about it (woah, woah)
you can talk about it, imma be about it (woah, ay, woah)
you can talk about it, imma be about it (woah, woah)
you can talk about it, imma be about it
