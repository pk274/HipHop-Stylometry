i feel like a chip on my shoulders
i feel like i'm losin' my focus
i feel like i'm losin' my patience
i feel like my thoughts in the basement
feel like, i feel like you're miseducated
feel like i don't wanna be bothered
i feel like you may be the problem
i feel like it ain't no tomorrow, fuck the world
the world is endin', i'm done pretendin'
and fuck you if you get offended
i feel like friends been overrated
i feel like the family been fakin'
i feel like the feelings are changin'
feel like my thought of compromise is jaded
feel like you wanna scrutinize how i made it
feel like i ain't feelin' you all
feel like removin' myself, no feelings involved
i feel for you, i've been in the field for you
it's real for you, right? shit, i feel likeâ€”


ain't nobody prayin' for me
ain't nobody prayin' for me
ain't nobody prayin' for me
ain't nobody prayin'


i feel niggas been out of pocket
i feel niggas tappin' they pockets
i feel like debatin' on who the greatest can stop it
i am legend, i feel like all of y'all is peasants
i feel like all of y'all is desperate
i feel like all it take is a second to feel like
mike jordan whenever holdin' a real mic
i ain't feelin' your presence
feel like i'ma learn you a lesson
feel like only me and the music though
i feel like your feelin' ain't mutual
i feel like the enemy you should know
feel like the feelin' of no hope
the feelin' of bad dope
a quarter ounce manipulated from soap
the feelin', the feelin' of false freedom
i'll force-feed 'em the poison that fill 'em up in the prison
i feel like it's just me
look, i feel like i can't breathe
look, i feel like i can't sleep
look, i feel heartless, often off this
feelin' of fallin', of fallin' apart with
darkest hours, lost it
fillin' the void of bein' employed with ballin'
streets is talkin', fill in the blanks with coffins
fill up the banks with dollars
fill up the graves with fathers
fill up the babies with bullshit
internet blogs and pulpit, fill 'em with gossip
i feel like this gotta be the feelin' where 'pac was
the feelin' of an apocalypse happenin'
but nothin' is awkward, the feelin' won't prosper
the feelin' is toxic, i feel like i'm boxin' demons
monsters, false prophets schemin'
sponsors, industry promises
niggas, bitches, honkies, crackers, compton
church, religion, token blacks in bondage
lawsuit visits, subpoena served in concert
fuck your feelings, i mean this for imposters
i can feel it, the phoenix sure to watch us
i can feel it, the dream is more than process
i can put a regime that forms a loch ness
i can feel it, the scream that haunts all logic
i feel like sayin' somethin', i feel like takin' somethin'
i feel like skatin' off, i feel like waitin' for 'em
maybe it's too late for 'em
i feel like the whole world want me to pray for 'em
but who the fuck prayin' for me?


ain't nobody prayin' for me
who prayin' for me?
ain't nobody prayin'
