uh
walkin' through the city, i
carry feelings with me, i
some of them is full of holes, some of them is empty, i
some of them is splendid souls, dedicated genocide
solution, nobody knows, point the finger, close your eyes
i jump on the mirror ways, and throw all my friends away
just for you to reciprocate and trust in me sincerely
role model ain't no model if there's only a frame
it's what's inside, that heart following love in those veins
i still see child in me, that's my only vile in me
therefor me is just like you, we both young, wild, and free
what i feed off, you feed off, and the whole world can see y'all
i see y'all as my little brother, could evolve, we evolve like
