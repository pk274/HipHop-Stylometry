nigga do that shit, nigga done that shit
nigga any problem, bet i overcome that shit
twenty gold bottles i'ma drink on that shit
twenty songs that i'm on, number one that shit
my name gon' ring and my team gon' win
i shot a nigga once, and i'd do that shit again
put your hands on a bible stealing candy at a store
to a black homicidal it's the same damn sin
drop down, give me three points ho
k. dot, give it to it how you want ho
i'ma show you what this west side about
i'ma pull up in a 'rari at your grandmama's house, hey now
she got a nigga name in her mouth, hey now
t-o to n-o to ammo, i mean
my mo is zero, see commas, i promise

this dick ain't, this dick ain't
this dick ain't, this dick ain't
this dick ain't for free
touch that, i need cash back, transaction
i bust back in a all black grand national
hoodrats in the project if you ask 'em
they wanna buy the world, 10 racks on they taxes
holiday cheers, sallie mae checks
with a bottle to the neck, get it how you live it


i say hol up (hey!)
i just wanna ball like them grown ups (hey!)
tell em catch me if they can
i switch gears then switch lanes
you know just what my mind's on these days
keep singin' with me
i say, "hol' up" (hey!)
we just wanna ball like them grown ups (hey!)
tell em catch me if they can
i switch gears then switch lanes
you know just what my mind's on these days
