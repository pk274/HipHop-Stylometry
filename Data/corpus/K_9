now here we go again, from the bed to the floor again
i hear your phone on vibrate and i know it's him
but that's what happens when that kitty's in the lion's den
you start lying and changing places
you might've been, i might've been too aggressive
but it was far from desperate
i mean, the swag i got, just know it's half the effort
they tryin' to toot my own horn
but, shit, i sworn that i swarmed up in it, stamped and fingerprint it
left the coupe tinted when you played the passenger
don't be passing up 'til we finish
what we started, you with it? i'm with it
then lay your seat way back like it was vintage
while i hit the highway and slowly puff on this spinach
camouflage emotions got your feelings wide open
i'm hoping you come to grips
at least before you provoke 'em to trip
but that's inevitable, and if i put you on a pedestal
that means i'm fuckin' you on a chair
