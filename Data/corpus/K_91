i wanna hit line drives…
wanna lose weight and keep eating…
for you…
hey, whats up doc?


now i was raised in a sandbox, next to you and her
you was holding the handgun, she was giving birth
to a baby boy to be just like you, i-i wonder what's that worth
i-i wonder if you ever knew that you was a role model to me first
the next day i-i woke up in the morning, seen you on the news
looked in the mirror, then realized that i-i-i had something to prove
you told me, "don't be like me, just finish watching cartoons"
which is funny now cause all i see is wile e. coyotes in the room


and i run it (blow! blow! blow! blow!)
and i run it (blow! blow! blow! blow!)
and i run it (yeah! blow!)
and i run it (yeah! blow!)
that's ironic (blow! blow! blow! blow!)
ironic (blow! blow! blow! blow!)
that's ironic (y-yeah!  blow!)
ironic (yeah! blow! yeah!)
salt all in my wounds
hear my tears all in my tunes
let my life loose in this booth
just for you, mothafucka, hope y'all amused
and i run it (blow! blow! blow! blow!)
and i run it (blow! blow! blow! blow!)
and i run it (y-yeah! blow!)
and i run it (yeah! blow!)
that's ironic


liberation… leader…
popular pie plant pictured here…
wile e. coyote! wile e. coyote!

this shit make a nigga just wanna write
reminisce when i had the morning appetite
apple jacks and after that i hit the tv guide
animaniac the only thing that gave me peace of mind
i’m a maniac when aiming at the enemy that lied
tell a story that i'll never grow to 25
not to worry, every warrior will come and see euphoria
and that's a covenant i put on every tribe
ain't nobody gon' tie your shoe
nobody gon' abide by your rule
nobody holding your gun
how come your tongue say, "killa" then kill my mood
light speed living in the world you know
little old me, feeling like a live wire
bet i put some new tires on a lightning bolt
'til i wreck into a pole, like a right to vote
i'm from the bottom of the jungle
living in the bottom of the food chain
when you get a new chain, nigga take it from you
a new name, want stripes, and you a zebra look-alike
hope another homicide don't numb you a nun do
things we will never learn soon
in the era where we wanna earn soon
that's a error, you can smell it in the air
and everybody really doomed
that's why i'm backdooring you motherfuckas
all y'all can suck my dick
all them days at the county building
i'm 'bout to make my mama rich
cartoons and (cereal!) i ain't felt this (good since!)
scrooge mcduck (here we go!), elementary hood shit


now i was raised in a sandbox, next to you and her
you was holding the handgun, she was giving birth
to a baby boy to be just like you, i wonder what's that worth
i-i wonder if you ever knew that you was a role model to me first

and i run it (blow! blow! blow! blow!)
and i run it (blow! blow! blow! blow!)
and i run it (yeah! blow!)
and i run it (yeah! blow!)
that's ironic (blow! blow! blow! blow!)
ironic (blow! blow! blow! blow!)
that's ironic (y-yeah!  blow!)

this shit make a nigga just wanna shit on everybody
even with a pot to piss in
i'ma aim sloppy at a loud mouth, discharge
dismiss any business of yours
discounts never did amount to a check
that ya ass couldn't cash when the shit bounce
everything dismounts, niggas gon' flip that car
aks for the whole hood
house lick went down perfect
two shots to the head he deserved it
i overheard it hit my bed with a bowl and remote control
dark wing duck lost service
mama said i'd better duck, she's nervous
drama all up in the cut, hit the curtains
i mean don't intervene with no gun machine
this block stay jerking, the feds stay lurkin'
emerging on everbody corner (dash for it)
get a toe tag when you play tag
with a task of a new (task force)
everybody wanna know my life
how did i make it (past yours)
well let me tell you like this
i've been running this shit since i (asked for)
cartoons and cereal


now i was raised in a sandbox, next to you and her
you was holding the handgun, she was giving birth
to a baby boy to be just like you, i wonder what's that worth
i-i wonder if you ever knew that you was a role model to me first
the next day i-i woke up in the morning, seen you on the news
looked in the mirror, then realized that i-i-i had something to prove
you told me, "don't be like me, just finish watching cartoons"
which is funny now cause all i see is wile e. coyotes in the room
and i run it
