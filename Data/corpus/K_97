ah, ah


loving you is complicated, loving you is complicated
loving you is complicated, loving you is complicated
loving you is complicated, loving you is complicated
loving you is complicated, loving you is complicated
loving you is complicated, loving you is complicated


i place blame on you still, place shame on you still
feel like you ain't shit, feel like you don't feel
confidence in yourself, breakin' on marble floors
watchin' anonymous strangers, tellin' me that i'm yours
but you ain't shit, i'm convinced your tolerance nothin' special
what can i blame you for? nigga, i can name several
situations, i'll start with your little sister bakin'
a baby inside, just a teenager, where your patience?
where was your antennas?
where was the influence you speak of?
you preached in front of 100,000 but never reached her
i fuckin' tell you, you fuckin' failure—you ain't no leader!
i never liked you, forever despise you—i don't need you!
the world don't need you, don't let them deceive you
numbers lie too, fuck your pride too, that's for dedication
thought money would change you
made you more complacent
i fuckin' hate you, i hope you embrace it
i swear—


loving you is complicated, loving you is complicated
loving you is complicated, loving you is complicated
loving you is complicated, loving you is complicated
loving you is complicated, loving you is complicated
loving you is complicated, loving you is complicated


lovin' you, lovin' you, not lovin' you, 100° proof
i can feel your vibe and recognize that you're ashamed of me
yes, i hate you, too


you the reason why mama and them leavin'
no, you ain't shit, you say you love them
i know you don't mean it
i know you're irresponsible, selfish, in denial, you can't help it
your trials and tribulations a burden, everyone felt it
everyone heard it, multiple shots, corners cryin' out
you was deserted, where was your antennas again?
where was your presence?
where was your support that you pretend?
you ain’t no brother, you ain’t no disciple
you ain’t no friend
a friend never leave compton for profit
or leave his best friend, little brother
you promised you’d watch him before they shot him
where was your antennas?
on the road, bottles and bitches
you facetimed him one time, that's unforgiven
you even facetimed instead of a hospital visit
guess you thought he would recover well
third surgery, they couldn't stop the bleeding for real
then he died, god himself will say, "you fuckin' failed"
you ain't try


now, baby, when i get you, get you, get you, get you
i'ma go hit the throttle with you
smoking, lokin', poking that doja 'til i'm idle with you
'cause i (want you)
now, baby, when i'm riding here, i'm riding dirty
registration is out of service
smoking, lokin', drinking that potion, you can see me swerving
'cause i (want you)
(i want you more than you know)


i remember you took me to the mall last week, baby
you looked me in my eyes about four, five times
'til i was hypnotized, then you clarified
that i (want you)
you said sherane ain't got nothing on lucy
i said, "you crazy?"
roses are red, violets are blue
but me and you both pushing up daisies if i (want you)


now, baby, when i get you, get you, get you, get you
i'ma go hit the throttle with you
smoking, lokin', poking that doja 'til i'm idle with you


you said to me
you said your name was lucy
i said, "where's ricardo?"
you said, "oh, no, not the show"
then you spit a little rap to me like this
when i turned twenty-six, i was like, "oh, shit"
you said to me
i remember what you said too, you said
"my name is lucy, kendrick
you introduced me, kendrick
usually i don’t do this
but i see you and me, kendrick
lucy give you no worries
lucy got million stories
about these rappers that i came after when they was boring
lucy gon' fill your pockets
lucy gon' move your mama out of compton
inside the gi-gantic mansion like i promised
lucy just want your trust and loyalty
avoiding me?
it's not so easy, i'm at these functions accordingly
kendrick, lucy don't slack a minute
lucy work harder
lucy gon' call you even when lucy know you love your father
i'm lucy
i loosely heard prayers on your first album, truly
lucy don't mind, 'cause at the end of the day you'll pursue me
lucy go get it, lucy not timid, lucy up front
lucy got paperwork on top of paperwork
i want you to know that lucy got you
all your life i watched you
and now you all grown up to sign this contract if that’s possible"


now, baby, when i get you, get you, get you, get you
