when the sun fall out the sky
all i have is me in the land of do or die
a freeway, a gas pedal, and a peace of mind
now, that's the ultimate high
to the cloud i go, cloud i go
one time, baby tell me ya need me
cloud i go, cloud i go
two time, baby tell me ya love me


cause i've been drinking too much, thinking too much
we ain't been keeping in touch
fell into lust, where is the love?
my independency got tendencies of lack of trust
i look at the street corners as my new woman
seductive as she want to be, hands all on my garments
and luckily, being in denial ain't the case
cause i know she's unfaithful
instead i'm grabbing her waist
and every part of her is tasteful
and i know you're feelings hating
in fact, you think i'm ungrateful... i know
selfish as i wanna be and every time you under me
i get the vibe you might need some time to grow


when the sun fall out the sky
all i have is me in the land of do or die
a freeway, a gas pedal, and a peace of mind
now, that's the ultimate high
to the cloud i go, cloud i go
one time, baby tell me ya need me
cloud i go, cloud i go
two time, baby tell me ya love me


'cause i been drinking too much, thinking too much
we ain't been keeping in touch
and every time that i think of your touch
adrenaline pump, give me that rush
i'm going like a thief inside the wind
lord forgive me for my sins
i know she want me more, but i fiend for benjamins
she said i found the root of all evil
and lost a friend
lost in the world of a young boy from compton
that never knew love because love was never promised
i know... selfish as i wanna be
and every time i'm under you, me too
need time to grow...


when the sun fall out the sky
all i have is me in the land of do or die
a freeway, a gas pedal, and a peace of mind
now, that's the ultimate high
to the cloud i go, cloud i go
one time, baby tell me ya need me
cloud i go, cloud i go
two time, baby tell me ya love me
