stick to my roots like black thought and em
i'm black with thoughts of einstein
one word describing him: genius
what you know about the city i live in?
where the souls of the dead is livin'?
you don't know about our living conditions
we live righteously, we can give a fuck about your opinion
but it's more than just weed and women
gangsters, husslers, bullet collisions
players, pimps, who can envision?
the place where i reside where eazy was pitchin'
dre was 6'4 lifting, n.w.a had mention
quik had the turn tables mixin'
the first ones to say fuck the system

rollin' dice, gangsta rights
hood advice, homie that's compton life (yeah)


his own street like concrete
would best describe fit his gutter but see, i'm what's underneath
a young gun but not like your young chris and neef
i'm from the land of organized crime, disorderly peace
‘cause nowadays niggas hustle when they order their piece
and worship their gun the same as their religious beliefs
the compton shares can't forget the police
'cause in the hood tellin' pigs no more
it be the mark of the beast
and their main aim is just the talk of the streets
but when you see 'em please be quick on your feet
that they go, watch em!
had you for road, kill just like a possum
you could contain 'em, but there's no way that you can stop 'em
niggas plant their seeds to be gangstas
hoping one day they blossom
the same time, hope the system don't lock 'em
'cause compton raised niggas and bitches, we barely got 'em
unless you talk about the one with the attitude problem
from rosecrans to central, compton centennial
we back, that's for my people, it's official


chevy lights, women you like
husslin' nights, homie that's compton life
rollin' dice, gangsta rights
hood advice, homie that's compton life
chevy lights, women you like
husslin' nights, homie that's compton life
rollin' dice, gangsta rights
hood advice, homie that's compton life

yeah, uh, compton, right, uh
homie, homie


i don't know if he new around here
but it's good to know somebody if you're new around here
'cause it ain't too safe for you to cruise around here
niggas stick to your ass like glue around here
take new jersey and fit it shit, whatever you don't care
it ain't no magic trick if they make your shit disappear
the outcome is severe, and some of this casket will last a day
but i'm amazed 'cause the young boy been here for years
i've seen niggas shed blood blood tears
hope you not try to plan for the future niggas will mute you
had your door in the morning wake you up like roosters
introduce you to rugers
clock you in like tap judah
a nightmare on my street, it's fred krueger where i live
minus the actress and the producers
even adolenscence will shoot you over that paper

oh my god man, oh my god
we 'bout to shit on these faggots man
check it
yeah, k. dot
(let me get that)


first niggas used to rapping, get my attention
now i don't even listen
it run through one ear and out the other
and i don't buy niggas records for music
i'm more interested in their album covers
i'm a talented brotha
plus i move so quick it's like my brain came with a joystick
motherfuckers better listen when i spit
i knock records out the park
homeboy i ken griffey a hitch
and i might ken griffey ya bitch
but won't buy her shit, not even a small bag of chips
just give her long pipe 'til it's scrapin' her hips
like a waitress, the way the broad ask for the tip
if you want, just ask for a clip
i'll give ya those for free, no, i won't charge a fee
just roll up on you, like cut off sleeves
nobody can cut off the number one rap artist, damn, i am the hardest
blowin' through nintendo cartridges
to maybachin it, valet parkin' it
now people arguin' who is better?
them or him, him referring to me
them referring to the industry
hands down, jay left, now give me the crown
fuck later, i'm takin' it now
fuck haters, i'm takin' 'em down
with the red beam, red beam, silencer, don't holler it muffle the sound
bark like ten rottweilers straight from the pound
straight for the dollas, 745, older impala, scrapin' the ground
i suggest you follow, or not be smarter
seein' another broke tomorrow
you can tell the way i speak begins to stutter
first it was hard for y'all to even makin' it harder
ain't about money, then please don't bother
y'all niggas funny, talkin' bout that you run shit
when i'm lookin' at ya like "who are ya?"
y'all niggas is gas
and what make that bad is y'all niggas is trash
y'all don't wanna see me spaz
out, pull the gats out and see me blast, ouch
you better off coppin' a pen and a pad
than copyin' the last rhymes i had
and spit 'em to your homeboys 'till they all say "you wrote that?"
tell 'em lies or, give 'em the facts
it don't matter 'cause in a minute, i'ma be chargin' my raps
a g for a bar, that's 3 16's, plus a 8 bar hook nigga, add up that
i charge you a verse like dre would charge you a track
your whole budget, hoes love it
but you hate it, 'cause i'm your girls favorite
nigga, face it, you can't walk in my shoes nor change the sides tryna replace it
as far as rap, i spit in the matrix
past reality, nigga actually, i wrote a rhyme where there was no gravity (haha, oh my god)
that's a whole 'nother planet
for real holmes, i do damage
blow up ya city, even ya school campus
run in ya class while your doin' ya standards
let it blast
one gun subtractin' ya life, now that's the basics of math


oh my god man let me stop spazzin' out on these niggas, b
they have to call 911, i'm done

tell the truth, bitch, nobody, and that's real
and as far as my eyes can see
i'm the only one fucking with me
myself, so put your album right back on the shelf
and let real business get dealt
you ladies man like leon phelps
i pee on any man tryna discontinue my health
i don't give a damn on how you feel or how you felt
your small mercy won't help
when shots circle around your waist like designer belts
i design your face, the tray hitch lift ya up
rock niggas like bobby boucher, you waterboy
what you want, weed, dope, or water, boy?
it's right here, and y'all catch up, i move fast like light years
now it's back to the basics
k. dot's nothing to play with
a nigga tried to test my gangsta
i pulled out a weapon and aced it
my grade point average at the top of the brackets
i'm sick like a cancer patient
assist many players like personal agent
y'all as foul, clothes to fragrance
i'm the best now
plus the kid married to rap, old cats need to renew ya vows
sit down, practice your verbs and nouns
'cause i'm on the verge to progressin' my words
i'm the best you heard today, hands down
so hand down whatever you had
like you been in a bag
put it in garbage or trash, i'm the best you had
ever since, oh yeah, intelligence

uh (get back)
let me talk to 'em
listen


i hope niggas ain't really tryin' to break my bones
'cause if you are, make sure you know a nickname you want for that tombstone
play hard as a rock, bullets can break stones
break bad boys down like jenny did sean combs
i'm hot as an oven, you just a pressin' comb
i'm not impressed homes, you should've stayed home
and prayed that rooftop blocked you from gettin' shitted on
i gives a fuck if a&r's don't pick up the phone, huh
i swear there's no one like me
but if it is, then i got a long lost twin, or they made me a clone
i don't care about friends, i was made to be on my own
i came in this world by myself, and i'm leavin' alone
hopefully with a crib that i can call my own
with a backyard the size of the fuckin' georgia dome, pop
you pop shit, then i might pop your dome
give your homies a reason to make a memory song, huh
niggas swear that they love when the beef is on
knowin' that plummet time the only time he'll roam
you better hold your breath, i give you walkin' death
and recommend the gun bein' your chaperone
i know young niggas that look up to al capone
and they look seventeen, but i swear that their mind is grown, shit
i'm so grown and the reason why i write this way
pac and big be ghostwritin' my songs, huh
you can play the boss
but if you get shot from bein' on top
then, homie, that's your loss, shit
i'm nice wit' it
i'll pop your man then leave some money on him so it can pay for his funeral costs, get it?
the niggas tryin' to get money like fort knox
either from the rap shit or back down to the cut rock
and you can play a baller but deep inside you know you just an actor
yeah, somethin' like rick fox, huh
you ain't a thug, homie, you just a fox
in the midst of werewolves somewhere in the boondocks
and i'm really from the streets
so if i ask for beef, homeboy, don't bring me no pork chop
i turn your skin to pork, homie, with one chop
with a rusty switchblade that's dirty like bum socks, ha
they say the flow is crack
so wherever i rap, best believe you can call it a dope spot, bitch, bitch, i swear


i'm gon' ride (yeah, y'all know what it is)
and he's gotta die (uh, bitch)


it's that compton shit, niggas (get back)
uh, oh k.dot (huh, uh huh)
oh, oh, oh, oh k.dot
money by any means, nigga
