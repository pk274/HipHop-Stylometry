i'm 'bout to, send him right there, he shark food
piranhas is coming i put beat on you rap dudes

nigga nasa couldn't reach my altitude

torch in hand, yes, i'm running


i told jay rock, i like red too

who ain't a part of the family tree
do 'em like paul bunyan, axe about him
we travel like an ant colony, you can't count us
sip henny 'til my throat drown
new benz, no malice
count money 'til our hands get calloused
40 caliber in the cavalier, welcome to los
angeles, you might leave with bandages
real life, no mannequin
you pull out, no panicking, you better shoot
or have something fall on your rooftop, no raindrops
i'm talking 'bout gold bullets and black suits

closed casket fatal attraction

nah, what you get outta, outta not writing your stuff down on paper, you get the more-you know the...expression, the feeling yourself. you know what you want to say; instead of reading a paper that sounds read, it sounds narrated. unless you wanna do it narrated...


what if a dream was reality and reality was a dream?
and as complicated as it seems, if things we imagined actually happened?
and real life situations was artificial
they say we only living to die
imagine if we're already dead, waiting to live, living in hell
trying to cross over to heaven we're confusing ourselves
planet earth's like oceans 11, we're plottin' for the getaway


when my childhood friends get sent away to prison on their first offense
it's fucked up but listen, we study god but don't know him
criticize people that work on sundays, two jobs just to feed their kids
well, momma's scratching lottery tickets knowing that it's just a fairy tale
cus' we ain't gonna win
every time that she's bubblin' in, it feels like the devil's holding a pen
(shit)
don't mind me i'm just thinking again
thinking out loud, thinking the opposite of proud
cus' i'm disappointed at my self sometimes
self-esteem gets lower than night strippers
hard to motivate the right rhymes, inspired by true crimes
it's not a game, it's nothing to play with
turn it off then come back the next day, it's here to stay
struggle that is
i'm so infatuated with knowing something that's waiting after this life
that means what i'm thinking is right
punch, loop the beat for a minute
moment of silence for j. dilla, he on his way home
know he see me spillin' my heart, hope for it soon
wait a minute k. dot! you said turn it back on, bring it back
if dreams was reality
if it was cool for you to be a casualty
the only way that you can escape poverty
say that i'm weird but obviously you didn't get it when i said it the first time
you're listening too far if you hear this part
i suggest you go back and press rewind
i fast forward to common thoughts of a human
deep in my thoughts like patrick ewing in the paint
look what i brought to my state that they can't bring - the industry need a fix
stick heroin needles inside politics, this is crack music
o-pi-um, inside the veins of them, i don't abuse it
capture each moment like film, photo-shooting all my enemies moving
direct them to a casket
give it to 'em only if they ask for it, if they want...
if they wanna see reality 
what if a dream was reality and reality was a dream?
and as complicated as it seems, if things we imagined actually happened?
and real life situations was artificial
they say we only living to, die
imagine if we're already dead, waiting to live, living in hell
trying to cross over to heaven we're confusing ourselves
planet earth's like oceans 11, we're plottin' for the getaway



i got my air-conditioning on right now
real cool about it
oil talking please
slick with it


wanna know what death feel like
i suggest that you stay in the house at night
the scope that i got for the long rifle fit pretty damn right
plus my connect got a pretty good price
i could take off your neck with just one slice of the blade
no, i'm not wesley snipes
one cut can have her screaming out first aid
been this way ever since first grade
forte demeanour was to get paid
birthday solution was to shoot straight
thirteen i was ready for gunplay
stand on the block taking pay
i get four shots like a freak oh he know
not to fuck with k-d-o-t
oh, i forgot
never come around here without a glock
you want beef with your boy
nigga i put heat on your boy
leave him tied up on the back seat
with your boy duct taped won't let out noise
oh yes we got them toys
oh yes we got them choppas
lapd they can't stop us
rockets shoot down helicopters
in the kitchen (in the kitchen)
betty crocker (betty crocker)
got kick (got kick)
you hate (you hate)
you wait (you wait)
one sec (one sec)
i'll be back we then gon' west
no vest, i'ma aim at your face
unless you can stop them
i'm so throwed
oh yes people there is a problem
i say


(know what i'm talking bout?
i can feel that lane
sometimes i just lay back and let them look at me
i'm so

'cause as the gold daytons spin
(wake up, wake up, wake up)
a new revelation
good morning, america (ahh)


good morning, america
a new day, we gotta hit the schedule ahead of us
the letter k, d-o-t, add a space like a microsoft keypad
you can't see me, invisible ski mask
poke the eyes out my beanie
ghetto zorro on the headlines, i leave
feces, shit on niggas, nigga
my flow come in plural
multiple of it, majority love it
i got the masses, meaning societies, public
low dickie shorts, l.a. fashion still holding grudges
ain't forgot y'all killed pac, niggas

crème de la crème, homie
pockets fat, hand boney

land of the scandalous, every corner got a candle lit
every stop sign got a hollow tip
every sunshine got a hood under it
and you know we marilyn jones runnin' that shit
my bones made out of cement, strong arm

mel gibson, you just actin'
lethal weapon, i take you niggas to target practice

who say west coast niggas don't know anything about real hip-hop?
i'm 'bout to give you a prime example


where my gangstas at? where my dimes at?
where my nickels and dimes at?
.45's mac 10's and nines at?
9 times out of 10 half of y'all will die in this combat
if its 12 of you, shells bubble like alka-seltzer
you wanna die? i can help you
put the rap beef aside and 

this is for my mothafucking compton babies
and all the wild blocks that drove us crazy
dominguez hospital born
niggas dying fast no life insurance
black ski mask green leaf body bag liquor poured
so much 40 oz poured it's like the curb's made of gold on the ave
bullets got no names on it so if a girl get hit the response of it was like our bad


that's the mind of state, rap niggas meet your fate
say hello to the hip hop's norman bates
i ain't even burn 'em yet
dave chapelle these niggas are half baked
well done when the second first come
i have an acquired taste
i will not let not one mc go to waste
i will eat all day
i will not, cannot lose, comfortable at the top
i'm sittin' down my legs  are crossed like i had (?) shoes


i tell dude, i ain't worried about these rap dudes
they're not in my league, the west coast is me
i'm, sub-zero, i put your career on freeze
i put it on hov like i had (calvin jeans)?
i'm nightmare on elm street, come right through your dreams and
delete you like an unwanted movie scene
say hello to the team, ain't ya?
you're scared ain't ya?
the world is anxious for my lp
get pop grades, i get an a-plus, you get a d
fucking failure!

i woke up in the morning, washed my body, put some clothes on it
after that, put on my heat like alonzo mourning
cause everybody got a gun, it's like they're copy cats
so me without one is like i'm dated
i'd be out of style like adidas and fat laces
starter jackets and dookie ropes or whatever the late 80's had favored
i'm one of the best of my homo sapiens
one of the best of god's creations
he shows favoritism everytime you hear the record on radio stations
i know you mad, you ain't gotta say much, i can feel you hating
serving mc's like waitress, andre agassi, multitalented
rapper slash athlete, killing these niggas, they're screaming in agony
half of these niggas ain't half of me
half of these niggas ain't talking 'bout nothing, yakity, yakity
pushing my buttons like plaid shirts, clapping them rapidly
actually, kurt, co-bain
ten years in my career, pray to god that i don't blow up my brains lord, i'm here
great depression, i don't know much, all i know is studio sessions, and how to get my bars up
they call me subway sandwich the way i give them cold cuts
cut from a different cloth, and these yves saint laurent jeans;
they cost so much
(?) usher
either way i'm caught up in materialistic
anything that's custom, best believe i'mma get it
getting tired of it and get rid of it, don't step on the compton premises without your weap-on on your hip
the home of the stray bullet that murder the innocent
no matter the crime rate i still remain content
moving at my own pace, cause if it don't make dollars
then it really don't make sense, and if you can't comprehend
i holler like a rottweiler behind a backyard fence
(holla) - x4



blewell jeans, moby dick stitching
trigger finger itching
to trouble one of you niggas
i'm daring one of you niggas to jump
i'ma snatch you out pistol whip you
then put you back in the trunk
shit, i'm back in the front
the front page of the newspaper
they say i'm seeing more paper... true
but only if you knew that
i was in your house right now taking the  paper from you
where ya safe at?
chick is swinging on the dick like a fucking bat
and catch it all like an umpire
i'ma go hard, rims bigger than the fucking car
baby girl say why the fuck you even got tires?
i don't know, just get inside
and never question my shit again ho
i fold dough like a notebook
i see money, you pass it up like magic johnson no look
who the fuck taught you niggas how to cook
that's what i'm hearing up in your song
beat said if you're cooking up the product and your wrist don't hurt when you do it then you're doing it wrong (fucking bidness)

change is coming, change is here


holla if you hear me
in the memory of 2pac sincerely
been a g, since standing four feet on the monkey bars
steal a nigga's box like it was ours
cars roll up, nah we don't fold up
we just hold up our guns like championship cigars
mama hold the porch sipping oe out of a straw
i remember it all, them early compton days
shit, i put my all in them high school hallways
montgomery never saw the dime bags
finshed my work, finished a sale right before class was over
now what's over i'm old enough to put the world on my shoulders without a massage
never came in the truck no more, we back seat
times is rough, the only time your pledge your allegiance
if you're shot in the heart bleeding
ouch


it's gutter when the sun come up
when the sun go down
nothing but tears, no onions
under the ungodly functions, 187s and robbery will come
don't go looking for it
don't look like you hard
you're better off looking foreign, i'm warnin' ya
before that warm temperature warmin' up
your blood temperature, that corner filled with coroners
the neighbors is listeners
i'm the future of the new west for you visitors
never mind them other niggas
i'm talkin' in particular
just cause you got the flu don't mean you're sick enough
i'm igloo cold with it
if california snows then i did it
the 21st of june i'll make a blizzard
the og aim they guns at the moon
bullets break through the atmosphere
fear no man but god, the god of rap is here
and i can see you scared (whew)


real gangsters either dead or in jail
and you don't look like a zombie and i don't see no cells
i sink niggas blackships, he won't sail
and his album really ain't shit, he won't sell
and i had that mind state since twelve
no skates on my feet just running the turf for life like football cleats
5 hours asleep, nigga you do the math
that's 19 hours lost, i got insomnia bad
but, i can't complain or happen to think it too much, came passion albert einstien gained
had to hold my stomach for hunger pains over looking ?
this business got too many villians
superman is back
the cape ain't red, it's black
that's a trench coat
and the note for your information if we was dead this recarnation
watch your heads

i don't need the hype
they call me- fuck it- i don't need no introduction
no ad-libing my name 100 times for nothing
you already know it's k. dot, city of compton
analogy is like biggie and bed stuy, oakland and 2pac
i'm more focused, i'm nothing like you new guys
struggling over a few lines thinking you hot
cause your homey said you you was a few times
which is too many times
they lying to you, they telling a lie
the only time i lie in the booth is when i sleep in it
record 24 hrs, you niggas better get your bars up
i bench press this rap stuff, got it locked like handcuffs
i threw away the key, my cool is on, she love my a/c
my juice is on, and i wish one of y'all try to rob me
i shoot, and have you laying between the sheets with the eyes leased (isleys)
i push the coupe like a high speed
the helicopters come and realize that nothing's behind me is behind me
your honor, i fuck over this beat with no condom
this ain't rap it's really a porno, re-wind me back
finally the finest of 'em all is back
to define the laws of crack, y'all don't obey
y'all ain't nice, y'all just ok
you're nothing more than a little john phrase
i'm mike jordan in his prime, modern day issac hayes
theme song to shaft, equivalent to the theme song to your career
study my craft, you ignorant, i do it without a pen and pad
just inspiration: something you never had
if my pockets is something you trying to grab
i pull out the rocket and peel you back like scab
you old news, you old dudes get out of my way
let the young boy come through; don't mention my age
i'm on a mission for pay, and you astronaut niggas just crowding my space
you not in my atmosphere, you can act like you here
but actually you ain't accurate fucking with the music biz
the industry like, "fuck it, let the music be his"
no theme park, i'm not trying to amuse you kids
small shark, jaws is here, jump in the water
do he really fuck with president carter?
my reply is that i can't stay away from the bosses
got the bidding war popping like an auction
5 or 10 labels like what he hitting for? 7 zeros or more?
remember having aftermath sitting on my door
money in front of me, couldn't open the door



i'm so far ahead of my time, i got people 5 years from now pressing rewind
i'm hardly a friend with y'all, i hate rappers, where is your artist at?
if it ain't a good picture you're draw, don't bring it to the architect
often you arguing 'bout who got next, claiming you're running the game
niggas are barely walking yet, hopping all over beats without studying training camp
try studying a few greats then maybe you'll be where i'm at
your songwriting ain't great, your mixtapes mediocre
you recycle the same quotes, you're not switching the flow
your flow in the same place, just don't rap; elaborate
try to expand, try to be more creative perhaps
my rap friends, i ain't saying you're wack, psyche
like an in-voice, i'm just stating the facts, right?
(?) metaphores i write, in fact, it's been a factor
you've feared your whole life, no tv show
don't compare me with them, that's like a shark versus nemo,  a gorilla to a chimp, jordan versus kukoč
a tony montana with blow on his nose to a nino

one shot kill, one shot kill hey
one shot kill, hey, one shot kill
one shot kill go!
(pump up the volume)
(pump up the volume)


i say, thinkin' of a master plan
motherfucker, i'm a mastermind
i'm an 18-year-old dollar sign
i'm a one-man tragedy, i'm columbine
i'm sharp as fuck but no porcupine
penitentiary blade to cut yo' ass up
good-lookin' hunk
lookin' for anybody thats lookin' for me
shotty look 'em right in the eye
what do i see?
a scared nigga waitin' to die
a scared nigga, i even got you a suit and tie
something suitable
sledge hammer break down your nail cuticles
nigga, i do the unusual
torture
anything is necessary in the art of war
slam his head inside the suicidal doors
do him like li'l man off players club
roll around till his knees rub
shit
i'm a ground hog
no, i'm a young hog
hoggin' up all the money from all a y'all
it's funny how all y'all wanna be my associates
come around, smile, like that shit is appropriate
i'ma put it to your skullcap and open it
leave it on the side with that ho you was rollin' with
i'm rollin' with the nine millimeter close to my nuts and dick
you know who you fuckin' with?
i'm done with regular bowel movements
i'm on some other shit
i'm a fuckin beast, you a fuckin' bitch
i'ma fuck your bitch
then send her back to you
let her suck some dick, then let her kiss on you
now, ain't that a bitch?
that ain't right, but that’s my life
if you don’t like then we gon’ fight
psyche—you gon’ be fightin' a bullet
(pump up the volume)
(pump up the volume)


where the pump at?
thinkin' of a master plan
mothafucker, i'm a mastermind
i'm a 18-year-old dollar sign
i'm a one-man tragedy, i'm columbine
shit, you already know what i'm about
keep the guns by the couch in the living room
company act up, we give it to them
send it to them like emails
let them sell his soul
put his body on retail
if we do dirt and you tell
we gon’ put you under dirt
he was a good person
he was down to earth but now he down to earth
chillin' with the worms and the insects, his brother gon’ be next
his mother gon’ be after him, kill the family tree
if they fuckin' with him and that "him" is me
and that limb is lost on your body
aiming at your feet, probably

join them when it comes to their crunch time, i never fold
i love pressure, that's why i apply so much on niggas thinking they better
i am a clutch shooter, i am a sharp shooter
and it's great enough to hear the butterfly moving
follow me moving through these ghetto streets and school i say fuck a tardy sweep
walk into school the chief right there tried to talk at me
in the midst of piru and natty blood beef
shall we hesitate to walk down palmer 
you niggas need hugs for real
somebody to hold you real tight
you niggas need hugs for real
somebody tell 'em he's the prototype

pistol whip break the face on you, shit i does it my way like sinatra

scope'll spot ya, move wrong and i got ya
through my vision like perennial
creepin' to your house, you hear footsteps slowly as i tippy-toe
the tip i owe is through your window pane, i'm insane
one shot could leave 'em senseless, marlon wayans
psychiatrist can't restrain the mind of a sick patient
spray everything, not a single bullet wasted
be patient, you gon' be meeting mad links
put 'em in the basement
bet, i'm strapped with tnt
follow rules every morning, this bitch coming with me, ooh
that's what they say when they see me in your coupe
sunroof, rims spinning like a fucking hoola-hoop
you tried to play big and say "gimmie the loot"
tables turned, now the people saying "please don't shoot"
get out the way, lady, and try to make it to safety
