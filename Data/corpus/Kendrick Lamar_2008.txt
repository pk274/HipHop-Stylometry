compton, stand the fuck up

drop 40 for the glock 40, that's a hood disc cop
that's an accessory gun, sesame seed buns for the beef y'all brung, y'all done fucked up
fuck with the wrong fuckup, i been a nut since, pops fucked moms
fucked up in the head, i'm living but i'm braindead
life goes on, and you don't need a psychic in order to read my palm
niggas will get you first where i'm from


that's why i creep on em
i creep on em
i creep on em

niggas play cold, put the heat on em

i said you don't need a psychic in order to read my palm
you know what's in it, nigga, don't play stupid, you seen lifе's ending, nigga
you seen la movies beforе
pull up, pump out that red honda door
what's up? fuck nigga, i'm much quicker, on my toes like steroids through marrion jones's bones
for the camera, hammers, human home depot, not your car, rather, get your soul repo'd
backflip, tummy tuck, body fold, when i hit em up
shotty clog up arteries, part of me, but
you've gotta feel lost on me, bullets, burn, oh so awfully
and it's your turn, to feel the fabric of a body bag
357 kick back, that's karate class
get back, black ski mask, black gloves
let the burner spill on you, no "my bad"s, when

no shower (creep on em)
one hour (creep on em)
you'll be dead (you'll be dead)


hit the chest, hit the neck, hit the head
taking off half his head, taking off, speeding off, sidewalks
code red, 187 said "hello", "goodbye"
uh oh, i tried, to tell em hard heads take soft naps, dead on arrival
that mean he had ambulance music to ride to
i ride to, 'me against the world', makaveli
got a chicken head, she my baby girl named desi
eagle, regal, pull up, pop out, circle round the block just to make the sequel
but this ain't a west crave flick
where i'm from, scary movies don't exist
compton, kill shit, die fast
hit the steering wheel, make the car crash
hit the light pole, black out the whole damn ave
i black out 3 k's, make the trunk drag
dump fast like a quick shit, no shit


i creep on em (creep on em)
i creep on em (creep on em)

sorry father, i gotta bother some of your children
some of your children gossip, too much, that's a problem
chew up any beef, aim it at any collars, homie we play for keeps
rifles coming with silencers, green army fatigue
war general, nigga, see the patch on my sleeve
see the stripe on my heart, been a pro from the start
i could hit my target eyes closed in the dark
you don't want no argument, park
your bad mouth 'fore i steal the car
cussing me out might get your life took, boy
look boy, better be bruce leroy, we seek & destroy with the vengeance, depending
on your sincerity, my, moment of clarity may be terminated
but your plea better be good or your moms might be devastated
put 3 inside his hood, he was transmission slipping when i

my words come with emotions, you can hear me smile

bless the child, i been blessed, so i rap from the gut till i'm throwing up my biceps
this is me, world, accept me world, i am kendrick
don't accept mе world, then fuck you world, relentlеss
me, no sleep, mama never get to see me
i pass by the studio because her future need me
my family future need me
two brothers, one sister, all come beneath me
first born, and guess what?
they all wanna see me blow up, like the world trade
centre my career, study, so i won't hyrdroplane
ready for any zodiac signs, plenty more
faces where that come from, i might smile, i might cry, why?

my grandma said "kendrick, that boy gon be famous"
spinning a ball round my finger just for her entertainment
she was in love with me, i was in love with her
she was a gemini too, and still, i love her
sometimes i holla for, your name when i'm insecure
i know you hear me, girl
your love was so pure
reminds me of my mommas, you know i'm still sore
from your early departute, wanted you to live more
but with your second phase, i kill more
rappers than i did before, similies, metaphors
you know what? fuck this industry
i ain't ready for it, it's not me
it's watered down consumers, not buying what's hot now
and i'm trying, my best, but i guess not because i don't sound
like soulja boy but i refuse to play 
that's k-dot the gemini
just call me k-dot the gemini
you don't know, if i smile or i might cry
flip on you like a dirty project mattress

split fucking personalities need balance

been a coroner like david banner i'm the owner
of the marijuana aroma you're smelling hear the donor yelling "it's me bitches"
who did it, i did it, take 'em where they can't go
like planet venus leaning like a mad scientist
laboratory bottles of empty heineken telling stories about the ones that came before me
china-man squinting his eyes because i'm blinding him, my shine is
bigger than a strike of lightning they liking him because i like to win
never lose, put me on a pedestal
bet i pedal victories until i pedal off my shoes
welcome to the lions room, challenge anybody whom
wanna try they luck they get fucked up and all you heard was (oohh)
say hello to the little big homie, and your reality ain't realer than this homie

i'm just a product of what was happening in the nineties
plus my uncle used to fuck with your auntie
tell me 80 percent ho run in your family
shame on you, shame on your mother, sister, cousin too
you all produced the same tendencies
while i continue to stack plentl cheese
on my expedition to witness my own odyssey
out of three, of your favorite bet i give them more flavor like seasoning salt
call me the darth vader invading a raw plot like a space crew, stayed at home
all the gangbangers with the police radars like the marcus rustle but i hustle
never change up see my muscle, training like i'm constipated bringing in any drama
if you insist, i'm six for six
get your ass rolled and twisted, like a blunt rap so fall back
like winter ended
