starving every day, see my face where the bowl is
bowl on my face, i walk while my mouth hold it

i'm the best rapper under 25, 24 inches on my ride
ball like 23 and i shot my first .22 when i was 9

21 gun salute
and my soldiers killed 20 of your troops at a time
and i got about nine teens on the corner fucking with marijuana
jive and heard about 18 rappers say that a bird can go for 17.5
motherfuck that my sweet 16's be equivalent to about 15 pie
i was 14 when i wrote a rhyme
all i seen was 13 ghosts every time i wrote a crazy line
all these 12 bars in my verses, that's what notorious and pac arrived
god dammit i spit just like a mac 11 every time
i drop jewels, you drop dimes, you pretending to be like mine
i intend to put about 10 of you rappers on channel 9
straight up, fuck around and get ate up
cut 'em up in 7 ways, funeral carried by 6 in 5 days you'll know i go for
money when i sink my teeth in carter iii beats

i'm the one
the beat was the pussy
and i cum, hard

man, beyoncé, i'm mad at you
man...


they say, "hello" (ayy), "hello" (ayy)
i can daydream about beyoncé all day
thinkin' 'bout the good times 'fore she met jay
see ya know
they say, "hello" (ayy), "hello" (ayy)
i really thought i had a chance to be your man
until i seen the video with the ring on your hand
it hurt me so


i remember you were sixteen on the tv screen with wyclef
were you my type? oh god, yes, i was impressed
you was like "no, no, no," i was like 12 years old
hoping that one day i could chaperone while you were on the road
you wore braids with a bangin' body
look like you did pilates, a lot of sit-ups probably
but bump that, i was there from the start
even when latoya luckett and that other doo-doo bucket broke your heart
hope you didn't cry cause honestly they were just so-so
they couldn't sing anyway, you deserve to go solo
no disrespect to kelly and michelle, i'm just sayin' they cool
but you? you are somethin' like wonder woman
and i just wanna hold your hand, bring you to compton
gonzales park, we can build castles in the sand
eatin' hot cheetos with pickle juice in it
put that napkin down, you know i'll lick your fingers when you're finished


they say, "hello" (ayy), "hello" (ayy)
i can daydream about beyoncé all day
thinkin' 'bout the good times 'fore she met jay
see ya know
they say, "hello" (ayy), "hello" (ayy)
i really thought i had a chance to be your man
until i seen the video with the ring on your hand
it hurt me so


i just bought the sasha fierce cd
gazed at the cover for a whole 5 minutes, 'til my girlfriend hit me
she jealous of you, 'cause i don't love her like i love you
i even make her do the "uh-oh, uh-oh," just like you do
she tell me i'm obsessed, i tell her we connect
like ice cube way before the mac 10 feud
she's like, "you goddamn fool, that girl's rich and you're broke"
i said, "so? i'm only 500 mil' away, there's still hope"
anyway, i had feelings even way before you got paid
and i didn't laugh when you bust your ass on the stage
and i salute kanye for takin' up for you
i would've stole the award just to prove that i love you
but jay should've did that i thought he had your biz-ack
what happened, mr. izzo? hopico? fredrico?
he used to be my favorite 'til he abandoned my diva
now i tell everybody, nas had killed him on "ether"


they say, "hello" (ayy), "hello" (ayy)
i can daydream about beyoncé all day
thinkin' 'bout the good times 'fore she met jay
see ya know
they say, "hello" (ayy), "hello" (ayy)
hopefully, i still have a chance
maybe if i sabotage your man
you never know, hm


i'ma sneak backstage at a mary j blige concert
with an "i love mary" shirt, then find jay-z
and push him into a dancer, hopefully, they lock lips
that's when i yell out, "sounwave, hurry up take the pic!"
put it on bossip the same night, yeah, that sound quite right
publicity like that? yep, they'd be sure to fight
better yet, i'ma steal her cell, then call up affion
he impersonates jay well, get beyoncé on the line
then make up some bogus shit, like, "you don't rub the back of my knees right
so this marriage is over with
and the ring that's on my finger? guess what? i'm throwin' it!
cling, you heard the sound, so you know i did"
haha that should get 'em
that should break em up like a kit kat when i do that, yeah, true that
i'ma put the plan in motion, that's for sure
but if i end up with macy gray, this plan never work


yee, man, i hope jay don’t be mad at me 'bout this song

that's a quote from ab-soul
i suppose since you laugh that's the ultimate goal
on behalf of the top dawg conglomerate, shall stay anonymous
searching seven continents accomplishing big shit
big ass, big tits she on me
and just to get to me she'll fuck the homies... homie's homies
the life of a cool nigga, my nigga tony said
"just do you, nigga!" show and prove, nigga
and they gon' play you for a fool that's for sure
'til they know you got the stinkiest stool, nigga!"
i ain't tripping i'm just tipping on fo-fo's
back in the city and tipping on four hoes
that boy got a cold cold, he's sick con, slick on
dropin red jewels like a school bar mitzvah, ooh
straight like that


people don't be shy
release them balloons to the sky
i need the world to celebrate me! (one time)
you'll never know when i'm gone (two times)


why y'all complain about og's?
i don't look at a legend and say you owe me
not snoop, not dre, not ice cube
i don't care me and quik went to the same school
i look in the mirror and do it myself
like a self made nigga, i don't need a maid, nigga
do i need a co-sign from dre or jigga?
they can make me much bigger
but do i need 'em though?, i just need a flow

and weed move slow right now but e go
you know what i'm talking 'bout? i look at your audemars
to put ya'll in time out, it's time to unveil the real
and your career is about as frail as ms. winehouse
just salute, grab a flute, and pull the wine out, ooh
just like that


people don't be shy
release them balloons to the sky
i need the world to celebrate me! (one time)
you'll never know when i'm gone (two times)

shame on him! (what?)
lemme put my gloves on
and my scrubs on
i'm the chemist that's whippin' it in the kitchen
this here is not for the children
you need parental advision
if you wanna learn how to cook in the dope business
first you bargain shop
look for the priciest chickens
i recommend that you pay jorge a visit
got it wrapped in saran
17.5 no, drop four grand, this is la man!
unless it be a drought
but homie if it ain't, then it is somewhere else
flip your hustle down south
that's a whole other story though
back to the lesson, hope you're takin' down your footnotes, class is in session
get your instruments
grab some baking soda, a triple beam, a beaker
and a hanger you can stir it with
split nine os four ways in that 36
place it on the triple beam
as hard as it may seem, it's not that tricky
say you'll get it baby, just bear with me
confidence before compliments
now let's get busy
this is the procedure
250 grams of coke, 150 grams of soda
place it in the beaker
your water should be boiling by then
grab a small cup and pour it in
twist the hanger until it's paper thin
place the hanger in the beaker then give your wrist a circular spin
but hold on it gets tricky again!
as your hand rotate
you're probably thinkin' it's safe
until it starts to harden, slowing down the pace
the muscle inside your arm is makin' your joints ache
you're strugglin' on the job, but don't lose faith
wait...you got it back soft (good)
now pour some hot water inside the beaker jar
the work should rise to the top
then pour some cold water on that
that's when the dope should drop
snatch the cookie out the jar, grab a razor from the cabinet
place it on the cardboard, then chop
as soon as the razor hit the work, you're happy
you're excited that the chemistry worked
this the fiend's appetite
this bigger than life
you turned to mr. nino brown in one night
you should thank me twice
though you learned from a chemist who never moved a brick in his life
how ironic...hmm
like most of you rappers



yeah, kendrick lamar
this for the town, nigga


me, i'm from the hub city, yeah, that compton court building
caught a murder when his homie died, judge caught feelings
i'm on rosecrans, chilling right inside best outlest
five dollar little caesar, momma shopped at food-4-less
elementary mcnair, say what's up to vanguard
centennial high, had me swimming with a pool of sharks
me, i'm just a good kid, tryna keep it neutral
but i'm well aware that a square can get shot too
most crip and some piru, that's just how the game go
hood on every corner, stop for gas and get your brains blown
bitches with fat asses, burners in the stashes
murders in july, call that summer time madness
rest in peace 4 bent, rest in peace mausberg
swear to god, when i make it big, your voice'll be heard
me, i'm just a good kid, tryna keep it positive
though i know it's chaos, forever my heart will live in



go getter with no cheddar
just a white tee and a swap meet sweater
my life is likely to see great endeavors
but i can't win if i can't get it together
what i gotta do in order to see success?
havin' the world's best to call me the best?
pull up at the grammy awards as the best dressed
with an address linked to a beautiful actress?
a dollar and a dream, i feel j. cole
word to the hole in my pocket and the hoes
that don't wanna fuck with a broke nigga with ambition
but the last time i checked, y'all was broke bitches
make a name for myself then bubble like the ass of buffy
when she wearin' a tight belt
the homies on the block can say whatever they say
i don't wanna be a killer, i wanna be a gates


what i gotta do in order to see success?
havin' the world's best to call me the best
pull up at the grammy awards as best dressed
with an address next to a beautiful actress
do i gotta run in your spot and start blastin'
better yet, rob the nearest nix check cashing
ear hustle on a nigga that's constantly braggin'
catch him at the light, snatch him out his jeep wagon
or maybe i gotta hook up with jose
cop 5 bricks of the yay, head to the bay
area or carry the birds to va
let the clipse distribute the work all day
then come back home
every three weeks flip three to six zones
homies on the block can say whatever they want
i don't wanna be a dealer, i wanna be a trump
donald, that is


in time, it'll come
just stay focused and humble, my son
show and prove, prove you're the one
it's not about who is dopest
who wants it the most
so just go out and get it
(and when i do i do it again
then i go back
when i do i do it again
then i go back
thug it out)
go out and get it
(but for now i'ma go head and doug it out
i gotta rhyme, rhyme)
go out and get it
go out and get it


so welcome to the story of my life
see i'm tryna get to get right off the shit that i write
make a fortune, buy some porsches for my momma and my wife
pops engine in this old school run tight
but as you listenin' to k-d-o-t
man, me and my girl split the bucket of kfc
she listenin' to drake and all i can say is "damn
these niggas that much better than me, baby?"
i don't think this is meant to be
cause i'm always losin' self esteem
she paused the iphone then said, "huh?"
i repeated what i said then she replied, "shut up"
you know you the best boy, you gotta keep doin' it
but don't forget when you do, just keep you in it
and never listen to what the industry say
don't be a typical artist, be more like jay
russell, barry gordy, quincy jones, bob johnson, sean combs, l.a. reid
young black entrepreneurs did what it took to succeed, yeah
so i gotta see success, i gotta make it off them rosecrans steps
risin' to the top like a soda shook up
bout to pop, and i'll pop on whoever's in my way



his eyes bloodshot red
i watched him as he took a fifth of henny to the head in memory of his brother
reminiscin' on them playing sega with each other
he was hurtin', i could see it, plenty tears, no kleenex
i stood by his side because that was my homie
gave him a hug, some of his brother's blood got on me
clinchin' his fist on some angry shit
stood up, sat back down on the curb and asked me who they be hangin' with
i wasn't sure, so i gave him no answer
but i was sure that he had him a blammer and wanted war
revenge, what do you say to a good friend
that just lost it and grabbin' choppers out the closet?
i tried my best to make him re-neg
but he was like, "my nig, this feelin' is more than personal"
i stood down
he hopped in a four-door honda accord
before he bent the block, he said, "k-dot...
"...you wouldn't understand"


(these streets can turn a kid to killer in minutes
not by choice, but forced to be a menace
can someone just pray for me, oh woe)
or, at least, try to understand
(the city pressure
the ak-47, twin mac-11s
the desert eagle shotty and the smith & wessons
pray for me, oh woe)


corners become monuments for the dead
candles on the pavement, postcard read
rest in peace, the yellow tape blockin' off the streets
a baby mama yellin' at the police
but you don't understand
you figure that we're just a bunch of niggas but the picture here's a story untold
see, this wasn't in our plans
babies from the late '80s wasn't born crazy, we was raised that way
put that malcom x book down, then raise that k
complete chaos when we off x pills and st. ides
look the devil in the face, from a sane eye
cast the spell on you like makeelah and the bee
every killer in the street is a teen with a corrupted mind
substance, time, is no longer an issue
we don't have it, so pass the tissue
then close the casket, kiss the momma when you can
and tell her you understand, but you don't understand


(these streets can turn a kid to killer in minutes
not by choice, but forced to be a menace
can someone just pray for me, oh woe)
and, hopefully, you'll understand
(the city pressure
the ak-47, twin mac-11s
the desert eagle shotty and the smith & wessons
pray for me, oh woe)


he came back fifteen minutes later
he said, "dot, i went on one, do me this favor
dump these guns in a safe place, let nobody see you
this as critical as it gets, my nigga, i need you"
i said, "alright, so what happened?"
"seen a few niggas slippin' and i just started clappin'
i didn't care who i was hittin'"
that's wild shit, but anyway, i got you
i love you my nigga make sure you hit me up by tomorrow
i woke up the next mornin' with a cold
allergies got me sneezin' and wipin' my nose when it was leaking
checked the medicine cabinet, lookin' for some dayquil
but all i seen was some aspirin, s'just my luck
i got up, went to rite-aid
hopin' that the pharmacy department had the right aid
i bought it and left
walked to the parking lot, that's when i seen the faces of death
said they was lookin' for my man, with a chopper in they hand
prayin' that it would jam, but you don't understand


(these streets can turn a kid to killer in minutes
not by choice, but forced to be a menace
can someone just pray for me, oh woe)
i'm tellin' you, do you understand?
(the city pressure
the ak-47, twin mac-11s)
huh? do you understand?
(the desert eagle shotty and the smith & wessons
pray for me, oh woe)


it's like
it's a revolving door
that i've been a part of
my whole life
fucked up, right?

i take a sip of hennessy and then get pissy drunk
i ain't a drinker, i'm a thinker, call it what you want
but if you turn your back, know that you just missed your chance
to witness the realest shit that's ever been told to man
i found myself losing focus at a sunday service
embarrassed so i start questioning god, "what is my purpose?"
he said to live the way he did, that's all he want from me
spread the word and witness, he rose on the first sunday
i said alright, enthused that my lord gave a listen
i opened my bible in search to be a better christian
and this from a person that never believed in religion
but shit, my life is so fucked up, man; i can't help but give in
i'm giving testimonies to strangers i never met
hopped on the pulpit and told them how i was truly blessed
felt like i'm free from all my sins when the service was over
walked out the church, then got a call that my homie was murdered
then lost my faith again


single black parent from compton raising children of four
that's four innocent bastards 'cause, papa, they don't know
her day consists of working back and forth with babysitters
can't find no one to watch her kids, so she pay her sister
her baby daddy ain't 'bout shit, that nigga ain't 'bout shit
spilt his daughter milk just to cop a new outfit
she pray to god every night, hoping that he'll mature
and maybe one day his kids something that he'll live for
baby wanna go back to school, but she need some help
because it's hard trying to pay the bills when you're by yourself
she thought about credit card scams, 'til she heard a voice
that said, "the devil is a lie, make a better choice"
and so it's back to mcdonald's and every month dealing
with those crazy ass people at the county building
looked to the heavens and asked him to make a better way
then got a letter in the mail, lost her section 8
then lost her faith again


this for my people that stressing whenever times is hard
your mind's slipping, wondering, "is there really a god?"
knowing you shouldn't think that way and trying to freeze your brain
but whenever there's pain, that feeling forever remains
we can't believe what we can't see and reality seems stronger than prayer
cause you tried to change your life, and now you live in a wheelchair
and your son was born with cancer and he live in urgent care
at the tender age of 12, and you feel that no one cares
searching for answers, that's human nature, you ain't in the wrong
just know when you feeling that way his spirit's in the room
i watched people i know pray and catch the holy ghost
and wonder why i ain't ever caught that feeling before
maybe they know him better, or i don't know no better
but what i do know, is that he's real and he lives forever
so the next time you feel like your world's about to end
i hope you studied because he's testing your faith again


i'd rather not live like there isn't a god
than die and find out there really is
think about it

yeah
mhm

hehe, can i pay my past a visit?
centennial compton school district
and video campus shut the fuck up your premises
king drew and westchester had the baddest bitches
and my nigga l wood had a white toyota, and we got pulled over
had to hide the bottle because there was mix with hennessy and soda
every time we rode up we was unsober
and everybody had know that
my nigga yan yan had all the red p hat
which was really dumb because where we was at
was the other side and more than likely
the other side really didn't like that
didn't have no burner so if they would shot us we never really could shoot back
could've lost our life over hood rats
we was dumb as fuck but lucky for us we was lucky enough
that the black car didn't pull up and ask, where y'all niggas from"
i know some, nigga less fortunate was fucking with the enemies' bitch
she had a fat ass and a brown camaro, but it wasn't that fast it was like a v6
but anyway she was one of those hoes in high school with the cornrows
size 5 jordans, rolex sporting, and wanna fight everybody she knows
well she's important, well she wasn't, she was just so and so so and so cousin
he was a red, so anytime she got into it, that's who she would get
now let me get back to the plan
homie had ask, " do ya got a man?"
she said,"no", he said, "oh yeah
where do you stay?" she said, " rosecrans"
rosecrans and what? she said, "don't matter just know i fuck
he said, "what? you're a, you're a little freaky bitch huh?"
she said, "yeah, daddy, i can you get you sprung
i can work that pussy and the tongue
if you come over, i can make you cum
if you come over make sure that you bring drink
because i like to get to drunk."
and that he did, that friday he was where she lived
notice that he was out of bounds
but didn't give a fuck cause he wanted to fuck that bitch right now
walked in the house, rubber on, panties down
oldies playing in the background
let's get it on marvin gaye had bumped to the morning
time to go, picked his pants up off the floor
kissed that bitch in the mouth then walked to the door
when he walked out he seen a four four bluh!
didn't know that was the pussy he was dealing with


and that's how you get your ass killed bitch!
that's how you get your ass killed bitch!
that's how you get your ass killed bitch!
get your ass killed bitch! how?
fucking with them hoes, them hoes, them hoes, them hoes
them hoes hoes, them scandalous hoes
them hoes hoes will have you uh dead dead dead


look. i guess we all can learn from mistakes
but your first mistake, might be your death date
and death doesn't wait, on no one
a million ways to die, and you can make it a million and one
if you not aware of the rules or maybe tryna fill someone else shoes
like a square trying to be a gangster kind of remind of this one dude
he wasn't thirteen he was twenty two
when he went to first get put on the hood
he wasn't born it, boys in the hood the movie made him think it was all good
but usually this type of person want to prove his s s s s self on purpose
tell everybody quit working, but really he's worthless
his momma had money, his daddy had money, so he had money
the og's that gave him a pistol, think that he was gonna be just another crash dummy
and the funny thing about it he thought he was bout it like p-miller
but he wasn't no killa
just a monkey hanging around a bunch of gorillas
everybody wanna be tough guy so he did, approached this guy like, "where are you from?" with his gun but didn't shoot it, rule number one
never pull out if you don't use it
even though the dude didn't banged the very next day he seen around the way blew his brains out while homeboy was cruising
not knowing the scariest nigga will split your shit


and that's how he got his ass killed bitch!
that's how he got his ass killed bitch!
that's how he got his ass killed bitch!
fuck around and get your ass killed bitch! how?
not knowing the g codes, the codes the codes
the g codes, the codes the codes
the g codes, if you don't know then your already dead dead dead
feel me?

the homies say i'm the truest
the bitches think i'm the cutest
the definition what cool is
boy, i thought you knew this
bitch, i do this!


uh, i used to wanna be like michael jordan
figured that i hit the nba and make a fortune
thank god for these rap recordings
i can ball like him on every verse and chorus
501s, louis letterman jacket
little brother only 5, momma put him on my taxes
you know that compton ghetto shit
that every section 8 tenant is familiar with
ooh wee, they say he something like the 70s
but i'm from '87, with a thousand dimes
you got 80 sevens
gourmet sneakers, hair nappy
fucking all my high school teachers
that was '05 bro
and i don't like 'em if the ass thin
and i don't wife 'em if a nigga is her best friend
the fuck i look like?
a million bucks, and that's why


the homies say i'm the truest
the bitches think i'm the cutest
the definition what cool is
boy, i thought you knew this

the definition what cool is

she looking at the car like she wanna fuck it
she looking at the wrist like she wanna fuck it
hating on her girlfriend just so i can fuck it

uh, so give me fifty feet champ
run until i got a bunion and my feet cramp
i'm in the hot spot, i know they seats damp
and i don't need your cosign, that's a cheap stamp
you-you niggas check this cash and i'm gt crashing
105 off-ramp, hey
and little nigga got it going on, g5

september 22nd, 2009
kendrick lamar
to... to...


let me start off this letter saying i don't like you
scared of you but i will fight you
i stare at the ceiling and think about you
curiosity killing me, thinking of when i'ma meet you
you introduced yourself to so many others, mothers, sisters and brothers, children and babies drive me crazy i wonder
why you love people that love people that do right?
is it rocket science to you or is it just your type?
one of my biggest fears, is waking up 4 in the morning and gotta hear you met one of my peers
or maybe a family member that you thought was cool
or maybe a person that i'll never meet 'cause of you
you, son of a bitch and i wish you never existed
and i swear i'd blow your brains out if you pay me a visit
but that's not realistic, 'cause you'll never rot
but i'ma still send this letter off
p.o. box, and when you get it....


please take it personal
please take it personal
please take it personal
because it's personal


let me continue this letter saying i don't like you
scared of you but i will fight you
should be ashamed of the moves you make
the pain you bring, the sorrow and the hearts you break
everyday you remind me that you're always there
'cause every time i come around someone's getting shot down
and all i say is a prayer, "so help me, lord!"
then the lord talk back, "i can't help you, boy!"
that's fucked up, my life's fucked, was cursed before birth
and what's fucked up, i gotta live my life with the hurt
of knowing that you're everlasting
dwelling upon the masses
of the earth fatal assassins
snatchin' bodies
probably, on my notepad as i write
why the fuck you wanna take my life?
sooner or later, i'm tired and weary and my gray hairs are not in my favor
so when i write on this paper
it's real talk
so...


please take it personal
please take it personal
please take it personal
because it's personal


let me start off this letter saying i don't like you too
and the reason we haven't met because i've been busy doing whatever since grade school
i've watched your every move
you slipped up a few times, i gave you a pass
so don't say i ain't sympathetic
but you can barely get curiosity, i'ma dead it
everybody wanna know why i act this way
let's just say... i had a bad day
matter fact, everyday
but i take it out on somebody and you could probably find me wherever the wolves parade
i was born to be a killjoy, i'm an old brat
conceived by adam and eve, so who you mad at?
not me, see me? i'm just doing my job
and you ducking me? is mos def an odd
so why send this letter as if i never knew you?
i rather knock on your door and just hand it to you


please take it personal
please take it personal
please take it personal
because it's personal

sit still, and close your eyes (smoke to it)
what's behind the other door, oh
no more silence (no more silence)
don't kill this thing we got called love (don't shoot)
just searching for the perfect shot


i used to write rhymes, all day and all night
while you were playing playstation, my pencil was erasing lines
my conscious only knew whats half tight
at 3:14, it's time to give me a slice, my nigga
this is a dog's fight, my nigga
the soundtrack to life, my nigga
kendrick lamar, his momma called him that
he watched house party, and ate apple jacks
sold sega games, his cousin sold crack
he pumped reeboks, his uncles pumped packs
pump, fake, jumpshot, ball hit the back
board dreams of being pointguard was off limits jack
that's because that's these compton streets was built not to win
you killed the nigga, i stole a bible, is that a sin?
pardon me though, i'm searching for answers
the good kid from the ugly city, that's mad that he's handsome
where is the love?


when love comes calling, don't love back
when love comes calling, don't look away
when love comes calling (where is the love?), don't look back
when love comes calling, don't look away


give me rings, give me chains, mane
give me a blue benz, red porsche, red range
give me black bitches, white hoes, new clothes
a mansion with marble floors and security codes
then give me some land, or maybe i'll land a, g5
clearport, say hello to the man
give me awards, grammies, and let the crowd applaud
my name 'til they strain the veins in they vocal cords
give me fame and fortune, me and trump on golf courses
with that being said, give me tiger sports endorsements
give me billboards, whatever that people will kill for
manahattan and 40/40, no 40's but rose poured
give me vanity, give me kurt cobain sanity
give me a city where channel 7 newscasters cameras be
give me horror like amity, no, give me the charts
and if you ever renege, i'll still give you kendrick lamar, this is me
and that's love


now everybody smoke to it, for this is, the celebration

everybody, just clap your hands if you're real
middle finger up, give a fuck how they feel
be yourself, just show me you're real
middle fingers up


just let me be me (hey)
that's the only way i know (only way i know)
just let me be me (hey, hey)
that's the only way i know
that's the only way i know how to hold it down
that's, that's the only way i know how to hold it down


uh, i just wanna be me
no disrespect, but motherfuck you
my education stopped at a high school degree
but i can outsmart any high iq
draped in some fly shit, call me jeff goldblum
cold, my style making my nose run
oh, i stare at the mirror then realize, that real lies within me
some say i'm crazy cause i think like i need a shrink
ask too many questions about the stars and earth shit
rather be in the studio than out buying drinks
so if i'm not clubbing, don't think i'm on some jerk shit
and california on that jerk shit
but i'd just rather 2-step, like my first steps
jill scott on my ipod, as my head rests
yes


just let me be me (hey, hey)
that's the only way i know (only way i know)
just let me be me (hey, hey)
that's the only way i know
that's the only way i know how to hold it down
that's, that's the only way i know how to hold it down


and yeah i know i'm from compton, cali
but i don't lace up chucks or rock tan khakis
and skinny jeans ain't quite the lick
i probably would wear 'em but my dick don't fit
ha ha ha, i like to joke, got a sense of humor?
still face, play me short like an oompa loompa
you ain't gotta screw up your face in front of the kids
won't you lighten up like michael did?
i grew up with killers man, people who killed men
but my character never could be like them, man
and they respect that, say that i'm real man
not a fake person, that's the sims man
live my life through some film, man
i ain't acting out shit, i be packing out shows
cause they know that they don't know kendrick fo' sho
and oh


just let me be me (hey, hey)
that's the only way i know (only way i know)
just let me be me (hey, hey)
that's the only way i know
that's the only way i know how to hold it down
that's, that's the only way i know how to hold it down


almost lost my life to the industry
had to look through a photobook to remember me
these label heads ain't nothing but bullshit
have you with professional killas, chasing hits
lying to yourself, all over an image
making records they want, that was wrecking my brilliance
my mama said, "boy, that don't sound like you."
i said, "this is the sound, though."
my only excuse
quite frankly, dusted off my shoes with my hankie
and kicked it like he skate, make these motherfuckers hate me
the reason why they hate, cause these motherfuckers ain't me
and you can underrate me, but i know what i'm worth
a diamond in god's dirt, a diamond in winter
watch the simpsons and eating some cereal for dinner
see i give you my life, to mix it up in a blender
to make sure that you feel me


just let me be me (hey, hey)
that's the only way i know (only way i know)
just let me be me (hey, hey)
that's the only way i know
that's the only way i know how to hold it down
that's, that's the only way i know how to hold it down


i think that i finally reached the pinnacle
of finding myself as an individual
the world is so typical
i just wanna be higher than that
i used to wanna be the messiah of rap
infatuated with becoming a relevant star
trying to say goodbye to the glamorous chains and cars
that i never had, but wrote it in my raps to make you mad
vanity, they say that it can damage me
so do i really want it?
if i didn't, i guess i'm a cool cocaine connect
that means i'll be frontin'
cooking in a laboratory, hoping i can tell a story
that the whole world can feel, like the ones that came before me
knowing that i'm misunderstood
so i gotta get my point across like a snitch would
and i would never walk in the shadow that never was really there
or try to fill the shoes of an invisible pair
and dave said he proud of my newfound honesty
and all i could say is, "will the radio care?"
yeah, or should i say no?
or should i just stop and come with a whole new approach?
you heard my hip-hop when i was 16 years old
well that was me then, now i'm an adult
22, like the smallest of guns that you know
most determined, but with the smallest of funds to show
but i'm not worried
my talent should take me places i've never been
the world should turn as soon as my records spin
i wanna be the highest, on top of all the bullshit
the negative you bring, the stress, the violence
the capital punishment, the loud police sirens
too focused, one word, righteous
and this is kendrick lamar, and soon ya'll know cloud 9, ya'll
that means i wanna be the highest
too focused, one word, righteous
that means i wanna be the highest
too focused, one word



wow
i think i must have forgot or something
like i ain't hot or something
like i don't make your girl take off her top or something


i'm like

she sucked my dick and got frostbite
i'm that cool

they don't say k.dot is here
they say his spaceship has landed

like a kitchen floor
but my floor is marble
i ride in the carpool because i got two whores
in the back of that chrome

baby you understand me now
if sometimes you see that i'm mad
don't you know no one alive can always be an angel
when everything goes wrong, you see some bad
but i'm just a soul whose intentions are good
oh lord please don't let me be misunderstood


as soon as the beat drop
within two bars, you already said i'm hot
they savor, my fruits of labor
my flow is sweeter than strawberries, oranges, and apricots
god-dammit i raised the standards of the status-quo
to go against me you gotta be more than professional
you got to go extra hard like an erection with no protection
and i be fucking all these bars
we be sexing i'm a nympho
for the instrumentals, all right, i admit it
matter of fact i got a hot date tonight, real rap
take this and take that from the machine
got this money up, with no caffeine
prepare me is kerosene struck by a bolt of lightening
you looking at me then you're sight seeing
and what that means is that this human being is fly, don't try to duplicate
i'm authentic, i see you scoping my style like forensics, that is foul
tech! leave 'em by the benches


i'm just a soul whose intentions are good
oh lord please don't let me be misunderstood


i see the future better than your computers
apple software got the next 10 years scared i'm fred krueger
rugers on my hip, terminate all intruders
leave them dead inside the sewers
shoulda' coulda' knew i was a murderer
burning up the very sun, the rapture
the god is back, they said he'd come, but i came faster
i'm not an actor, if you play denzel, you'll be thrown through a windshield
the 9 milli' is handheld, the ak is hands-on
now the battlefield i can land on one thousand mines and don't blow up because i'm the bomb
inside your cd deck, duck for cover, guard your neck, i demand respect
if i never see a check, at least i got these rap niggas in check
preach tabernacle fetch the holy bible if i'm lying
king of my jungle, swear to remain humble, keep my vision tunnel
because i don't need to get sidetracked, my producer name is sounwave and he gives me beats by the batch


i'm just a soul whose intentions are good
oh lord please don't let me be misunderstood


...snatch your bitch if she got a great appetite
for the top dog catalog, that means everybody
several bodies on the shoty don't make it eight rappers
damn i hate rappers, don't call me that
if you called it how you seen it you would call me real rap
i don't fabricate shit, all i do is keep it real
eat, sleep, and take shits wipe me down if you will
hold up, big truck, lurkin' with the monster grill
four fifteens i got beat like emmett till
put me in my g-mode schooling every hot-head
tell them about the g-code, like eskimos
my arms froze, popsicle
observing the game, i'm so official

bubble kush in the trunk, choppers in the front seat

i move low-key, i think like a double og
inside of an old school bumpin' oldies
so high off life, that bitch i could od
die twice, and come back the same nigga
lame niggas get up out of my lane nigga
before the big rig come through and run over your brain nigga

price on your head, and they trying to purchase
no matter the cost
hand over the cloth
cloth over the gun
gun over your jaw
bullet over your tongue
stick my dick inside hip-hop and shorty's sprung
every time i get a chance to come over, i overcome
over the snare drums
they say, "who fucking with you if you the god mc?"
i tell 'em nun
get it? i tell 'em nun
catholic nor christian, holding the book of psalms
in the back of my true religions
never passed the bar but
i ain't got to study law
just to judge lyrics
mmm, i should be the judge of lyrics
bang the gavel, give you a life sentence

whoever you are you can step

i see monsters in my head
that's why i rap with such aggression
i tear down studio sessions
rappers scared, they walk in the booth
with a bible and a reverend
i use my mouth as a weapon
bullets rip through your mid section
rat tat a tat tat tat rata tat tat tat
i'm a comptown, nigga get a casket
go against me, that'll lead to my advantage
because i've got to eat
and for real i'm feeling kind of famished
hotter than the earth core, don't show me where no fan is
show me where your fans is so they can see the real
i'm sick and electrifying, that's double ill
me feel like me will be a legend like will was a legend
but i'm not an actor, put that in my will
gimme a second uncut coke lyrics what i'm stressing
she want the raw so i fed her lines like kevin
tell 'em i'm a werewolf, behold the 5 6 bigfoot
lear jet overlook the country like garth brooks
lyrics on point, plus i got the right hooks
like tommy hearns, punchlines burn
i'm not concerned about the soundscan
cause most of y'all is drowning
a lifeguard that's lounging
meaning i don't worry about none of you rappers
i'm way more live
that's evil backwards
now with that great word play
i tend to let my words play
like children on a saturday
it's sad to say you're not up to par
and i don't play with mini golf and sharks
jump inside the pool of sharks, we're biting off your head, your heart, your legs, arms
bled like jay rock or big wy

welcome to my diary, stressing got me gray hairs
something to inspire me, rather than society's
woes, let me go, let me shine a lil' bit love
i want diamonds too, ronnie on player's club
i used to have a 9 to 5, fresh out of school that was '05
that bitch was racist, got me fired, ever since then i had no job
pushing in my mama van, stop for gas on rosecrans
trust me these niggas rushed me for something my cousin probably did
guilty by association story of my life, nigga
you gone make me flip then split your shit, judge give me life, nigga
pain since my grandma's death, uncle killed at louis's burgers
hold my tears i tried my best, let it go drench my pullover
cycles of a starving artist tryna go beyond the margin's margin
maintaining my modest, modest as i dream
so while i go through all this, all this bullshit what you call it
life itself i know it helps let me scroll through my blackberry

i said keep reading my diary, when my life's entirely
surrounded by the irony of living in the city
i said they wouldn't hire me, i said i got my ass beat
and the only thing can help is ass and some titties
so what's up, baby? i said what's up?
i had a long day and i really wanna fuck
see i ain't tryna think about no phone bills
credit card late fees, capital one popping up on my caller id
pawning my chain in the shop, watching for hollow-tip shots
watching my vehicle break down on another man's block
man that's my worst fear, ain't that your worst fear
you know when your transmission go out and can't switch gears
or run through a pothole at two in the morning
scared to hit your emergencies cause then they'll be on it
see i know when the harsh reality take its toll
open up your contacts then scroll

one time, reporting live, compton, california

she go to work, she go to school, her body smooth, no tattoos
type of girl that’ll make your mother feel comfortable
my pops love her too, she’s compatible, she’s independent
she handle her business, she believe in god and no other religions
she's never in competition, when it comes to her friends, she's dependable
she set her own trends, a confidant, a mediator, so sweet, every flavor
just a conversation with her doing you a favor, look at her hips, i want to be her pager
conservative, affirmative, actually she relaxing in sweats and bobby pins
the beauty of her, a blind man can see, a true queen and she needs me
she needs me, she needs me, she needs me, she needs me
the beauty of her, swear to god, a blind man can see, a true queen and she needs me


five years later, an accounting major, work at a firm
abundance of paper, she got a career, she look in the rear
view mirror of a mercedes that she can steer
call her boss, executive meetings, consecutive trips, vacational weekends
dior reeking through her prada dress, probably the only product of her pure success
got a promotion, now she own the building
headed to the top like she on the building, real estate, property
she order tender steak, only one mouth to feed, funded a youth center
invested in some stock, doubled what she put in, then bought a restaurant
oh what a girl, how great life can be, even though she got the world, she needs me
she needs me, she needs me, she needs me, she needs me
oh what a girl, wonder how her life can be, and though she got the world, she needs me


we lose touch, separated, years pass, i’m outdated
she’s dating one of hollywood’s famous entertainers, denzel good
paparazzi spot ‘em out shopping, tuesday morning brunch, benihana's
tabloids paint a picture of a perfect couple
headline reads when a famous actor loves you, emmy awards, academy too
on the red carpet, dress matching his suit, she holding his arm
she waves at her moms and wave at the world, got the world in her palms
head in the clouds, star gazing, caught her on the stage, a proposal was waiting
he bent down, got on one knee, she looked him in the eye and said she needs me
she needs me, she needs me, she needs me, she needs me
even if we seem to separate, eventually it’ll come to pass, and she’ll need me
i need her, we need we



c4, k.dot, let's get it (dj dave)
yeah, punch wanted me to come right in on the one
i didn't want to (dj ill will)
i love this beat
i love it so much, i can just listen to the instrumental
and don't rap
but i won't do that


light an incense for little kendrick, little, oh, kendrick
determination, my drive is like a thousand convertible engines
my adrenaline pump the blood of a warrior, chump, the apprentice
grown to be a man, 21 now, my heart in my hand
don’t get gunned down, i’m from compton, bitch
fuck a 6-4, we hit the kill switch
the other day i seen my nigga snows in the casket
darker skin tone, you can only imagine
the type of shit we on, murdered them dumb bastards
kill 'em inside their kitchen
and then stuffed them inside their cabinets
death before dishonor, put that on my mama
i'mma ride till i see the promise land, that’s a promise
llamas in the unfamiliar minivan
more drama only make more problems, but


they gotta get shot down
'cause we riding, we riding, we riding
they gotta get shot down
'cause we riding, we riding


like a black rodeo, .44’s, calicos
chop 'em up, stop 'em up like a stuffy nose
we supposed to be brothers, motherfuck ya
tuck your tail, bitch, hell is waiting on ya
while i’m praying on ya
not on my knees though, i mean preying on ya
i gotta feed, ho, and your death is nutritious to my appetite
after i eat, you’re sure to see afterlife
jesus christ, forgive me for my sins
because when you forgive me, i’m sure to sin again
i guess i’m a sinner, especially when i found out somebody killed my nigga
nigga, does anybody killer, fuck your creed, race, or color
son, daughter, sister, mother, brother gotta suffer
bitch, i’m cold hearted, till my arteries freeze
please hand me the keys to the g-ride
they outside then


they gotta get shot down
'cause we riding, we riding, we riding
they gotta get shot down
'cause we riding, we riding


somebody get ready for a murder
no more further announcements
mac-11 bouncing, the murder scene, coroner, yellow tape surrounding
either i retaliate or find self counseling
somebody got to die, simple mathematics
semi-automatic, watch them niggas panic and their hearts perish
or let's be diplomatic and less melodramatic
everything is vanity, think ecclesiastic
but what’s it all for, or what’s it all mean?
an eye for an eye means you and i won’t live to see
as our hearts bleed, we proceed cautiously
shoot them niggas down consciously, that’s how


they gotta get shot down
'cause we riding, we riding, we riding
they gotta get shot down
'cause we riding, we riding


ughh
yeah
kendrick lamar
ha ha haha ha

this feels like, right in front of the freeway
and when i'm done this should be in front of a dj
i watch whack rappers put their soul on ebay
then expect excellence knowing their effortless
i don't have a preference, i dislike all
say you run the globe? well more like a disco ball
i spread love as well
little nigga, big dreams, can bear-hug a whale into a lobster's tail
ugh
evacuate premises, rap's sinister suspicious
the pastor stand back, the bible is open, the words have been spoken
the moon and the stars align with the bars
the broads are snapping their bras in broad day
cops meeting their quota running for arcades
the three initial's on the pistols printed all k's
the end is almost near, inferior of nothing
superior is an option and my synopsis is that i'm frank sinatra
on the roster, top running
running races with my own shadow
look in the mirror then i start to battle
now a pyru is a crip, nor a pyru's just a value that is sure to be heard
like a fuckin sheep's cattle, niggas got some nerve
talkin bout they move birds
only thing i move now is a noun and a verb
i am now on the verge of telling the real story
of a compton native in the city "that kill for me"
cus you fabricated the realness
the county building and the county children on food stamps
glorifying street cred, talkin' about "whoop whamp"
but that's never the case
just a good lawyer who can sever the case
recording live from the city where the skinny niggas die and the semi bullets fly
drinking remy out bottle till the pain run dry
like a desert
once the desert eagle ride by, what you reppin?
what you reppin my nigga, you got a weapon?
well i got a profession my nigga
it's called hip-hop since pac was on gridlock
me against the world every hour, every second my nigga
you want something, get something
i could start a career and i can end one, i'm h1n1
ugh
straight-a student who flow stupid
real raps get permanent income, ugh

oh my god, he's alive, he dropped bombs on you intellects
bombin' everythin' from the streets to the internet
hear the instrumental wet
then i'm a bust a nut, yep, i'm a fuckin' nut
that is not an escalade, that's a damn armored truck
shoot who? shot what?
you ain't popped shit but some bubblegum and a bump
who you motherfuckers want?
leave a motherfucker slumped from the fuckin' pump
he's a peanut to an elephant, put that nigga in a trunk
might be out in houston, lean in my pimp cup
ride in '84s, throwed like a shot put
hoes on my jock like i'm from the atl
in our new block, choppers on the rooftop
flip a nigga like he was a nba mascot
strip a nigga from his wade cap to his two socks
got it from them compton blocks
raised from my grandpa's
every day, caught a fade like we like we own the barber shop
goons in the parkin' lot
who are you to fool if you bark a lot with no bite like an iguana
get killed right in front of your momma
hold tight, coroner comin'
summertime, perfect time for dove huntin'
and you a woman want to be at my house with her ass out
she climaxed and passed out
and promotional flyers, k-dot be the flyest
eat ten rappers a day, that's a hell of a diet
straight up like a kangaroo
pumpin' like a fist do from a pro-black
this is automatic rap, made a minute, take a second
i'm a get it maybe here for a minute when i'm finished
let's begin it

i'm tired of doing it the same way
gotta flip it before i ruin it
make it all make sense
before you put your 2 in it
opinions get thrown out the window
with ron browz so turn me up loud
so the world can hear
and when your favorite rapper
be rapping you should cover your ears
and go deaf, go deaf i said
go death and stay dead
a shot to the forehead'll kill em
but i ain't here for no ignorance
i’m militant, as martin luther king
in the penitent, aiming for my dreams
till a bullet bounce off
one of my deep thoughts
and hit a nigga in the spleen
i got it in my genes
you probably think i'm talking bout a pistol
but i'm talking bout the blood of a warrior
my nigga what you worry for?
i ain't trying to jock your swag
i'm trying to better my craft and stay relevant


yeah, as time flies
hope that i'm soaring
far from the boring
i'ma
tell you why
it's important
i'm not the boring, (i'ma)
if i think and act like you do
the world would die
from not seeing something new
and if i don't speak on how i feel
the world would lose out on
what's really real
and if i should die before i wake
i pray my music will take my place
the world
the relevant


id rather you call me that
then a typical artist you call wack
on a youtube blog holding ar's and stacks
of one's but never could be the one
to rally communities or
lead a crowd of blacks
passion is to strong
im pissed off
so there's a chance you get pissed on
r kelly was in the wrong
but that dont make you an exempt
that dont make you a no go from hittin the fence
you ain't a blood and
damn sure you ain't a crip
the crowd yell oh!
but i ain't a pimp
im me, im free as a 5 finger discount
see you on the flipside
right after i dismount, if i
ever feel like i ain't pushin myself
ill find a cliff then push myself
off the edge like a barber
at the tip of your head
thats how i settle it
life or death if i ain't relevant


yeah, as time flies
hope that i'm soaring
far from the boring
i'ma
tell you why
it's important
i'm not the boring, (i'ma)
if i think and act like you do

and if i should die before i wake
i pray my music will take my place

so feel free to not mind me
if your used to boosters
drug dealers and shooters its on wax
cause most of yall niggas fabricate facts anyway
i could have easily cheat and let the 44 play
like a 2 on 2 orgy
but i been there and it bores me
got to the point where it did nothing for me
at 40 i want to afford not to record bullshit
in my story, and im mad young so id rather do it now
before my careers done, this is pain plus glory
victory is here, if i cried
you could see strength and pride in my tears
i do it for the kids, i do it for the 23
hour lockdowns doin time in the pen
and my pen is the only thing i got for
hip hop to change the game
they'll remember my name as the relevant


yeah, as time flies
hope that i'm soaring
far from the boring
i'ma
tell you why
it's important
i'm not the boring, (i'ma)

how was your flight mr. lamar?
good, hope to see you next time

i was sitting on the couch reading yellow paper
a letter in reply, 7 days later after i wrote 'em
"stay strong, keep your faith in god," what i told him
hoping that he's listening
said that they tried to give him like a hundred years
what a coincidence, i was bumping some plies
i can taste the salt from my tears
as the water had start to flood on my eyes
i know it gotta be hard being 21
doing time in the pen and your gram's old
your brother's getting older
and the streets is getting colder
and your hoping that he's focused to stay on the right road
sleeping in a cell, it's been 30 weeks
ain't recieved any mail
it's cold and the hole stinks
and you can't even blink without niggas testing your life
as i read every word that you write, i can only imagine
jason keaton, i can only imagine


sitting on the couch, that was my uncle bobby
after he just got out, 15 years to count
haven't seen the world in so long
haven't seen a girl in so long
and before the sun came up, he was gone
like a fiend off the best rock
trying to get his life together, or what not
typed his name in the system and they couldn't find his identity
got it straight, got a place, found some serenity
found a job, found his mother's grave site, found a 40 ounce
then he found god, then he bounced, then he found a new chick
two kids, wide hips, found something in her we didn't see
found this spot in pasadena and shack with her, an investment
then found guilty, somebody had yelled domestic
violence on my uncle, was working with two strikes
only out a year, now facing life
i can only imagine
that's fucked up
i can only imagine, uncle bob


sitting on the couch, thinking about the ratio
of blacks in prison as compact in prison
when blacks pack with minorities
system grab more of these 18 year olds
18 year sentence with no parole
the state won't oversee
they make the term severe, a conspiracy?
that's what i call it, it's full of shit
a toilet can help quick, the government help?
no, just put us on death row
just give us some more guns, then give us some more coke
then give us another chair, then give us some more rope
then hang it like right there, yeah
it's justice for all but 90 percent unfair
care? no
alcatraz was purchased by a white man
for 5 grand, with intentions to expand
more prisons
so these correctionals ain't for rehabilitation
they for grossing a bigger business
imagine
we're being used
imagine
the truth shall be told



sometimes i wanna leave, sometimes i wanna cry
sometimes i hate to bear the truth, sometimes i wanna lie
sometimes i wanna school the youth, sometimes i wanna ride
sometimes i wanna not think, sometimes i wanna vibe
sometimes i wwanna bump tribe and zone out
this song's 'bout a young boy that's gone wild inside
when my world collide
with your world where your girl and your kids reside
we killed the facades, we feel free to fly
we're birds that reserve in the charismatic sky
i care about my pride too much
if my clothes is new, if my ride is plush
if my hair is cut, if my diamonds is crushed
i look in the mirror, i'm trendy enough? wrong
insecurity roams the black community
homes where kids must have jewelry
the high school female need earrings and details
so she can be cool to be amongst popularity
the various name brands that reached the price scan
it's not about the right price but more like the right scam
to rule us all, confuse us all
hit the bank within five minutes and then withdraw
now let's draw
the picture of a rapper with a chain and range that is not paid for
my cousin from the south said he just bought him a house
that lives around his neck like a white collar
so why fast forward? then i'll rewind, a time machine can help me double back to slavery times
pickin' cotton from a field that a white man own
the blacker you are farther you from the white man's home
negro spiritual songs, gave us some type of sanity
before your vanity, they parted our families
they put us in hundred degree shade and outside we bathed
the more we were afraid, the more they made rules
and trapped our minds in a cage, our freedom was so vague
couldn't see it with the eyes of tracee ross, uh
and school was exempt, see we couldn't have smarts
and a smirk could get you hurt, wounded first from a scar
four-hundred years of nothin', four-hundred years of sufferin'
four-hundred years of tears and tribulations, miseducation
see what we facin' is now comin' back to the roots
remember whips on our back and if we would run they would shoot
called us niggers and figured that we'd never live in pursuit
of happiness, we capture these feelings in things that we do
thought of abstinence of slavery but we made it come to
about a perspective, my shoe selection gotta be louie
her hand bag gotta be gucci, it's fake then she fool me
she still bad though and her fake gucci ain't that bad though
we fillin' up the gas for rollies
upgrade to twenty-sixes after ridin' kobes
my cousin from the south, slavery start in the south and i bet ya
he overcompensate for the life of his ancestors
so blame it on the four-hundred years we never saw
the reason why the next four-hundred we gotta floss
slaves


i said the four-hundred years we never had nothin'
barely had clothes on our back
is the reason why when we get a little bit of change
we over exaggerate on our livin' expenses
so if you get your first big check and you cop a chain before you buy a house
you're a vanity slave
if you're a female and you got four, five, six rings on your finger
four holes in your left ear and a nose piercin'
you're a vanity slave
if you got an '02 monte carlo with twenty-fours on it
and on the back of the window it says, "get on my level, ho"
you're a vanity slave
we all vanity slaves
so with that being said, can somebody please tell me where the mall at?
i'm not from around here, hey, ali, where we at? idaho?
yeah, nigga, you know the first of the month, checks comin' in
i'm tryna get some
what up?

so they looking for me
they don't know
i'm waiting on them
right here, i'ma sit by the window
see they gonna have to get me
yeah, they gonna have to get me
come get me


damn shame, why they let me get a champagne, uh
the young can produce thunder, i make black rain, uh
blood stain saw all over his black range, uh
catch him at the lights to turn off his lights mane
life been treating me right so i can't complain, uh
career 'bout to take flight, g4 plane (yep)
i stunt niggas growth in this rap shit
suggest you react quick or invest in some globe games
i'm propane and hard liquor, bow down to who
what nigga, toss bullets like flea flickers
to the fullest, i'ma get it to the core
and they tape pictures, yellow tape, stretched out, inches
i can't wait like the first day of school
waking up, three in the morning, looking at my shoes
but this time around, i be looking are my tool
wiping it down, 
hm, i'm surprise
ya'll not here yet
plans must have change
but i'm still here
i even let the backdoor open
come on now


kill 'em, kill 'em, send 'em to the morgue
let 'em fill him with a brimming fluid
we ain't sorry for nothing
we ain't tryna play hardcore nothing
but you overdid it when you push the button
so we caught the ussr, push the button on it
let it blew up a few cars
you really don't want it 
so ya'll still ain't here
so i guess there's a first time for everything if ya'll don't come
but i'm still here
in fact i'm still waiting for someone else
punch


i'm restless know
ya'll took to long
maybe next time
or maybe even i come to you
hm, but for know
i'ma just get my

it's like i don't think you fully understand who i am, ya know?
i'm just a good kid from compton that wanna rap
i don't represent no colors, i represent my lil' sisters and brothers
i'm the oldest, nigga
and if you can't respect that, your whole perspective is wack
check it out


i used to wanna rap like jay-z
until i finally realized that jay wasn't me
i took my time to jot down every line that's a quotable
critics say i don't be killing this shit but i know i do
because i used to practice early morning and then after school
i'm working on my hooks my nigga, i ain't tryna battle you
but even if i did, i guarantee i'd overshadow you
like a fucked up taper that turned to bowl cut
i'mma close cut to common and gucci mane
now that's a comparison that you probably wouldn't understand
because i can touch the people and still keep it ghetto
as an '87 regal with the tree air freshener on the rearview mirror
i wear a heart on my shoulder
'member when we used to make the boost look like motorola?
your cousin fucked up your room every time he came over
then went to jail when we got older
that shit is a bad odor, but still i remain focused
in due time, i'll be able to swipe my card and it won't say decline
that shit's embarrassing huh
hope no one pay you no mind
but it's a bad bitch behind you while you standing in line
can you relate to my story? can you follow my dreams
and admirations that i had ever since i was thirteen?
my momma believed in me, she let me use her van to go to the studio
even though she know her tank is empty, that's who i do it fo'
my pops got a different approach, yeah he believed
but he always questioned when i'mma drop my debut cd
how long this gon' take nigga? you still haven't ate nigga
at twenty-two i had two cars and my own place nigga
it's a sacrifice i try to tell him
that's when he turn to bet and tell me that he jealous
of all these niggas getting money and their shit don't sound like shit
i ain't tryna kill your confidence or forcing you to quit
i just wanna hear you heard


yep, yep, that's my word
make a statement with these nouns and verbs
i represent the liquor that's poured out on the curb
listen to my nouns and verbs (man, i wanna be heard)
like a cattle with sheep
while y'all sleep i be up, cooking up all day
like a mad scientist in that laboratory
motherfuck what a critic got to say, i'ma be heard


what up dzyne? i ain't forgot nigga
you developed me, telling me i was hot nigga
you believed in me first, that's what's for sure
at the church recording, at the garage, but it worked
but me and dave kind of felt you lost the passion
a lot was going on in your life and you needed space
but still i should have came to you first to tell you what happened
but i was seventeen and figured it's best i stay away
and i was wrong, i was young and couldn't look you in the eye for what i'd done
but i'm telling you we ain't done
matter of fact, how's your sons? what they up to?
remember they used to run away while you had worked on protools?
people i used to be in the booth till four in the morning
with school in the morning, yawning, but i was on it
me, you and dave was on it
buzzing like charlotte hornets when that tape dropped
where them beats nigga? it's been five years since we had rocked
time to be heard


yep, yep, that's my word
make a statement with these nouns and verbs
i represent the liquor that's poured out on the curb
listen to my nouns and verbs (man, i wanna be heard)
like a cattle with sheep
while y'all sleep i be up, cooking up all day
like a mad scientist in that laboratory
motherfuck what a critic got to say, i'ma be heard


so can you feel it?
when you hear it do it pulsate your spirit?
do it make you wanna say motherfuck a gimmick?
the truth can set you free if you do the right thing
word to spike lee, don't he look like sounwave?
that's kinda random, but my humor sometimes strays
like a dog in the night
twenty-four hours in a day but only take five minutes
to grab a pad and a pen, then send your dog a kite
i spread love like a hippy, but i'm a black one
with jesus christ passion, i swear on the bible
tabernacle to all my rivals, i ain't mad
you hate a nigga for tryna help you, that's your bad
because i figure i can make a way with these stanzas
i probably can't heal cancer, but i can heal the city
my niggas, tell me you with me
and if you is won't you pop my cd in
open up your trunk, then let it bump, so i can be heard
yeah, uh huh


yep, yep, that's my word
make a statement with these nouns and verbs
i represent the liquor that's poured out on the curb
listen to my nouns and verbs (man, i wanna be heard)
like a cattle with sheep
while y'all sleep i be up, cooking up all day
like a mad scientist in that laboratory
motherfuck what a critic got to say, i'ma be heard


d-dave, what up nigga?

moving through the block like a centipede
no rooftop, who hot? i'mma show them where the antifreeze
i hit the dealership, and tell them hand me keys, like a grand pianist
damage anything said, then landing on top of your bitch, oops i tripped
i'm clumsy like michelle williams, or jaleel white
i feel like a predator, and none of you danny glovers are ready for, alien tactics
the god is back, they're on their knees praying like a mantis
as i perform like santa clause
pause tvs in the phantom
bitches on my left and my right like i pant them
dancing on the coast, emerging from the smoke
pimping in my blood, tell doc to check my pulse
they knew that was k.dot the gemini, with another cut like a samurai
anything else is uncivilized
fucker

whoo ha!
backpack raps with gats in it
don't get your cap peeled by the black menace
k-dot thoroughbred

a forced to be reckoned with, fuck with the best shit
like the strongest manure, i'm ready when you are
this is it, i'm in the lab cooking up all day
fuck 'em up all day like a nympho
i been dope since s curl waves
trying to convince hoes i got good hair
knowing damn well there's chemicals there
i'm in the hood with the 17 year-olds that's on hood patrol
and they want stripes, so they shoot off bikes
and you know any moment you can lose your life
so kiss your kids and hug your wife, and what not yo
i spar with a dragon, he tried to throw a flame
but i ducked, then i stabbed him and came out the battle laughin'
that's a metaphor for any rapper who wants it
i smack 'em til their nose is running
you know the hoes is coming if i'm there
and the hoes is cumming once we hit the hotel
there's no assumptions
cool out before i move out, hop on the 105
do about 105 before your ass gets threw out the back seat
(there's a dead guy on the freeway)
oh, it's not dot? tell the medics it's okay
a beast when the beat break
you probably think i'm dope like this the realest shit i wrote
but to me, it's a throw-away
i stare at the four walls and rap like i'm mad at god
nice enough to throw a spear at nas
launch at jay, matter fact, let me take that back
see i don't fuck with real legends in rap like you do
i'm crucial, concealed by real crips and suwoo
and they shoot like photography students when beef gets to brewing


is it real, son? is it really real, son?
is it really real, son? is it really real?
tell me how you feel, son, tell me how you feel, son
tell me how you feel, son, tell me how you feel
you rappers got nothing for me when sound-sounwave record me
every mc, i'm sure to rip them, i guarantee you will forgive them


is it real, son? is it really real, son?
is it really real, son? is it really real?
tell me how you feel, son, tell me how you feel, son
tell me how you feel, son, tell me how you feel
you rappers got nothing for me when sound-sounwave record me
every mc, i'm sure to rip them, i guarantee you will forgive them


straight up, don't get ate up
put rappers in quicksand, dot leaned on 'em like kickstands
i'm so hot, kids put me in their ipod
even atheists play my shit and say, "my god, jesus, joseph, and mary, he's nice"
don't compare me to them, just compare me to mike jordan
when i record and the verse and the chorus is ill
you can land in lab of fortune when biting my skills, playa'
watch i lay-up bar after bar like i'm trying to build a gate up
see me on the way up like an elevator, i'mma let you take the stairs
that metaphor meaning i'm already there (greatness)
i'm in the booth with an apron
cooking up shit like martha stewart was my bitch, amen
stay on the curb like a spray day tan?
blowing herb with my nigga herb, fuck what you niggas heard
we the new west coast wu tang bitch and i'm the best
think less, you can suck my dick
who from the west can kill it like us? give me their name
now i take 'em to the house of pain, top dawg headquarters


is it real, son? is it really real, son?
is it really real, son? is it really real?
tell me how you feel, son, tell me how you feel, son
tell me how you feel, son, tell me how you feel
you rappers got nothing for me when sound-sounwave record me

let's get this money
i feel like rapping tonight people

don't be mad..


cuz i'm young and i'm black and my hat's real low
if you don't like my lyrics you can press fast forward


look, why i always feel that i'm hot?
why i always feel i should drop another jewel
like martin on blue streak while you dudes get tattooed
with permanent scars, i'm always bullying y'all
i'm always righteous to think that life is what you make it
i'm always thinking of r&b bitches butt-naked
i'm always on point, like a snitch on the go
but i never snitch my car's the only thing i towed on
i'm always keeping it moving, middle finger up
like i practice celibacy, i don't give a fuck
just wait, i'm at they heads like a toupee yeah
it's like that, your cranium never survive titanium bars
harder than my dick when the tip gets licked, quick
run for cover like winter's here then listen here
k. dot you'll never shake me loose
like a tied knot off the goose, you mad at me too?


cause i'm young and i'm black and my hat's real low (i can't front)
if you don't like my lyrics you can press fast forward
i can't front, i can't front sometimes i feel like..


yo, why you always critiquing my shit
why don't you hop on your own dick like marilyn manson
i'm dancing with 2 brains, so if i got shot in the head
i won't die i'll just lose more game, propane walking
you could sell my words at an auction for the right price
and be rich your whole life, straight up
i wanna see the world by 35 but for right now i'm compton bound
hit rosecrans with a pocket full of dividends
big truck speed through the light, run over civilians
pimp cut bitch on my right, hat low like a stripper ass
when she hit the floor, doing my thing, why you complain?
cause i'm young and i'm black and i rap like a nigga got a
angel on his back, wait a minute i means business
you homosexual with it, i give you straight lyrics
now that's an emcee, that's why you mad at me?


cause i'm young and i'm black and my hat's real low
if you don't like my lyrics you can press fast forward (fuck ya!)
check me out..


what i write is a like a bomb device, press play
and you can die tonight
shook ones don't exist whenever that k. dot spit
off the chain like fast pedaling while riding a bike
i gets my ride on, you ride too
but like scion, now that's a damn shame
i'm hogging up both lanes
play your part, styles like kevin hart
they're so plain
i'm choking while i'm smoking on this strongest hocus pocus
chocking with punch
he sarcastic laughing cause i said that i can freestyle better than kurupt
now that's a statement that hopefully i can back up
see kurupt is a legend, that's where i get my shit from
straight lab rat, spit it once run it back
like a punt return, they tell me wait my turn
so that's what i'mma do, lay in the cut like a 2 shot dillinger
killing these niggas in high pursuit waddup



god feel me

childhood friends become enemies
don’t pay’em no mind
do your mind like they did kennedy's
closed casket
ghetto boys world where we make the murder bracket
high shore taxes
high by the dead beat daddy’s and the mama’s who can smoke the rock the fastest
so he tote llamas middle finger to ya
i never fuck hoes with no condom
not a high school graduate
hustlin is where his passion is
hit the blunt then passin it, hit the bottle then passin it
hit the gas, hit the brake, hoppin out, blastin it
where da cash, where da safe?
a robbery’s taking place
give it to him willingly; he’s killing you anyway because it thrills him
you can almost see his adrenaline pumping
hey young world we are the children


it’s a young boys world out here
we gotta dredge-it up and down these blocks you got to know
it’s a young boys world out here


i swear to god you gotta feel me

gangsta down to the socks
wankstas betta beware tryin to be what you not
just look at his position and the city he live in
bang the hood like a head on car collision

knocking on they doors telling neighbors mind they business
cause 9s can finish off any eyewitness
don’t call the lieutenant miss parker he meant it
i’m the author of these delinquents that got you timid
see to you he’s a menace but to me these my niggas
i do this shit for my niggas locked up in that system
jason head hold ya head
jewel keep written sentences
maybe these jail sentences nothing but a young boys demise
and a reminder every time you walk outside


feel me, feel me
real talk, what's up


look, my nigga just had a daughter
only way to feed his daughter
said he hustlin harder hope no charges get brought up
tryin to stay out of gunplay so he see her tomorrow
back inside the gunplay soon as his homies call him
for that mission again on they mission again
pop another blue pill then feel relentless again
waking up in cold sweats see the image again
nightmares of his victims keep on visiting him
plus his people keep telling him use your common sense
so he tell’em retaliation is commencing
that’s all they know as a compton kid
living only for the moment fuck a consequence
his accomplishments lies deep within
the black heart that hoes be hatin violence
use violence as his defense so in his defense remain militant
i’m the voice of hell that we livin' in
so when the devil got they tongue, i be speakin' for them
talk to me,  talk to me

i’m the voice of hell that we be livin
so when the devil got they tongue i be speakin for them
yung boys


it’s a young boy's world out here
i said i'm out here baby i said i’m out here baby
if you livin in this life blessed one day at a time
it's your world young boy you can heal or destroy
make it wrong or make it right
it's your world you decide
said it's yours young boy
said it's yours young boy
oh oh oh hey hey yaya baby yaya baby
