said i'm a fuckin' monster, a massive attack, i haunt ya
i mastered the rap, then fucked up the monitors, mastered that
after that, i went for thermometers, popped 'em all, then popped in the
jaw of tracy veronica, holla back, they promised us
no pajamas, insomnia, will attack, i attack like piranha does
hit your block like a comet- blah! and you all know what time it is
2012, mark your calendars, calisthenics and silencers
exercisin' that trigger strap, rock with us, metallica
competition no talent, hmm, in the jungle, what's wild enough?
just might stumble upon a pack of lions
no lyin', my soldiers dyin', this is iraq, alliances
lining with stars and bars of a prison rep, my science a-
-pplyin' pressure, her stretcher is needed, pay the proceeds
or you live in debt, y'all soft as a giga-pet, you niggas can't see me
unless you watchin' the tv or ultra huggin' my silhouette
my flow got the ceiling wet, i spit 'til i feel my breath
who sinkin' my fuckin' chest? she fuckin' the fuckin' best
mean my dick is the dick of death, mean i'm killin that pussy
like spike whenever that jerry slept


yeah, dre
me and andre the giant, 6'7 and climbin'
whether you storm to your climate, whether you're beat makin' or rhyming
bumpin some phyllis hyman, hand full of diamonds like jay fans
on a island with ray bans, glasses palmin' asses
that probably came wit' a great tan, hehe
i be the motherfuckin' mecca of this hub city spectrum
where they at? i will dissect them like a fucking frog's rectum
why you wreckin' with irreputable? my worst flow incredible
they probably call the federal after i slaughter several
etcetera, etcetera, bentley passin' up celicas
they tellin' us about shit, hiiipower in your mouth, bitch
and top dawg can vouch, bitch, nigga, what you 'bout?
about face with army outfits, the general's here
that mean the hustlers and the criminals here
penitence reachin' pinnacles of life and despair
and me i solemnly swear to handle mine like a taliban and die for it
only difference is i ain't never askin' allah for it
only difference is i be spazzin' and still a proud poet
put me in a category, i don't know what's a sadder story
guts and glory, your pain bore me you ain't really lived it
i take you to a block where they crippin'
or piru that 5'2 gun bigger than the torso of pippen
bitch, i been doin' it
before you niggas ruined it, show me somethin' different
you either kissin' dick or givin' me distance
you live in a district of dimebags and dummies, i know your statistics
who your boss? he more like my assistant
get lost, have a egg and a biscuit
break fast when we aimin' them biscuits
pay cash when your chain come up missin'
q! q!

you somethin' different, i'm glad i found you
so pretty, i'll never do anythin' to hurt you

the hardest thing for me to do
is to get you, to know me, within sixteen bars
that's the hardest thing


who is k. dot? a young nigga from compton
on the curb writing raps next to a gunshot
on the corners where the gangsters and the killers dwell
the fraudulent tender scars that get unveiled
everyone i knew was either crip or piru
cousins in elementary, relatives in high school
with that being said, each one of their rivals
was aiming something at my head, i needed survival
got jumped, got jacked, shot at, shot back
and i don't even push a line, i'm just tryna push these rhymes
in the midst of staying neutral and discrete
my momma said you're judged by the company you keep
but what you can consider, that if it goes down
they'll kill you if you kill me, it gets deep nigga
so if you ask what i'm doing
i'm tryna duck the influence of my city that's brewing, real talk, and


this is why they fuck with me (real talk nigga, believe it)
this is why they fuck with me (do what i do, ya know?)
i'm no gangster, no killer, i'm just your average joe (know that)
but one thing you should consider, i'm the realest you know


i was walking from centennial
when an unidentified vehicle rolled up, and i was like "hol' up"
"where you from?" i don't bang
"where you stay?" westside, that's a piru gang to be exact
well aware they had blue across they hat
dropped backpack and ran inside of the cul-de-sac
shots rang out, hoping to god i wasn't wet
crossed across rosecrans and ran inside of the yet
chirped the homies on the i-95, they said they already knew
what happened, and meet 'em outside the garage
never seen that many guns in my life
i was paranoid like a fiend in the night, but needed revenge
grabbed the nine-ball, opened up the door, then got in
somebody said, "fall back, we gon' make these niggas suffer
you my brother like a frat, and that's just to remind you"
thought about that so long i had failed my finals, fuck, but


this is why they fuck with me (i told you, nigga)
this is why they fuck with me (you fake nigga)
i'm no gangster, no killer, i'm just your average joe (you fake)
but one thing you should consider, i'm the realest you know


i don't do black music, i don't do white music
i do everyday life music
give 'em cuts like a nigga pierced a knife through it
you say you through, but i've been through it, now that's cold
and this is for my county building children
in hub city on hubcaps, no power-steering
i use perseverance in this mad city
where the niggas drink remy and hold semis for cutthroats
bernie mac died, it's no joke
don't ask why if you don't know about these killers and thieves
seven grams of weed, you smoke that, but i'm high off life
i could fall out the sky like twice
and land in the land of the aks
and the minivans where the fan never on
cause it's hotter than a lunatic's underarms in a straight jacket
in other words, we get it cracking, but i keep it cool, you know?


this is why they fuck with me (haha)
this is why they fuck with me (real talk)
i'm no gangster, no killer, i'm just your average joe (come on)
but one thing you should consider, i'm the realest you know


so there you have it
but i'mma leave you with this
an o.g. once told me
a real gangster is either dead or in jail
or behind the scenes getting real money
i'm gone

one time
reporting live
compton, california


have you ever felt like, like you never get life?
like you never did right, sort of like a black sheep?
back down, backing out your dreams like some bad sleep
chasing for the wind but you never win the track meet
oh, what a cold world for a broke nigga, it's bitter
and life's a bitch, don't hit women, so i bit her
i struck enough pain let her know i wasn't playing
i was so sincere like nas' first name in belly
they tell me, it's very difficult to see 25
and if i survive it's probably with a celly
my opportunities are low because my brown complexion floats
in the ghetto rather in some heels like giuseppe's
they want me unemployed, until i hit the streets
fulfilling voids of broke d-boys selling weed
fucking up my prestige, 'til i live with the blues
bb king or the neighbors of snoop, that's why i'm


in the club like fuck it, though
they say it's only one life, life, life
and if you say i can't live comfortable
i'ma tell you that's a lie, lie, lie
so while i hold this bottle of ciroc with a hand full of ass
celebrate the very day that i get past
through the barbed wire
we are, we are (fighters)
we are, we are (true)
through the, through barbed (wires)
we will, will break (through)
so while i hold this bottle of ciroc with a hand full of ass
celebrate the very day that i get past
through the barbed wire


have you ever felt like, like you never get life?
like you never did right, sort of like a black sheep?
tryna get away from the world's stereotype
barbed wire got a barricade on your destiny, she desperately
in need of some inspiration, see what the people saying
she gon have a baby then flee from her education
at the age of 16, credit card scam schemes
see a scar on her eye, boyfriend brutality
she'll never get by, no how, no way
welfare recipient, property of the state
housing, section 8, corner store prostitute
the owner bout to prosecute, the niggas tell her that she's cute
hoodrat trashy, six baby daddies
and this baby daddy is new to the family
chilling in pajamis, waiting on the first
fast forward spilling drinks on her fur, that's why she


in the club like fuck it, though
they say it's only one life, life, life
and if you say she can't live comfortable
she gon' tell you that's a lie, lie, lie
so while she up in vip pouring merlot in the glass
celebrate the very day that she get past
through the barbed wire
we are, we are (fighters)
we are, we are (true)
through the, through barbed (wires)
we will, will break (through)
so while she up in vip pouring merlot in the glass
celebrate the very day that she get past
through the barbed wire


have you ever felt like, you finally got life
you finally got right? no longer a black sheep
living off ya dreams like christina uh-milian
in the front seat of a convertible eloping to get married
what a feeling of overcoming the odds
it's like we just hit the lottery, my god
there must be a god, cause golly
you done made it through the fight while squabbling ali
now ya lifestyle's looking up and you escaped the crooked cuffs
and you ain't have to kill a nigga just to make a couple bucks
and she ain't have to go and fuck on everybody for a dollar
making good decisions, got a independent business-mind
and both of y’all are steady grindin', doing it the legal way
just tryna make a decent pay on every second of the day
but they won't give you the credit, disses out they mouth
you must have joined the illuminati just to ball out


in the club like fuck it, though
they say it's only one life, life, life
and if you say they can't live comfortable
they gone tell you that's a lie, lie, lie
so even if you overcame doubt and ya living ain't bad
know it's a barbed wire that's always in your path
through the barbed wire (just laugh)
then everybody say...
'cause i won't get caught again
and i'm here to stop the trends
you can catch me if you try
disappear into the night
and i'm gone


so you made it past all the barbed wires?
there's one more left *gunshot*

ali, you thirsty on twitter!
you boo-boo, you t'd
you turned down, you thirsty
you boo-boo!


uh, i'm tryna learn something new
i'm tryna find myself, i'm searching deep for kendrick lamar
i read about napoleon hill and try to know god
they say he the key to my blessings, and if i speak the good
into existence, that instant my dreams will unlock
money flow like water, i'll just wait at the dock
and by the way i'ma start, finding more light to shed
like a small garage in your backyard
i'm back chilling with a friend of mine, she mighty fine
but i notice that her heart resides next to bitterness
always hollering who she don't like and who she kick it with
who she wanna fight, who wearing a weave
who dooney and bourke bag is fake, who holding the keys
to the car she drove last year or who fucking on who
and who need a pap smear, getting on my nerves
but before your negative energy curve, bitch i'ma cut you off


'cause every time you come around
you be hollering that whoop-de-whoop, blah-zay-blah
he say, she say, oh my god
shut the fuck up... hoe
every time you come around
you be hollering that whoop-de-whoop, blah-zay-blah
he say, she say...


uh, i'm tryna learn something new
i'm tryna surround myself with people that inspire me
or at least inquire similar desires
to do what it t-a-k-e just to reach the t-o-p
i'm talking ideas, motivation
it's more than making, enemies, my nigga
oh, that's not ya memo? then tell me why you constant stressing
on how you well connected like centipedes, my nigga
i function with you and you flaunt your pistol
every second tell me how you pressed 'em at the monte cristo
where so and so from, and what neighborhoods beefing
who baby momma's a rat, and who got killed last weekend
that shit is mad depressing, bringing me down
speak on somethin' with some substance that can get us both paid
rather than telling me how these niggas jocking your style
or his rims ain't bigger, pussy nigga, i'ma cut you off


'cause every time you come around
you be hollering that whoop-de-whoop, blah-zay-blah
he say, she say, oh my god
shut the fuck up... scary ass
every time you come around
you be hollering that whoop-de-whoop, blah-zay-blah
he say, she say


uh, i'm tryna learn something new
i'm tryna better my chances of becoming a star
i'm tryna feel the vibe of mona lisa
studying art... now paint that picture
life behind bars, remember the very day i got caught?
i murdered a rapper, and you filed the police report?
see what i was taught, family is all i need
but indeed them too can run me right up a tree
constantly talking shit 'bout the next relative
wanting me to take sides, but i'd never give in
ever since grandma died, everyone parted ways
argue on holidays, left my uncle in prison
for 15 years, no one paid him attention but moms
yeah, my momma as loyal as any sister would come
come to my house just to yap about your own people
dang, and if your blood wasn't running through my veins
i would prolly cut y'all off too, yep


'cause everytime y'all come around
y'all be hollering that whoop-de-whoop, blah-zay-blah
he say, she say, oh my god, shut the fuck up
keep it running, ali
every time you come around
you be hollering that whoop-de-whoop, blah-zay-blah
he say, she say


so tell 'em, "shut the fuck up!"
tell 'em, "shut the fuck up!"
yeah, bitch, you boo-boo, you t'd
you turnt down, you thirsty
tell 'em "shut the fuck up!"
tell 'em "shut the fuck up!"

you boo-boo, you t'd
you turnt down, you weak
you weak, yo’ bitch weak
yo- (laughs)
you boo-boo, you t (laughs)
keep all that


what is hiiipower?
hiiipower is the way we think, the way we live
see it’s known today that the human race is nothing
no morals, no standards
what we’re about to do is raise the level of expectations
no, you don’t have to have a lot of money
you don’t have to be rich
but you will be rich in mind and spirit
some say it’s as big as a crew, some say it’s as big as a gang
hiiipower, we stand for it as if it’s as big as a religion

and this is for the homies
i'm talking bout the swap meets, rollie
chain-wearing niggas with the white tee
baby tell the truth, yeah you know we...


somebody get ready to pass me the hit of that endo, i'm tryna get blown
i'm tryna get turned up like the fifteens in my cadillac brougham
looking for e.t. to phone home
tadow, the flavor i kick reminisce the good days
thinking back when we used to run in the swap meet for the rollie chains
pro club t-shirts, whiter than anglo-saxons
make it a 1x-tall, crispy with the cotton fashion
that's fashion if you come where i'm from
compton california, one love to the murder capital under the sun
young niggas running around the street with heat bigger than me
but i don't trip, i still dip like salsa to a chip
rolling down rosecrans to scoop up my man, a-mack
he talking about some foolishness on how we can pick up on some hoes, believe that
and so i scooped him round 3:30, telling me it's all good
tiger woods, now we looking for the birdy birdies
stopped at the sto' to get some rubbers
pulled up on the breezies, well what do you know? i think they love us


and this is for the homies
i'm talking bout the swap meets, rollie
chain-wearing niggas with the white tee
baby tell the truth, yeah you know we got it going on
and if you feel good (hey)
raise your hands high and throw up your hood (hey)
represent the city like you know you should (hey)
i want to make sure that you understood we got it going on
(is that right? is that right?) we got it going on
(is that right? is that right?) we got it going on
(is that right? is that right?) we got it going on
(is that right? is that right?) we got it going on


as i continue my day, quite copacetic
headed to my momma's house to see what them greens are talking bout, hungry as hell
had the right grub, i bail, need some gas
arco station on avalon, a relative hit me up as he rolled past
we used to stand in line for jordans, excited we got 'em
rocking platinum fubu jeans with rubber bands tied to the bottom
throwback jerseys, chamberlain and james worthy was two of my favorites
i might pull out the green larry bird on special occasions
but anyway i'm steady coasting, smoking on that hiroshima
ashtray got a million roaches, i'm focussed but feeling good
the homies hanging on {?} and monte carlos
impalas and tahoes, shoot something nigga, break that fifty
i'm grabbing the city like i'm supposed to
making my presence felt like christmas day, what can i say?
every vocal is spoken with the wisdom of a g
if you can't relate then please have a seat




so, wherever you located, won't you let it be known
and put on for the soil of which you was grown
i put on like brand new chuck taylors
while giving you cuts like fresh tapers
i'm such a fool with it, go nuts
you bullshitting like tuck, the bounce then untuck
the bounce then throw up, a rare jewel, you duck
take 'em to school i must, this for the cool in us
this ain't for you, so what?!



where are we going? why are we slowing down?
where are you going? we should be growing now
smoke to it nigga, smoke to it nigga, oh
where are we going? we should be slowing down
where are you going? we should be growing now


that’s what she said to me, that place i used to call home
is just a bed to me
and we don’t even sleep, neighbors can hear her weep
meanwhile i’m in these streets with everybody, i’m trying to get it
and she know they got me, i watch her feelings watch me
as they staring with the saddest eyes of loneliness
look each other in the face and barely blink
i tried to make it right, but the pen ran out of ink
so if my letters don’t reach you, i hope these lyrics in sync


that’s what it said to me
but the place i call ambition now dead to me
gone and forgotten, i’m off track like dale earnhardt
my liver rotten, alcoholic tripping
fucking bad bitches and they got bad intentions
club night, guys and dolls
balling out but i'm 'bout to drop the ball
i’m calling out for help, my engineer called
told me come to the studio, i wanna tell him– "nah"


that’s what he said to me
but that place we call heaven unfair to me, only 144 can go
seven billion people on planet earth today
is there something that i don’t know
i know to follow him rather following people
or follow vanity cause that means i’m following evil
guess i’m following evil, i should follow cathedral
blessings i need but live like i don’t need you


so in conclusion
we all seem to stumble, planning our own demise
forgetting the big picture and making it wallet size
so to what is important in my life, i apologize
i promise to stay faithful, focused and sanctified
we all get distracted, the question is
would you bounce back or bounce backwards?
would you not know how to act or take action?
it’s just a part of life and if your vision’s impaired, you probably lose it all tonight



h.o.c., h.o.c
all the real smokers get me h.o.c
all the real smokers get me h.o.c
h.o.c., h.o.c
all the real smokers get me h.o.c
all the real smokers get me h.o.c


everybody know i spit that other shit
shit that make you duck for cover shit
shit that make you hop out your seat and slap your mother shit
especially when drop drop the beat
i drop jewels like my nuts dropped out of my briefs
jump in the booth and shatter every rapper's dream
they jump in a sauna because i killed their self-esteem
that's a jab, you should bob and weave
like pam when martin pulled jokes out his sleeve
i go in studio sessions and feel like a nerd
cause i'm the only nigga there not smoking no herb
you telling me the kush make you think on level four?
i'm on five, you saying that i can level more?
in high school, my teachers thought i was smoking stress
didn't know my eyes low cause of genetic defects
i stimulate my mind every time i think about the end of time
creation of man, and columbine


bet you think that this some high shit that i wrote
probably think i'm off the kush or the hydro
(nope) i don't even smoke, i don't even smoke
i don't even smoke, i don't even smoke
i really appreciate that you share your indo
but a sip of henny is the farthest i would go
i don't even smoke, i don't even smoke
i don't even smoke, i don't even smoke


look, nowadays everybody think they're big chiefers
just cause they heard that new tape from wiz khalifa
knowing damn well they can't hit the sour
they're new booties, they probably need baby powder
my skill shower over your city for 40 days
40 nights, off the chain, like freedom of slaves
before you get it twisted, like 40 gays
my flow worth the earth, that's not to be appraised
those the type of lines that i'm talking 'bout
you know the type of rhymes you don't talk about
copy my session on a disc when the session ends
so my momma can have it and play it for her friends
brag on me, like "my son's 'bout to win
somehow, someday, and i don't care when"
i might hit the gin once a month
i'll let you inhale, like an atheist


bet you think that this some high shit that i wrote
probably think i'm off the kush or the hydro
(nope) i don't even smoke, i don't even smoke
i don't even smoke, i don't even smoke
i really appreciate that you share your indo
but a sip of henny is the farthest i would go
i don't even smoke, i don't even smoke
i don't even smoke, i don't even smoke


i'll take you back to the 9th grade
when dough boy had me high for 4 days
that's my nigga, he a street nigga
probably in your hood, fucking up your street, nigga
but anyway i think it was some purple
told me "don't hit it hard because it'll hurt you"
i didn't listen, i was floating like the rose parade
swear to god a nigga seen some flying fishes
that was the vegas trip, hooters sponsored
the same time i start writing like a fucking monster
i'm frankenstein every time this mothafucker ponders
just underline every letter, capital k-d-o-t
laying it flat out, like a tire with slow leaks
now what you 'bout? nothing huh
am i a square cause i don't puff a square?
are my raps too blunt to hit the blunt? yeah


bet you think that this some high shit that i wrote
probably think i'm off the kush or the hydro
(nope) i don't even smoke, i don't even smoke
i don't even smoke, i don't even smoke
i really appreciate that you share your indo
but a sip of henny is the farthest i would go
i don't even smoke, i don't even smoke
i don't even smoke, i don't even smoke


h.o.c., h.o.c
all the real smokers give me h.o.c
(bitch i'm blowed!)

lord forgive me


kill him where he stand and stand over him
shake his hand, then jump back in that minivan
double back to his block and blam
i ain't backing down for nothing
i'ma back 'em down like shaq
with this black 2-2-3 in my hand
better pray that this chopper jam like a radio single, man
police radio signals saying that a 187 land on your corner
coroners comfort your momma
"momma, he's dead," the next morning
i toasted up with my homies
we drink and smoke marijuana
want us to change our ways? uh-huh
you see this game we play come from
uncles that raised me in compton
ask me what i have accomplished
i don't know, i don't have conscience
i just load up and start dumping on enemies
i'm headhuntin', no sympathy
ain't no love when you in these streets
just get something, protect your neck
'cause they coming for set, respect
split your onion, then chop your deck
your head tumbling like gymnastics (ooh...)
'cause ignorance is bliss


this the hardest shit you've heard from la this far
and i'm this far from a discharge, but never will i diss y'all
we all tryna ball, and when i got the rock, i'll dish off
until the day i pistol-whip you posers 'til y'all pissed off
then peel off in a hoopty
come back and make these niggas wanna shoot me


and they bitches wanna salute me or seduce me
indubitably, i'm too street—indubitably, i'ma do me
better than your bitch would, 'cause you niggas too weak
but just give me two weeks and i'm good
i'll make an album that'll put a smile on malcolm
make martin luther tell god i'm the future for heaven's talent
no tarot card reading; i'm foreseeing you niggas vanish
not only from the rap game—i'm including the planet
cats so watered-down, clowns can sink titanic
tie titanium around they neck and watch 'em panic
give me respect, dammit, or get damaged
die young, corpse identified by your parents
apparently, you a parrot, mocking me and my blueprint
but i won't share it, just make you cop it, then call you a sheriff
stop it, i'm hearin' the comments
the critics are calling me conscious
but truthfully, every shooter be calling me compton
so truthfully, only calling me kweli and common?
proves... that ignorance is bliss


and this still the hardest shit you've heard from la this far
and i'm this far, from a discharge, but never will i diss y'all
this my world, i grab the universe then play kickball
and they wonder why these california earthquakes hittin' so hard


i'm so-cal, you so-called rappers need to go call ghostbusters
'cause you busters are casper when i go off
i show up to show out and show off
you a hundred percent behind me
and if you are, then wreck your car
then walk up to my crime scene
i remember bein' seventeen, wishin' someone would sign me
now the only way these labels get me back is when they rewind me
backin' down bargains, backin' down bitches
we gon' flip her
once she off that blue dolphin, you gon' tip her
'cause ignorance is bliss


and willie b, i'm a fool on your beats
i bleed out the speaker as the speaker that spoke when they didn't speak

i can tell you what it is, i can tell you what it isn't
no more k. dot, my mother had named me kendrick
fuck a stage name, that's the name that i was given
the only thing that i can identify within this business
i'm just a good kid from compton that want to rap
weighing my options, pick up a bible or a strap?
i never killed a man, never sold any crack
all i ever did was try to keep my city on the map
but this monkey on my back, y'all don't want me to win
i'm tryna follow dreams, you want me to follow trends
so just to get a dollar, will i sell my soul?
i look the devil in the eye and tell him, "hell no"
they say anything worth having is worth the wait
well, i want the world, tell me how long that takes
there's no time like now, i can cut my patience short
or give 'em some more gowns, i don't even want the crown
i just want a peace of mind, and nigga, when i get it
you won't get a piece of mine, won't you mind your own business?
a rich nigga buy anything you sell him
a broke nigga believe anything that you tell him
well i'm a broke nigga, but still i wouldn't listen to you
even if your hand was on a bible quote, nigga, pfttuh


see i was brought up different
whatever that my pops said, for sure i'd listen
you said you did dirt, but i can't dig it
it don't concern you if you wasn't born in it
oh-no-oh-oh
i swear we got to fast-forward, before time flies by
my new saying for '0-10 is, why lie?
and if you ain't trying to win, then why try?
now you can low-ball or give me high five
this is i nigga, look into my eye


nigga, i am kendrick... lamar
nigga, my name is kendrick... lamar
i said my name is kendrick... lamar
i changed the name cause i was tired of being like y'all
now finally i'm ready to tell the world who i are, pfttuh


and that used to be a hell of a task
now i'm ahead of my class, so go ahead and harass
my character like it don't carry a confidence
that can marry a halle berry or angelina with no cash
i'm bout to cash in my thoughts
give you a compass, then tell you get lost
what i'm bout to accomplish is something that you can't fathom
once the eves come, they quick to stare at him
hoping i don't take their bitch, but i'm on some other shit
when i'm done, i'm tryna run the government
these are big dreams, transition from a rapper to a human being
you can't 'school' a dean
i be tutoring artist-es, leave 'em with no audience
all cause they all a facade, my god
y'all be out partying, i be stealing your audience
all because who i are, lamar


but my first name, it gotta be kendrick... lamar
nigga, my name is kendrick... lamar
i changed the name cause i was tired of being like y'all
now finally i'm ready to tell the world who i are, now let's go


but we can't go... backwards

uh, shoutout to schoolboy q

stuck in the street where it's dark like harpo

although i’m in the land of milk and honey
nobody never gave me shit, when i got my first chain
all the niggas tried to take it from me
i had to fight back and shit
take it back and shit
and you rap niggas looking funny tryna talk back and shit
like he back that shit
acting like you real or something
nigga ain't popped no steel, ain't popped no collar
go pop some pills or something
you trying real hard to appeal to someone
i’m being myself, my bff is a bm-dub
with your bm in it and your stash box glove
and the medicine a doctor gave a nigga won't help
i’m at the limit where i be amazing myself
i bet i finish on a level with a black belt
i bet i hit it where every rapper get killed, like
bla bla bla bla where the knife at?
cut cut cut where your life at?
your careers over, he’s slumped over
and if i'm off beat know i’m un-sober
that's a new flow
pl-, plus q gave me some kush and some nuvo
new dough for the new year and i sumo on a rap peer
not a rapper, i’m a raptor
that's a t-rex in a v-neck for the rapture
i’m a factor and your facial
i will fracture to a fraction
no one-half and i hate math
pastor’s like eddie long, fucking maricon
took me mighty long to get here
nigga, fuck!

ugh, every time i’m in my city, i be acting like my shit don’t stink

we hurt people that love us, love people that hurt us
hurt people that love us, love people
i'm inspired, so get inspired


and so he said "why you gotta be so kind-hearted?
why you couldn't be a con artist? why you couldn't?
why you couldn't be mischievous or just a lil' devious
the moment that we first started?
why you never ask for nothing, just a lil' time?
why you let me use yours 'cause i don't got mines?
why you always lift me up, when i'm completely giving up
and when niggas holla, "what's up?" you give a dry response?
why you giving me your last knowing you ain't got it?
why you always buy me something when you going shopping?
why you tell me that you love me?
why you always thinking of me?
want my company rather than going club hopping?
why you treating my momma like she your momma too?
why you making promises that you'll forever do?
whatever just to make me happy, wanting us to have a family
these are exactly the reasons why i cheat on you" (sometimes)


we hurt people that love us, love people that hurt us
hurt people that love us, love people that hurt us
hurt people that love us, love people that hurt us
hurt people that love us, love people that hurt us


and so she said "why you gotta be so mean to me?
why you don't know what you mean to me?
why you always playing games? why i feel like you ashamed
out in public curse me out and make a scenery?
why you got other bitches rolling their eyes at me?
why text messages popping up saying, "hi, daddy"?
why you treat me like i'm nothing? why you always at a function?
i be wanting to go out but you don’t ever ask me
why you slip and say her name when we having sex?
why you always assuming that i still like my ex?
every time we get into it, i'm the one that's feeling stupid
you don't need me, you gon' leave me, that's ya favorite threat
why you never know how it feel to be lonely?
why i feel i'm the last option after ya homies?
why you always gotta know that i will never let you go
even though you get violent and put your hands on me?"
sometimes


we hurt people that love us, love people that
hurt people that love us, love people that hurt us
hurt people that love us, love people that hurt us
hurt people that love us, love people that hurt us



oh, what up ho? oh, what up?

pussy and patrón, that's some great advice
i'm going through something with life
but pussy and patrón make you feel alright
pussy and patrón make you feel alright
pussy and patrón, that's some great advice


welcome to my diary, stressing got me gray hairs
something to inspire me, rather than society's
woes, let me go, let me shine a lil' bit, love
i want diamonds, too: ronnie on player's club
i used to have a nine-to-five; fresh out of school—that was '05
that bitch was racist, got me fired; ever since then, i had no job
pushing in my momma van, stop for gas on rosecrans
trust me, these niggas rushed me for something my cousin prolly did
guilty by association: story of my life, nigga
you gon' make me flip and split your shit, judge give me life, nigga
pain since my grandma's death, uncle killed at louie's burgers
hold my tears, i tried my best; let it go, drench my pullover
cycles of a starving artist, tryna go beyond the margin— margin
maintaining my modest— modest as i dream
so while i go through all this— all this bullshit, what you call it
life itself, i know what helps, let me scroll through my blackberry
("hey, what's up, daddy?")


i'm going through something with life

pussy and patrón, that's some great advice

all i need in this lifetime: pussy and patrón
give me that, once you give me that, once again, it's on
bitch, i'm swagged up, hoes bopping when i'm off that screw
coming down clean, tell your baby momma, "what it do?"
where your friends at? i got long dick—what it is?
go'n' poke it out, situate your little positives
how i live? big shot, on my grind, already
i'ma lay it down like a carpenter when you let me


ugh, i wrote this song when dave drove home
and caught that flat in the mean t-flats
and it made me think if we could blink
to change locations where we at
we often get lost in the alcohol bottle
in attempt to ignore pain, problem, and sorrow
just for a minute, then back to the bullshit
your car note due, and you 'bout to get evicted
two drugs, surely, patrón, pussy, make it feel alright
but once it's empty and that bitch leave, then it's back to life
you can't run from it, gotta run to it, nigga
the antidote wouldn't last, and you knew it, nigga
but still, you proceed to dive deep, ask what's her zodiac sign


i'm going through something with life
but pussy and patrón make you feel alright
pussy and patrón make you feel alright
pussy and patrón, that's some great advice
i'm going through something with life
but pussy and patrón make you feel alright
pussy and patrón make you feel alright
pussy and patrón, that's some great advice


i'm going through something in life
but pussy and patrón make you feel alright

rare breed, kendrick lamar
breed up or speed up
breed up or speed up
breed up or speed up


this is for my niggas that be all blacked out
hit the streets a hundred deep, what rare breed about?
riding hard, bending corners, the girlies on us
leave a hater scarred, big dressers sit at the stop light
road glides and road kings deep in my hindsight
you do it right or don't do it at all
put that candy paint on it, ride them twenty-threes homie
custom seats, custom brakes, hit the streets and ball
centre of attention like bynum and gasolyou know that killer californication
when you feeling like you sitting on a ceiling, chasing
dreams, hoping this conglomerate can run the nation
it's abomination how we bomb yo' block
i'm talking big punch, k-dub, baby slip billy
bad azz, rare breed, we all we got
see 'em out, show 'em love, chunk the deuce, give it up
it's a lot of bike clubs but they not this hard, nope


pounding on the highway stretch
all blacked out, making sure we on deck
might catch us on them dressers or them road glides, yes
tell the world i'm a rare breed baby
breed up or speed up (don't stop, don't stop)
breed up or speed up (don't stop, don't stop)
breed up or speed up, i'm a rare breed baby


and it's like that to the death though
two-oh-point and seeing decimals, i ain't lying
pounding on the interstate in the state that shines
or we might be in a hood near you
around the globe baby, rare breed under control baby
them pipes loud, the movement entice crowds
we heat it up in the cold baby
it's three degrees out? then you should see me out
or see bout them kitty cats and how they go meow
ha-ha, we be the father of harley drivers, so don't bother
show you infants how to whip it, have a bye-bye
posers try to hang? then we hang 'em by the collar
silk, lannie, rare breed family
stunting hard like a black circus, voila
breed up or speed up, get ahead
so with that said, bye-bye


pounding on the highway stretch
all blacked out, making sure we on deck
might catch us on them dressers or them road glides, yes
tell the world i'm a rare breed baby
breed up or speed up (don't stop, don't stop)
breed up or speed up (don't stop, don't stop)
breed up or speed up, i'm a rare breed baby

pounding on the highway stretch
all blacked out, making sure we on deck
might catch us on them dressers or them road glides, yes
tell the world i'm a rare breed baby
breed up or speed up (don't stop, don't stop)
breed up or speed up (don't stop, don't stop)
breed up or speed up, i'm a rare breed baby


shouting out the one and only rare breed
now breed up!

this is me thinking at 4:43 am, june 6th


sometimes i wanna say fuck rapping, i need money now
like should i start trapping?
if what i write down don't collect this very moment
then i'm on it, no question
in the streets, my niggas is well connected, let's see
do i cop a pound of kush, promethazine or push some e?
oxycontin have me laying on soft cotton when i sleep?
this is deep as the abyss, i'm not just rhyming on the beat
i be in spots, chopping the rocks like flintstone feet
this is me, frustrated, battling my own evils
finna saddle up that work across ohio in a geo
or should i sell my music .zip to buy your zip
and hope one day it flourish to a kilo
track record of a hustler
rather records on the needle, making music
clocking fast bank like a shot from patrick ewing
my nigga, what you doing on these corners whipping?
"i thought you had a show?" well, my nigga, i guess i didn't
i'm tryna get this dough, and easy money sounds tempting
especially when your homies pushing v8 engines
twenty-two on twenty-sixes, range rovers rolling up
three-fifty for an ounce of fire, i hope i got enough
this industry calling my bluff, i need a new solution
curb-serving, or i might be in your store boosting
two-elevens with mac-11s like fuck hip-hop
don't wanna be pun, don't wanna be b.i.g., don't wanna be pac
just give me your funds, a.k.a. everything that you got
or everything getting shot, for nothing
leave you in shock, coughing up blood and mumbling
watch, the plans of a young man sponsor
moving grams like relocating your mom's momma
then expand to the hoover dam, water, sherm
contraband, they yearn for the butt-naked
fuck a verse, verses get let off in thirty minutes, six seconds
i disperse to the world of unruly, where i put the mic down
and pick up a sack and a toolie, if you knew me
you'll know i always had a passion for riddling, writing
but lately, i've been thinking 'bout taking chances to brighten
my future financially, so please don't be mad at me
i gotta do what i gotta do, no shit
so i tell my nigga, "front me, let me put it on the strip"
then give it back when i think about the consequence
shit...


r.o.t.c—right on time conscience

uh
a lil' compton nigga
just a lil' compton nigga
one time for my niggas
you know compton, nigga
just a lil' compton nigga, uh
uh, kendrick lamar, uh

yo, uh, back with a vengeance
back with my heart and i'm venting
back with another war pendant, salute me or shoot me
i never wore a kufi, ignore my religion
i believe there's one god, there's one love
and i believe if i fly, we all doves
i make a way for my people to see the light
brighter than yellow bones
me and my microphone could be one
until i see big, pac, see pun but this ain't eazy
i can't take a big l, my city needs me, i gotta win
the proof is in the pudding
and i been fucking with cosby since i was ten, you damn right
any means necessary, get the campaign right
very emotional i'm a gemini, i love hard and i fight harder, a born author
a born starter, in the game for real
and the games appeal to the struggling youth with no father
you can't learn if mistakes ain't made
you gotta pay your homage in order to get paid
you gotta pay attention in order to pay dues
and you ain't gettin' it, 'til you start payin' jews
lifestyles of the young and the broke
with my hand under oath, i recite these quotes
and if i ever lie then i die where i stand as a pest not a man but a roach and a rat
in order to see the front, i had to play the back
we played our position, we let y'all play y'all self, y'all made y'all decision
we pray while we prey on competition
to flip another page of corinthians
i see stars when i write these sentences
words crash cars when i write these sentences
open jail bars for my niggas' life sentences
free j-dove, kill all witnesses
y'all better hope 2012 really real, cause the way i feel i'ma make y'all suffer
and take y'all supper
i haven't ate in the last 22 summers and i'm 22 now it's about to go down
so en garde, my god we got these artists in awe
oh, i'm free
finally i can say i'm me
the kendrick lamar ep, classic ep
the question concerns
i dropped it and gave the whole world my germs
hope y'all infected
hope y'all ain't have no protection
still i'm progressing, room for improvement
make room for the groom married to his music
i was at the xxl just trying to excel
networking, meanwhile my stomach turning
wanted to be a part of it cater it to my audience
j. cole runnin' late
if he don't show up, think i can take his place
ladies start laughing
no pun intended i ain't being sarcastic
homie popped up with about twenty bags and
fresh out the plane i couldn't even complain
my nigga was on his hustle i introduced him my name
said i'll see him on the bubble in the future, my dude i salute ya
contributing the real shit
talk about it make the people talk about it
make the world see, for every mc that i see tryna stay afloat
tell 'em build a boat like noah
and take him to a place that i'm sure we all can blow up, boom
i ain't a star yet but i'm gettin' close to 'em
and if you see a whack artist do more than boo him
throw him off the banister, shoot him on camera
then kill his manager
then hang a banner up, that reads you can't proceed without bein' conceived by one album of the 90's
on rosecrans where you'll find me
and all my niggas is grimy
but i remain the good kid
tryna make a difference where i'm from, where you live
oh no we got to slow the city down
i told the homeboy pump his brakes
he said that he rather put the pump to his face
sawed off
torture, turn the saw off, its scorchin'
hot where i'm from, the newscasters don't come
another ratchet got dumped, in the trashcan i ain't done
a baby in there with it
she said postpartum did it
molested at eleven and she always reminiscing
when he was undressing said it'll only be a minute
that's why i i think i'm always kicking something with feeling
i should've been a dentist
i should've been a blizzard-cold
flash, pose, flash, pose, a critic paparazzi got me on my toes
i wanna jump on him like a tad-pole, tad-pole, ass-holes
tryna kill my dreams
not elevate
those are not my dreams, i'll be straight
with a little bit of passion
and a drive like an aston
motivation from nipsey or glasses, jay rock
mykestro , bad lucc, u-n-i
dom kennedy, murs and fashawn
lady g, willy b in time
i'ma blow like i'm mothafuckin' sniffing lines
go like i never seen a red light shine
flow to my heart, hit the flo' when i'm dying
heart of a lion, tell 'em get in line
and pass the baton, i won't pass it back i ain't good at dimes
if the bitch bad i could pass you a dime
haters better duck like i'm passing a pond
know i'm the king and i'm passing you pawns
pad on the hill that's a passion of mine
problem is i shine like two mics under heavy strobe lights
i'ma need two mics just to get my point across
i'ma get my joint across, country y'all gon' want me

"i’ll tell you what i don’t believe in, can i do that? all right, i don’t believe in laws, or the system by any means, whatsoever. i try not to obey them at anytime. that's what i believe in not believing in."
"so what keeps you alive?"
"four big bottles of water a day, two packs of marlboro reds. and, uh, i don’t - what keeps me alive, shit. music, i have to listen to music all day long. i'd say that keeps me going. i’m a pretty dark person, i’ve thought about ending it a million times. and i have to say that music keeps me here, by far, the main thing."
thank you


sitting in the studio thinking about which mood would go
right now, freestyle or write down, whatever
it still'll come up clever, i just need to free my thoughts
and lord knows that i know better, but i ain't perfect
i ain't seen too many churches or know them testament verses
you should either hear me now or go deaf
or end up dead, die trying and know death
might end up dead, swallow blood, swallow my breath
fuck a funeral, just make sure you pay my music respect, nigga
i mean that from the bottom of my heart
you see my art is all i have
and victory tastes sweet, even when the enemy can throw salt
still knock them out the park like a fucking tow car
let bygones be bygones, but where i'm from
we buy guns and more guns to give to the young
i'm living the life of a nigga trapped, nigga
inside the system all you envision is trap niggas
my uncle doing life inside prison; he wasn't wrapped too tight
he told me "rap about life, not rap niggas"
that's why i'm shaking my head when you rap-dissin'
my stomach start turning, my nerves get to twitching
i start evaluating, then my final intuition
is that you wishing a come up, would just come up
we used to beefing over turf, fuck beefing over a verse
niggas dying, motherfuck a double entendre
and this is comp-ton, lions in the land of the triumph
wrap-saran our defiance, ban our alliance
put burners in the hands of the black man
one hood with 20 four-fours like a cloned kobe bryant
you probably heard i wanna be heard and wonder who i am
you probably even listened to "faith," and think i know zion
but really i'm just caught in the loop, of understanding the truth
because it seem like it's always clashing with science
i got a big fear of flying
my future so bright i'd probably go blind before i blink twice
i ain't lying
i swear to god, half of y'all just don't know kendrick
the school of hard knocks, we was the first ones in attendance
you walking down the block, he got shot, you are no eye witness
you just mind your business
you just turn your head, kneel down and then tie your tennis
it's kind of scary, ain't it?
you can't act like no bitch, that only got tyler perry famous
just let me explain this, why you pick up that stainless?
'cause your pops wasn't anxious to see you and you hate it
so much you probably had your burner tucked at graduation
so if you see him on 'em bleachers then you kill him
facing 25 to life with a murder charge
your enemies was the prey and now you pray to god
i pray these bars get farther than compton
and if our record never break, i still won’t break my promise
i promise to keep it honest
secret society, all we ask is trust
and all we lack is communication like service sucks
the people scared of annihilation when kingdom come
and i'm like, "the kendrick lamar od in less than a month, all right?"
gotta keep it pushing
can't let the government tell me how my future looking
i'm on rosecrans and central trying to duck the central bookins'
if the fucking pigs get behind me then you know i'm bookin'
never will i surrender
i been a warrior when i came out my mom's placenta
in the gutter lane like i'm master splinter
how splendid, i guess my project had did it
got all these niggas approaching they mixtapes different
they said seven tracks, i said 15
called it an ep, they said i’m trippin'
but little did they know, i’m tryna' change the rules
that we’ve been confined to, so the corporate won’t make decisions
uppity bitches handling business
killing our dreams, stealing our vision
out in haiti, adolescents barely have a home
in la everybody think they fucking on
hop on twitter, perpetrate we doing big shit
who we hanging with and bragging about the iphone
i swear to god most of y'all cats just don’t know kendrick
you barely know yourself, so i guess most of y'all should be offended
ain’t doing this for my health, i’m tryna' purchase my momma dem' benzes
occupying my time with riches, justifying my time ambitions
just to coincide, just to go inside, plus we idolize why we living
look, the mastermind took the master's mind
just the perfect time, just to master mine
just to match the grind with precision
look, the mastermind took - (cough)
