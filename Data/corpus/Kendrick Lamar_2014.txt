and we'll be screamin' out no rules, no rules
feel the energy we go through, i told you
pump my fist like i'm supposed to, i showed you
my vision of the unsocial, it's so cool
look around me and you'll see the scene, who to blame?
see my generation has no shame, i play the game
how i see it this is inside the future, this is nothin' that you're used to
i refuse to play the victim, my religion is to move ya
out your power position, my army head-on collision
can't harm me out of my own skin, government need assistance
every time that i zone in, nothing is more convincin'
than tellin' you that i won't bend, break or fake partition
i can't, this is my life design, this is me taking mine's
this is what i live for, this is me takin' yours
this is more than c4, this is what happens when
we ready to build and destroy, i hope that you enjoy

i live my life a rebel, a vigilante, devils try to get at me
pedal through this underworld, undertakers won't catch me
system ain't no system for justice if you would ask me
i'll tell you everything is corrupted, don't you walk past me
with the condescended look i can tell you're pretendin'
like you my friends and you just a henchman, i feel relentless
i feel the tension in the air thick enough to cut through it
or cut you with it, i'm cut from a cloth that bred a nuisance
trespass on your property i am properly aimin' to go against ya democracy
this is me changing faces 'cause i can stand alone and die alone as long as i got pride
the victory of fight is all in my eyes
the night is young and i can see your demise, i'm waitin' for it
you can’t ignore it, you live dormant, i die enormous
big as the lies you tell i can tell that you feel defeated
the truth will set you free and to me that's the only reason, capisce?


before i commit suicide, lives will be taken
mmm, real hip-hop, west coast


before i commit suicide
before i commit suicide
suicide, it's a suicide
suicide, it's a suicide
suicide, it's a suicide
i got my mind on the murder and the murder on my mind


suicide, it's a suicide
suicide, it's a suicide
suicide, it's a suicide


(oh, you motherfuckers think i'm playing, huh? let me hop on my daddy kane shit, jump on my shit, 'naw mean?)


the suicide

parasites in my stomach keep me with a good feeling, y'all
gotta see how i’m chillin' once i park this luxury car
hopping out feeling big as mutombo
20 on pump six dirty marcellus called me dumbo
20 years ago, can't forget
now i can lend all my ear into how to stack these residuals
tenfold, the liberal concept of what men'll do
20 on 6, he didn't hear me
indigenous african only spoke zulu, my american tongue was leery
hopped out the gas station, a homeless man with 100 grand
who passed me just asked for 10 grand, stressing about dry land
blue skies, powder blue skies then crack open
piece of crack that he wanted, i knew he was smokin'
he begged and pleaded
asked me to feed him twice, i didn't believe it, told him beat it
contributed money just for his pipe, i couldn't see it
he said "my son, temptation is one thing that i defeated
listen to me, i want a single bill from you
nothing less, nothing more"
i told him i didn't have it then close my door
tell me how much how much a dollar costs?
and this a freestyle beginning
and if you know me you know k.dot tde winning
we are the champions, we disagree
you can't see it then you best believe
this the cypher, i need y'all to throw some words up


and you don't, and you don't, and you don't
and you don't, and you don't, and you don't
and you don't, and you don't, and you don't
and you don't, and you don't stop


they wanna know the question
k.dot, everybody stressin'
this is the message that i'm kickin' too wicked, straight from compton
if you come around my city you'll get stomped in
the neighborhood watts and long beach
boy, you out of reach
this is tde, ab-soul, jay rock
schoolboy q, we hot, you not
this a freestyle off the top of the dome
big boy city, you know my home
i'mma represent every time i come to the lab
if you wanna see me, homeboy, get the cab
cause you can't ride with me, you can't see the streets
you can't see us, it's tde
my homeboy dave gon' fly you straight in
sippin' on that juice and gin and that's a classic
coming straight from dre and snoop
if you want us please jump inside the group
because you don't deserve it if you don't not
this is straight hip hop, this is off the top
and when i rock you feel it
if it's us and then you hear it
please consider that the best agree
the top number one emcee




now when i flip it i flip the beat as my enemy
you thought it was taming me, on point like a widow's peak
deliver the bars that everyone agree
they say the number one emcee, best believe
i love the pianos and i love the flow
i love the snare drum, i love... oh, i can't cuss on radio
because if i do they just might let me go
i'm side to the best, i ride to the best
i represent the west, please don't try to test
because you will get disabled
from best of flows i know, you hate it
everybody wanna rock, but they can't
because they come from the street of rosecrans 


i said we don't stop, boy, we run hip hop
boy, we run rap, boy, this is top dawg
d-o-t, d-a-w-g, k-d-o-t, c-p-t
l-b-c west, w-a-t-t-s, jay rock, he don't play
niggas and guards, projects
what you want? we can collide anytime with the biceps
but this ain't no strong arm, buddy, this just a freestyle
off top of the brain, boy, you know i get wild
you know i'm so foul, you know i'm off of the top
you know this hip hop, you know i cropped
the roof from the birth of the earth
and i've been doing this since church
with the small slacks, with the soft suspender
if you rapping like that, homeboy, we suspend ya
we contenders, we on the top off the map
we on the top off the globe and yeah this real rap
from the bottom of the soil since adidas and run dmc
sprinting like cheetahs, we run this game and beat me
and 
tonight's the night i jump off my shit
deep cover on the incognito tip
and every time the words flip the emcees step, but i don't trip
i keep walking, keep pushing and put 'em in a coffin
you often looking for the best, i'm here
we talking, you looking for the stress, you there
keep walking, you looking for the west, right here
you stalking the flow, you often to know
i want y'all to know been doing this since the days of death row and ruthless
i've been ruthless, the coupe it been roofless
you spit, the words be toothless
but it get like that because you feel it
i got rikki on my side and she chillin'
big boy on my side and he willin'
they say that he writing my bars, forget it





ah, ah


loving you is complicated, loving you is complicated
loving you is complicated, loving you is complicated
loving you is complicated, loving you is complicated
loving you is complicated, loving you is complicated
loving you is complicated, loving you is complicated


i place blame on you still, place shame on you still
feel like you ain't shit, feel like you don't feel
confidence in yourself, breakin' on marble floors
watchin' anonymous strangers, tellin' me that i'm yours
but you ain't shit, i'm convinced your tolerance nothin' special
what can i blame you for? nigga, i can name several
situations, i'll start with your little sister bakin'
a baby inside, just a teenager, where your patience?
where was your antennas?
where was the influence you speak of?
you preached in front of 100,000 but never reached her
i fuckin' tell you, you fuckin' failure—you ain't no leader!
i never liked you, forever despise you—i don't need you!
the world don't need you, don't let them deceive you
numbers lie too, fuck your pride too, that's for dedication
thought money would change you
made you more complacent
i fuckin' hate you, i hope you embrace it
i swear—


loving you is complicated, loving you is complicated
loving you is complicated, loving you is complicated
loving you is complicated, loving you is complicated
loving you is complicated, loving you is complicated
loving you is complicated, loving you is complicated


lovin' you, lovin' you, not lovin' you, 100° proof
i can feel your vibe and recognize that you're ashamed of me
yes, i hate you, too


you the reason why mama and them leavin'
no, you ain't shit, you say you love them
i know you don't mean it
i know you're irresponsible, selfish, in denial, you can't help it
your trials and tribulations a burden, everyone felt it
everyone heard it, multiple shots, corners cryin' out
you was deserted, where was your antennas again?
where was your presence?
where was your support that you pretend?
you ain’t no brother, you ain’t no disciple
you ain’t no friend
a friend never leave compton for profit
or leave his best friend, little brother
you promised you’d watch him before they shot him
where was your antennas?
on the road, bottles and bitches
you facetimed him one time, that's unforgiven
you even facetimed instead of a hospital visit
guess you thought he would recover well
third surgery, they couldn't stop the bleeding for real
then he died, god himself will say, "you fuckin' failed"
you ain't try


now, baby, when i get you, get you, get you, get you
i'ma go hit the throttle with you
smoking, lokin', poking that doja 'til i'm idle with you
'cause i (want you)
now, baby, when i'm riding here, i'm riding dirty
registration is out of service
smoking, lokin', drinking that potion, you can see me swerving
'cause i (want you)
(i want you more than you know)


i remember you took me to the mall last week, baby
you looked me in my eyes about four, five times
'til i was hypnotized, then you clarified
that i (want you)
you said sherane ain't got nothing on lucy
i said, "you crazy?"
roses are red, violets are blue
but me and you both pushing up daisies if i (want you)


now, baby, when i get you, get you, get you, get you
i'ma go hit the throttle with you
smoking, lokin', poking that doja 'til i'm idle with you


you said to me
you said your name was lucy
i said, "where's ricardo?"
you said, "oh, no, not the show"
then you spit a little rap to me like this
when i turned twenty-six, i was like, "oh, shit"
you said to me
i remember what you said too, you said
"my name is lucy, kendrick
you introduced me, kendrick
usually i don’t do this
but i see you and me, kendrick
lucy give you no worries
lucy got million stories
about these rappers that i came after when they was boring
lucy gon' fill your pockets
lucy gon' move your mama out of compton
inside the gi-gantic mansion like i promised
lucy just want your trust and loyalty
avoiding me?
it's not so easy, i'm at these functions accordingly
kendrick, lucy don't slack a minute
lucy work harder
lucy gon' call you even when lucy know you love your father
i'm lucy
i loosely heard prayers on your first album, truly
lucy don't mind, 'cause at the end of the day you'll pursue me
lucy go get it, lucy not timid, lucy up front
lucy got paperwork on top of paperwork
i want you to know that lucy got you
all your life i watched you
and now you all grown up to sign this contract if that’s possible"


now, baby, when i get you, get you, get you, get you
i'ma go hit the throttle with you
smoking, lokin', poking that doja 'til i'm idle with you
'cause i (want you)
now, baby, when i'm riding here, i'm riding dirty
registration is out of service
smoking, lokin', drinking that potion, you can see me swerving
'cause i (want you)

see, i'm the man, tell 'em roger that
i got bitches shattering glasses trying to holla back
my pockets fat, if not they getting there
that's vip, nigga, you'll never get in there
see, i inspire conversation with dollar signs
you either talking money or just remain the mime
she got a fat ass with an amazing mind
that mean great brain
i swear to god every time i pop off that i pop a vein
now ain't that true love?
i tell her kill cupid and give my crew love
and you ain't getting it 'til you get in that jew love
i'm talking seinfeld, ben stiller, wall street, bank tellers
tell 'em you couldn't bury with two cups
papa need his courage or face eternal extortion
i harbor around the orbit on my darth vader
you'll see the light saber dropping jewels, marc jacobs
you know

yesterday my nigga had told me his brother died
a day before that his homeless uncle was cold outside
a week before he seen the cancer in his mother's eyes
two weeks before that, couldn't pay his rent cause he lost his job
a month before that he lost the custody of his daughter
six months before that her mother said she won't see her father
and this before he did a year when them charges brought up
i shook my head, turned around then found a $100


i don't know why you keep blessing me
i don't know why you keep blessing me
i don't know why you keep blessing me
i don't know why you keep blessing me
i don't know why i don't know why i don't know why


yesterday i invaded privacy of a home
the day before that my partner had fronted me a zone
a week before i had loaded bullets inside that chrome
two weeks before that i shot them bullets and he was gone
a month before that i cursed my mother then slammed the door
six months before that i hit my woman, she hit the floor
i stormed out then seen a black honda accord
them hollow tips missed me then hit that little boy






so today i laid in my bed, stared at the ceiling
closed my eyes then asked myself how i was feeling
i analyzed on how a saint can play the villain
is my life coincidental or just god willing
i came to grips, jumped up, and looked out the window
see my nigga had that same little boy that didn't know
bullets is nameless, i guess this is meant for
me to give them a $100 then trash my pistol


now i know why you keep blessing me
now i know why you keep blessing me
now i know why you keep blessing me
now i know why you keep blessing me
now i know why, now i know why, now i know why


so i can bless you
so i can bless you
so i can bless you



yeah, that's cool
thirty two shots in the clip of his thirty four's a little nigga with heart
frustrated with being broke while i was climbing the charts
penitentiary chancin' and dancin' with suicide


yeah
punch what's happening brother?
niggas be poppin' that shit to me like it's something new to me or something, i tell 'em bout
i tell a nigga quick, that shit just a rerun to me nigga

that's what they tell me every second around the clock
every time i clock in, rappers checking they watch
studio paid for, hours unlimited
assholes, how many mcs i knock off they payroll
how many god mcs i knock off they halo
hip-hop ain't dead, consumers changed up
rappers love to see gold like the end of a rainbow
i stay low like my socks under my ankles
play the back like a turtle shell, know well
that my team got me if i ever slack on my shit
so i fail, guess what? i don't even trip
just like that, crush your little battle raps, punchlines
i did that in 99' you think it's a gold mine
when you think of one, you think you hot but i think you done
like queens new york slang, look what the killer brung
machine guns to a fight, fucking right
pay your bills or i'm turning out your lights, good night
i shatter niggas dreams, thinking they the west coast kings
'till i drop like visine
tell a nigga quick it ain't always what it seems
like the stitching on swap meet jeans
i'm itching to scratch a whack rapper, gun clapper
snuff him like a rude capper, got a cool bladder, but i'm pissed off
at ya


the real is back
fuck the artificial, won't you let the realers rap
they scribble in they notebooks, me i state facts
safe estate, they know where the best be at
whenever i ask, (are you not entertained?)
body any nigga that wanna holla' my name
and what, no cuts, this is top dawg gang
what the fuck, everybody else, pull your panties up


nigga said he'd snatch my chain in the streets, what chain?
i barely wear jewelry, so i ever had one
you barely see it on me, and if i ever had a gun
you wouldn't know it's on me, so snatch it and then you done
i'm in the studio just sipping on parmesan
thinking about who could fuck with kenny and parlor sons
i live this shit, try stop me, you won't live to shit
probably catch four between your abdomen
next time you see me, don't ask me who i'm collabing with

sleeping on a reclined bed with a thin pillow
i'm with a white bitch, ass like a black widow

so when i die, you can say i balled for a long time
the 08' frankenstein, beast like sasquatch
feet size thirty-six, steppin on hip-hop cause that's my bitch
i write a rhyme, then she ride my dick
the girl is mine, i don't know that hoe that you with

so focused, like a sniper when he zoom in
what's your motives? i bet it's to go against
or like the gt get your bitch ass bit, all on these streets
i'm the all mighty k, compton
rep it 'till my very death day, let the reaper in his face
and recite every song from n.w.a
i pay homage for those great who paved the way
wait, back to the subject of who's and who doesn't
do what i do, bluffin' until i touch 'em
like a masseuse do, nothing compares to me
but the throne, so tell 'em bring the chair to me
i'm a red bullet, small nigga
