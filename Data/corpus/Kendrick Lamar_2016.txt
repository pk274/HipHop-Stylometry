kobe really retiring



two emcees, that's all we need

rocky, good kid, mad city (good kid, m.a.a.d. city)
i was there-ah
now i had to switch it up and get the braids

flow sicker than aids
i gotta get paid, i gotta get laid
i gotta come true, gotta be real
i gotta be proof, gotta be you
gotta be us and gotta be due


step up, emcee
if you want time right now
come right now
and shine! (x6)


hold up!
i gotta leave y'all with at least a few bars
it's not about the women, the money, stars, and cars
it's not about the clothes, the hoes
know who we are
it's all about the mentality
love making chords
your life makes you bruised and battered
but that don't matter
if you wanna know
fuck all that chitter-chatter
do your thing, let 'em sing
let the gun-boy reign
bite the sound, i just came and blazed
what's up!

tire marks, tire marks
finish line with the tire marks
when the relay starts i’m a runaway slave
ugh, walking on water and running on waves
god mc oh my god you gotta see
there’s never no i's in me
of an odyssey, i’m a block away
fire marshal's moving in
marshmallows inside my pen
sweet sixteens
got a sweet sixteen and they deadlier than sin
i’m so appalled
with the prototype with a godly protocol
you an amateur, they wanna pro to call
i damage ya on camera, in compton, in canada
i don’t care where ya are
just blink twice and i’m there where you are
like a shadow in the dark, you a paddle in the boat
in an ocean full of sharks bout to come up short
water in the pot, flow crack rock like bam bam nigga
have two grams nigga pay up or blam blam nigga
had a black camry, bumpin' dipset, killa cam nigga
i had been around niggas, killas, pimps
you ain’t been around shit but your momma and your bitch
shoved off the porch when i was like six
uncle bobby got the house raided back in 9-6
kick in the door
k9s all in the kitchen way before i even heard of mike vick
momma in the bathroom poppa at work
happened on sunday we shoulda went to church
look at my shirt, polo on it
it’s gon' sell if my logo on it
i fear no opponent
a demon come near and i might throw a spear at the omen
you looking at the 2010 romans
empire, hiiipower hp, in ya face like hd
and i spit like a hk
i’mma shot like a h3, h-u-b-c-i-t-y, a-b and y-g
problem and hootie nigga
tell the government come shoot me, nigga
cause i’m going out with a fist raised
and a fist full of money give it to a fifth grade
drink a fifth of hennessy and then take another fade
with a democratic politician from ca
they don’t wanna see a b-l-a-c-k
making some scratch like a hall of fame dj
give us some free j’s put us in pjs
now we in the county jail calling for a three-way
god-damn, y'all cold
mark of the beast wear your god damn bar-code
stuck in the street where it's dark like harpo
black man tell me where your god-damn heart go
although i’m in the land of milk and honey
nobody never gave me shit, when i got my first chain
all the niggas tried to take it from me
i had to fight back and shit
get it back and shit
and you rap niggas looking funny tryna talk back and shit
like he back that shit
acting like you real or something
nigga ain't popped no steel, ain't popped no collar
go pop some pills or something
you trying real hard to appeal to someone
i’m being myself, my bff is a bm-dub
with your bm in it and your stash box glove
and the medicine a doctor gave a nigga won't help
i’m at the limit where i be amazing myself
i bet i finish on a level with a black belt
i bet i hit it where every rapper get killed, like
bla bla bla bla where the knife at?
cut cut cut where your life at?
your careers over, he’s slumped over
and if i'm off beat know i’m un-sober
that's a new flow
pl-, plus q gave me some kush and some nuvo
new dough for the new year and i sumo on a rap peer
not a rapper, i’m a raptor
that's a t-rex in a v-neck for the rapture
i’m a factor and your facial
i will fracture to a fraction
no one-half and i hate math
pastor’s like eddie long, fucking maricon
took me mighty long to get here
nigga, fuck!

two tears in a bucket, i cry with you, agh!
but i could never lie with you
i could never afford not to afford
i could never put my plans to the side with you
i could never see a red light
like a deer with a headlight, i freeze up when i re-up
see, i barely have patience, and you're relating
only the moment to complete us
why you hate to work for it? went to work for it
see, a nine-to-five was so jive turkey
but when thanksgiving came, checks didn’t hurt me
you plead the fifth, i read the fifth amendment
we both criminals with bad intentions
they say time heals all, but if i can shortcut my success
corvettes by tomorrow, ugh!


why so sad? walking around with them blue faces
she said i’m down on my luck
and it’s something i gotta have, blue faces
i hit the bank today and tell 'em color me bad, blue faces
get that new money, and it’s breaking me down


my homegirl got a credit card scam
she got a scholarship to college but she don’t give a damn
intuition got a black woman wishin'
she saying this on the phone with the noodles in the pan
i know you, woman, i console you, woman
you feel like the universe owes you, woman
oh, the anticipation, hoping you could make it
women don't prosper chasin' education
but you're talented, and can't handle it
and your homegirls can't be your manager
365 times four, plus more
can't get it right, tell me, do you got the stamina?
but ain't no money like fast money
even today, i'm considered a crash dummy
a rapper chasing stardom, how can i fast forward?
my accolades better than all them


but why i'm so sad?
walking around with them blue faces
she said i’m down on my luck
and it’s something i gotta have, blue faces (faces)
i hit the bank today and tell 'em, color me bad, blue faces
get that new money, and it’s breaking me down, to the top


i love god, i love speed
i love drank, i love mead
i love oceans in the deep
i love women, i love me
i love god
ugh! but i’m scared of godspeeeeeeed
sometimes


i wrote this song
looking at a broke home, maybe (broke home, maybe)
you know the poverty-stricken
the little broke boy and babies (broke boy and babies)
somebody say "kendrick american, they sho’ is crazy"
and i said “why?”
then he looked me in the eye
and said "homie, you're messed up
you’re banking on good luck, you wishing for miracles
never been through 'ish, you’re crying hysterical
you settle for everything, complain about everything
ysay you sold crack, my world amphetamine
your projects ain’t it, i live in a hut
you're living to keep warm, i'm living to pay rent
i paid my way through, praying to allah
you played your way through, dealing with wi-fi
bull-'ishing yourself, you talking to strangers
same thing go for the ones you came with
we all came on the boat looking for hope
and all you can say is that you’re looking for dope, huh?
these days ain’t no compromise, ugh
your pain ain’t mines half the time, ugh
a brand new excuse ain’t nothing to me
see, i made my moves with shackled feet"


cape town, cape town
cape town, cape town
caaaaaaaaape town
cape town, cape town

q just bought a brand new mclaren
rock-a-lack about to buy the projects
moosa got his son dripping in gold
me, i'm about to let my hair down to hoes
ali 'bout to let his hair down to hoes
top billing, that’s a million a show
might blow the whole no-whammy on soul
might tell obama, "be more like punch"
sounwave got a grammy this year
mackwop, bet he do what he want
level two, level two, no, i’m not done
you ain’t gotta tell me that i’m the one
i could put a rapper on life support
guaranteed, something that none of you want
ten homies down and they all serving life
ward is like twenty-five hundred a month
what if i empty my bank out and stunt?
what if i empty my bank out and stunt?
you ain’t gotta tell me that i’m the one
you ain’t gotta tell me that i’m the one
you ain’t gotta tell me that i’m the one
you ain’t got, you ain’t got
