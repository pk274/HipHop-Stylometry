i'm the biggest hypocrite of 2015
when i finish this if you listenin' sure you will agree
been feeling this way since i was 16, came to my senses
you never liked us anyway, 
as we proceed
to give you what you need
trap our bodies but can't lock our minds
everybody just stop
(the bigger i shoot)


as we proceed
to give you what you need
lock our body, can't trap our mind


we gon' be alright

uh, and when i wake up
i recognize you're lookin' at me for the pay cut
but homicide be lookin' at you from the face down
what mac-11 even boom with the bass down
schemin', and let me tell you 'bout my life
painkillers only put me in the twilight
where pretty women and women, and it's the highlight
now tell my momma i love her but this what i like, lord knows
20 of 'em in my chevy, tell 'em all to come and get me
everything i know, karma comin' heavy
no preliminary hearings on my record
tell em' other gangsters silence for the record
tell the world i know it's too late
boys and girls, i think i gone cray
drown inside my vices all day
won't you please believe when i say


wouldn't you know
we been hurt, down before
when our pride was low
lookin' at the world, "where do we go?"
i'm at the preacher's door
they wanna kill us dead, at the preacher's door
we said give 'em some more
this one time, do it fo' sho
but we gon' be alright


we gon' be alright
we gon' be alright (hello)
we gon' be alright
do you hear me, do you feel me? we gon' be alright (p!)
we gon' be alright (hello)
we gon' be alright
we gon' be alright
do you hear me, do you feel me? we gon' be alright


what you want, you a house, you a car?
acres and a mule, a piano, a guitar?
anything, see my name is lucy, i'm your dog
you can live at the mall
i can see the evil, i can smell it, i know it's illegal
i don't think about it, i deposit every other zero
diggin' in my pocket, candy paint it on the regal
diggin' in my pocket, ain't a profit big enough to feed you
everyday my logic get another dollar just to keep you
in the presence of your chico... ah!
i don't talk about it, be about it, everyday i sequel
i don't talk about it, 'bout it, everyday i see
i don't talk about it, 'bout it, everyday i see
i don't talk about it, 'bout it, everyday i see
pet dog, pet dog, pet dog, my dog, that's all
pick back and chat, i trap the back for y'all
i rap, i'm black on track so rest assured
my rights, my wrongs; i write 'til i'm right with...
god


it's been a week already
feeling weak already
got me at peak, possibility of what could be
situation is heavy, i've got to prove
on february twenty sixth i lost my life too
it's like i'm here in a dark dream
nightmare, hear screams recorded
say that it sounds distorted but they know who it was
that was me yelling for help when he drowned in his blood
why didn't he defend himself? why couldn't he throw a punch?
and for our community do you know what this does?
add to a trail of hatred
twenty twelve was taped for the world to see
set us back another four-hundred years
this is modern day slavery
the reason why i'm by your house
you threw your briefcase all on the couch
i plan on creeping through your damn door and blowing out
every piece of your brain
'til your son jumps into your arms
cut off the engine then sped off in a wraith
i'm on the dash with my bible in the trunk
had the vodka on the top
how come i can long time
how come i could make it popular?
puff on what i want
how come i could make it popular?
puff on what i want
see i'm living with anxiety
giving up sobriety
cussing with his sister
and playing with society
justice ain't free
therefore justice ain't me
try and justify staying, obituary
why you wanna see a good man with a broken heart?
once upon a time, i go to church and talk to god
now i'm thinking to myself
hollow tips is all i got
now i'm drinking by myself
at the end of section park
caught you when you walk besides your house
you threw your briefcase all on the couch
i plan on creeping through your damn door and blowing out
every piece of your brain
'til your son jumps into your arms
the engine then sped off in a wraith
i said hiiipower, one time you see it
hiiipower, two times, you see it
hiiipower, two times, you see it
conversation for the entire nation this is bigger than us

tire marks, tire marks
finish line with the tire marks
when the relay starts i’m a runaway slave
ugh, walking on water and running on waves
god mc oh my god you gotta see
there’s never no i's in me
of an odyssey, i’m a block away
fire marshal's moving in
marshmallows inside my pen
sweet sixteens
got a sweet sixteen and they deadlier than sin
i’m so appalled
with the prototype with a godly protocol
you an amateur, they wanna pro to call
i damage ya on camera, in compton, in canada
i don’t care where ya are
just blink twice and i’m there where you are
like a shadow in the dark, you a paddle in the boat
in an ocean full of sharks bout to come up short
water in the pot, flow crack rock like bam bam nigga
have two grams nigga pay up or blam blam nigga
had a black camry, bumpin' dipset, killa cam nigga
i had been around niggas, killas, pimps
you ain’t been around shit but your momma and your bitch
shoved off the porch when i was like six
uncle bobby got the house raided back in 9-6
kick in the door
k9s all in the kitchen way before i even heard of mike vick
momma in the bathroom poppa at work
happened on sunday we shoulda went to church
look at my shirt, polo on it
it’s gon' sell if my logo on it
i fear no opponent
a demon come near and i might throw a spear at the omen
you looking at the 2010 romans
empire, hiiipower hp, in ya face like hd
and i spit like a hk
i’mma shot like a h3, h-u-b-c-i-t-y, a-b and y-g
problem and hootie nigga
tell the government come shoot me, nigga
cause i’m going out with a fist raised
and a fist full of money give it to a fifth grade
drink a fifth of hennessy and then take another fade
with a democratic politician from ca
they don’t wanna see a b-l-a-c-k
making some scratch like a hall of fame dj
give us some free j’s put us in pjs
now we in the county jail calling for a three-way
god-damn, y'all cold
mark of the beast wear your god damn bar-code
stuck in the street where it's dark like harpo
black man tell me where your god-damn heart go
although i’m in the land of milk and honey
nobody never gave me shit, when i got my first chain
all the niggas tried to take it from me
i had to fight back and shit
get it back and shit
and you rap niggas looking funny tryna talk back and shit
like he back that shit
acting like you real or something
nigga ain't popped no steel, ain't popped no collar
go pop some pills or something
you trying real hard to appeal to someone
i’m being myself, my bff is a bm-dub
with your bm in it and your stash box glove
and the medicine a doctor gave a nigga won't help
i’m at the limit where i be amazing myself
i bet i finish on a level with a black belt
i bet i hit it where every rapper get killed, like
bla bla bla bla where the knife at?
cut cut cut where your life at?
your careers over, he’s slumped over
and if i'm off beat know i’m un-sober
that's a new flow
pl-, plus q gave me some kush and some nuvo
new dough for the new year and i sumo on a rap peer
not a rapper, i’m a raptor
that's a t-rex in a v-neck for the rapture
i’m a factor and your facial
i will fracture to a fraction
no one-half and i hate math
pastor’s like eddie long, fucking maricon
took me mighty long to get here
nigga, fuck!

i seen it vividly, jogging my brain memory, life no—
i seen it vividly, jogging my brain memory
life no longer infinity, this was the final calling
no birds chirping or flying, no dogs barking
we all nervous and crying, moving in caution
in disbeliefs our belief's the reason for all this
the tallest building plummet, cracking, and crumbling
the ground is shaking, swallowing young woman
with a baby, daisies, and other flowers burning in destruction
the smell is disgusting, the heat is unbearable
preachers touching on boys, run for cover, the paranoid
rapists and murderers hurdle alleys
valleys and high places turn into dust
famous screaming in agony
atheists for suicide, planes falling out the sky
trains jumping off the track, mothers yelling "he's alive!"
backpedaling christians settling for forgiveness
evidence all around us the town is covered in fishes
ocean water dried out, fire burning more tides out
tabernacle and city capital turned inside out
public bathroom, college classroom's been deserted
another trumpet has sounded off and everyone heard it
(it's happening) no more running from world wars
(it's happening) no more discriminating the poor
(it's happening) no more bad bitches and real niggas
wishing for green and gold, the last taste of allure
i swore i seen it vividly
a moniker of war from heaven that play the symphony
thunder like number four, then i heard
"what have you did for me?"
i fell to my knees, pulled out my resume
that dated back to june 17th, 1987
my paperwork was like a receipt
i was valedictorian, i was fearful of judgment
but confident i had glory in all my past endeavors
close my eyes, pray to god that i live forever
dark skies, fire and brimstone, some of us sent home
some of us never did wrong but still went to hell
geez louise, i thought you said that i excel
i made to pimp a butterfly for you
told me to use my vocals to save mankind for you
say i didn't try for you, say i didn't ride for you
i tithed for you, i pushed the club to the side for you
who love you like i love you?
crucifix, tell me you can fix anytime i need
amistad, chain evidence in my diary
never would you lie to me
always camaraderie, i can see, our days been numbered
revelation greatest as we hearing the last trumpet
all man, child, woman, life completely went in reverse
i guess i'm running in place trying to make it to church


young nigga, act an ass
young nigga, act a fool
young nigga, get yo' cash
young nigga, do what it do
young nigga go, young nigga go
young nigga go, young nigga go
whatever makes all of you happy in this bitch
just take it all back before the light switch

pimp-pimp (hooray)
pimp-pimp (hooray)
(hooray)
pimp-pimp (hooray)
pimp-pimp


i'm sick and tired of being tired
can't pick a side, the gemini
prophesize if we live or not
promise momma not to fear nobody
seen black turn 'em burgundy
hundred of them, i know i'm greedy
stuck inside the belly of the beast
can you please pray for me?

(what's up, my nigga?)


cornrow kenny, he was born with a vision
all morning with the mixed dashboards, triple digits
parallel park like an alien came visit
slideshow for the night show, ten bitches
find hoes with a blindfold, king kendrick
(hello, billy)
so many plays, homie, i finesse
palisade views with some sex
i lost a lot of love for missionary
this the first time i confess
me and top is like a kobe and phil
a father figure fuck with him, you get killed
fuck with me and he will kill you himself
tde the mafia of the west
move in silence, yeah, we juggin’ like that
act of violence, yeah, we juggin’ like that
i did a lot of dumb shit in my past
lord forgive me, hoping i don't relapse
dave just bought a new 911
almost thought i’d seen another plane crash
q just bought a brand new mclaren
rock-a-lack about to buy the projects
moosa got his son dripping in gold
ali 'bout to let his hair down on hoes
me, i'm 'bout to let my hair down on hoes
top billin', that’s a million a show
might blow the whole no whammy on soul
might tell obama be more like punch
sounwave caught a grammy last year
mack wop, bet he do what he want
fuck you niggas, level two, i'm not done
2teez told me that i'm the one
i can put a rapper on life support
guarantee that's something none of you want
ten homies down and they all serving life
what is like twenty-five hundred a month?
what if i empty my bank out and stunt?
what if i certified all of these ones?
bitch, i get buck, i'm as real as they come
shit is amazing, i'm feeding my cravings
you know that you want me, come here now, lil' baby
i'm fuckin', i'm crazy
serving it like i belong in the basement
or live at the days inn
yan yan my relative, black cherry soda
pistol and poverty, come get to know us
(get top on the phone)


who doing the drums?
man put that nigga on the drums man
yep, all day, "mortal man" and "kunta"
alright, from the top

somebody said you bumped your head and bled the floor
jumped into a pit of flames and burned to coal
drowned inside the lake outside, away you flow
and that means the world to me
and that means the world to me
and that means the world to me
and that means the world to me
somebody said you bumped your head and bled the floor
jumped into a pit of flames and burned to coal
drowned inside the lake outside, away you flow
and this i know

i got 100 on my dash, got 200 in my drum
name in the grab bags, put my bible in the trunk
taaka vodka on the top of my binocular, i'm drunk
how come i can make them popular, pop em' when i want
see i'm livin' with anxiety, duckin' the sobriety
fuckin' up the system, i ain't fuckin' with society
justice ain't free, therefore justice ain't me
so i justify his name on obituary
why you wanna see a good man with a broken heart?
once upon a time i used to go to church and talk to god
now i'm thinkin' to myself, hollow tips is all i got
now i'm drinkin' by myself, at the intersection, parked
watch you when you walk inside your house
you threw your briefcase all on the couch
i plan on creeping through your fuckin' door and blowin' out
every piece of your brain until your son jump in your arms
cut on the engine, then sped off in the rain, i'm gone


he drove alone, with a bottle of his own grippin' the handle
lit off henny, i'm tryna dismantle
these wicked ways, i've engaged in such a gamble
'cause i could speak the truth and i know the world would unravel, wait
that's a bit ambitious maybe i'm trippin'
maybe i'm crazy, maybe i exist in a different dimension
not to mention when i close my eyes i see the distance
it's such a scary sight so i rarely go to sleep at night
i watch the sun rise then i watch the sun fall
studied the son of god and still don't recognize my flaws
i guess i'm lost, the cost of being successful is equal to being neglectful
i pray my experience helps you
as for me i'm tryna sort it out
searching for loopholes in my bruised soul
but who knows?
i just need a little space to breathe
i know perception is key, so i am king


the other side has never mortified my mortal mind
the borderline between insanity is father time
i fall behind my skeleton, they tell me that i'm blind
i know that i'm intelligent, my confidence just died
carpe diem, seize the day, i can't compromise
a tapeworm couldn't cure this gluttonous appetite
a couple trinkets, they seein' me as i pacify
but couldn't fathom the meaning of seein' sacrifice
i'm passin' lives on the daily, maybe i'm losing faith
genocism and capitalism just made me hate
correctionals and these private prisons gave me a date
professional dream killers reason why i'm awake
i'm sleepwalkin', i'm street stalkin', i'm outta place
reinforcing this heat barking, these are the brakes
before i blink, do i see me before them pearly gates?
or this is just a mirage or a facade
wait

these metamorphic supernatural forces dominate what i see
a gemini, duality personalities always conflicted me


oh! but don't be scared of me, girl
i can explain
i know it's foreign to you
i know it's hard to believe
god give me the favor
let me explain
more than a compliment
and i could use some assistance, let me show you how
i can explain
oh shando! i spin around two times
i'll be there with the answer
let me explain


my mama told me that i was different the moment i was invented
estranged baby, no i'm not ashamed
i recommend every inch of your lunatic ways
praise the lord, you teach the kids how to be themself and plenty more
you know the male species can be redundant
i mean we love a woman and think we can satisfy her
between sheets, covers and pillows
i'm promising your lack of tolerance stuck on a zero
i'm promising that i'm acknowledging you as my hero
cause you believe in me
no you're not easily impressed
but i possess qualities that you need to see
look at my flaws, look at my flaws
look at my imperfections in awe
look how you unique that my mystique is a round of applause
and yours equally valued
you stick out like an alien compared to those around you
and that's alright because i like it
you and me are the same
hopefully i'm invited, hopefully you don't change
because i know for sure who you are


i can explain
your mama raised you, your daddy raised you
hand-washing your clothes on sunday
let me explain
walking your brother to school, three miles away
to feed the mind and soul
i can explain
don't you explain that, don't you explain the reason why your mind, it travels
let me explain
i wanna know what you think
i wanna pick your brain when i see you
but don't you ever
let me explain
oh shando! i spin around two times
a blessing in disguise
i can explain
i know for sure who you are
you're the goddess of the odd
i am yours
i can explain


i am yours
i am yours
i am yours
i am yours
ndiseza ndingene laduma vumile
ndiseza ndingene laduma vumile

but i could never lie with you
i could never afford not to afford
i could never put my plans to the side with you
i could never see a red light
like a deer with a headlight
i freeze up when i re-up
see i barely have patience
and you're relating
only the moment to complete us
why you hate to work for it?
the reason i never went to work for it
see a nine to five was so jive turkey
but when thanksgiving came that check didn’t hurt me
you plead the fifth
i read the fifth amendment
we both criminals with bad intentions
they say time heals all
but if i can shortcut
my success, corvettes by tomorrow
wait a minute!


now, why you so sad?
walking around with them blue faces
she said i’m down on my luck
and it’s something i gotta have
blue faces
i hit the bank today and told them color me bad
blue faces
get that new money, and it’s breaking me down honey


my home girl got a credit card scam
she got a scholarship to college but she don’t give a damn
intuition got a broke bitch wishin'
she tell me this on the phone with the noodles in the pan
i know you, woman, i console you, woman
you feel like the universe owes you, woman
oh the anticipation, of hoping you could make it
bitches don't prosper chasing education
but you're talented, and can't handle it
and your homegirls can't be your manager
365 times four, plus more
if you can't get it right, tell me, do you got the stamina?
but shit, ain't no money like fast money
even today i'm considered a crash dummy
a rapper chasing stardom, how can i fast forward?
my accolades better than all them


why you so sad?
walking around with them blue faces
she said i’m down on my luck
and it’s something i gotta have
blue faces
i hit the bank today and told them color me bad
blue faces
get that new money, and it’s breaking me down honey


i wrote this song looking at a broke home baby (broke home baby)
you know the poverty stricken the little broke born babies (broke born babies)
somebody yell "kendrick american, they sho’ is crazy"
and i said “why?”
then he looked me in the eye, and said "nigga you fucked up"
you’re banking on good luck, you wishing for miracles
you never been through shit, you’re crying hysterical
you settle for everything, complain about everything
you say you sold crack, my world amphetamine
your projects ain’t shit, i live in a hut bitch
i'm living to keep warm, you living to pay rent
i prayed my way through by waiting on allah
you played your way through, by living in sci-fi
bullshitting yourself, you talking to strangers
same thing goes for the ones you came with
when y'all came on the boat looking for hope
and all you can say is that you’re looking for dope
these days ain’t no compromise
and your pain ain’t mines half the time
a brand new excuse ain’t shit to me
bitch, i made my moves, with shackled feet
cape town


in today's day and age we practice the self pity of taking the easy way out
you wait on them, him and her
but when a blessing takes too long, that's when you go wrong
you selfish motherfucker


why so sad?
walking around with them blue faces
she said i’m down on my luck
and it’s something i gotta have
blue faces
i hit the bank today and told them color me bad
blue faces
get that new money, and it’s breaking me down honey

pimp pimp (hooray!)

two tears in a bucket, i cry with you, agh!
but i could never lie with you
i could never afford not to afford
i could never put my plans to the side with you
i could never see a red light
like a deer with a headlight, i freeze up when i re-up
see, i barely have patience, and you're relating
only the moment to complete us
why you hate to work for it? went to work for it
see, a nine-to-five was so jive turkey
but when thanksgiving came, checks didn’t hurt me
you plead the fifth, i read the fifth amendment
we both criminals with bad intentions
they say time heals all, but if i can shortcut my success
corvettes by tomorrow, ugh!

i love god, i love speed

i love oceans in the deep
i love women, i love me
i love god
ugh! but i’m scared of godspeeeeeeed
sometimes


i wrote this song
looking at a broke home, maybe (broke home, maybe)
you know the poverty-stricken
the little broke boy and babies (broke boy and babies)
somebody say "kendrick american, they sho’ is crazy"
and i said “why?”
then he looked me in the eye
and said "homie, you're messed up
you’re banking on good luck, you wishing for miracles
never been through 'ish, you’re crying hysterical
you settle for everything, complain about everything
ysay you sold crack, my world amphetamine
your projects ain’t it, i live in a hut
you're living to keep warm, i'm living to pay rent
i paid my way through, praying to allah
you played your way through, dealing with wi-fi
bull-'ishing yourself, you talking to strangers
same thing go for the ones you came with
we all came on the boat looking for hope
and all you can say is that you’re looking for dope, huh?
these days ain’t no compromise, ugh
your pain ain’t mines half the time, ugh
a brand new excuse ain’t nothing to me
see, i made my moves with shackled feet"


cape town, cape town
cape town, cape town
caaaaaaaaape town
cape town, cape town
ugh!

cornrow kenny
all morning with the mixed dashboards triple digits, skrrt!
morning with the mixed dashboards triple digits, skrrt-skrrt!
cornrow kenny
so many plays on me, i finesse
palisade views with some sex
i lost a lot of love for missionary
this the first time i react
me and top is like a kobe-and-phil
a father figure; play with him, you get killed
play with me and he-a kill you himself
tde the mafia of the west
move in silence, yeah, we juugin’ like that
act of violence, yeah, we juugin’ like that
i did a lot of dumb things in my past
lord forgive me, hoping i don't relapse
dave just bought a new 9-11
almost thought i’d seen another plane crash
q just bought a brand new mclaren
rock-a-lack about to buy the projects
moosa got his son dripping in gold
me, i'm about to let my hair down to hoes
ali 'bout to let his hair down to hoes
top billing, that’s a million a show
might blow the whole no-whammy on soul
might tell obama, "be more like punch"
sounwave got a grammy this year
mackwop, bet he do what he want
level two, level two, no, i’m not done
you ain’t gotta tell me that i’m the one
i could put a rapper on life support
guaranteed, something that none of you want
ten homies down and they all serving life
ward is like twenty-five hundred a month
what if i empty my bank out and stunt?
what if i empty my bank out and stunt?
you ain’t gotta tell me that i’m the one
you ain’t gotta tell me that i’m the one
you ain’t gotta tell me that i’m the one
you ain’t got, you ain’t got
you ain’t got, you ain’t got
tell me that, tell me that that i'm the one
you ain’t got, you ain’t got, you ain’t got
you ain’t got tell me that, what! i’m the one
yes, i’m the one!

it's been a week already, feeling weak already
got me at peak, possibility of what could be
situation is heavy, i've got to prove
on february 26th i lost my life too
it's like i'm here in a dark dream
nightmare, hear screams recorded
say that it sounds distorted but they know who it was
that was me yelling for help when he drowned in his blood
why didn't he defend himself? why couldn't he throw a punch?
and for our community do you know what this does?
add to a trail of hatred
2012 was taped for the world to see
set us back another 400 years
this is modern day slavery
the reason why i'm by your house
you threw your briefcase all on the couch
i plan on creeping through your damn door and blowing out
every piece of your brain
'til your son jumped in your arm
cut off the engine then sped off in the rain
i'm on the dash with my bible in the trunk
had the vodka on the top
how come i can long time
how come i could make it popular?
puff on what i want
how come i could make it popular?
puff on what i want
see i'm living with anxiety
giving up sobriety
cussing with his sister
and playing with society
justice ain't free
therefore justice ain't me
try and justify staying, obituary
why you wanna see a good man with a broken heart?
once upon a time, i go to church and talk to god
now i'm thinking to myself
hollow tips is all i got
now i'm drinking by myself
at the end of section park
caught you when you walk besides your house
you threw your briefcase all on the couch
i plan on creeping through your damn door and blowing out
every piece of your brain
'til your spine drip to your arm
cut off the engine then sped off in a wraith
i said hiiipower, one time you see it
hiiipower, two times, you see it
hiiipower, two times you see it
conversation for the entire nation this is bigger than us

two tears in the bucket i cry with you
but i could never lie with you
i could never afford not to afford
i could never put my plans to the side with you
i could never see a red light
like a deer with the headlight
i freeze up when i re-up
see i barely had patience
and you're relating
only the moment to complete us
why you hate to work for it?
went to work for it
see a nine to five was so jive turkey
but when thanksgiving came, checks didn’t hurt me
