said it's all on me

{verse 1: kontages]
wake up crack of dawn
last failure got me numb
keep diggin' at the crumbs
like i'm back at square one
satisfaction never comes
cause i'm never really done
these meals skippin' em'
cause i haven't really won
obie told me homie
all these rappers really lunch
i just gotta keep it movin' keep on zoomin' to the punch
if you knew me then you know what i've become
feel like i'm holdin' tons
way to heavy for some

{chorus: kontages]
yeah yeah yeah
it's all on me
swear that it seems the world so heavy
tryin' to get there
but they scared
they ain't tryin' to share
yeah i swear

that it's all on me


yeah it's all on me
yeah it's all on me
yeah it's all on me
i ain't tryin to go break the peace
but it seems it's too quiet in the streets
yeah it's all on me
