mo'fuckers poppin at me
baby mama say i can't, be the pappy
all this propaganda with my family
everything i got wasn't handed me
had to hit the block so gradually became the man i be (be,be)
sorry that my pop wasn't a man to me
had to opt for different boyfriends my mammy handed me
performing mammograms on her while i play atari
scarred me, horribly, horribly (sips drink)
lock that thought out, but at times i lose perspective
no disrespect but i was forced to think reckless
in and out of courts for using illegal methods
guess them poor choices left us disconnected
the one who points the finger got four from pointing back
nothing can come between us i'm hoping you knowing that
and if i let you down can't keep holding it on my back
i've got to stay focused where my sanity's at, sanity's at


dodging all these darts in my thougts i sink
can't let these people spill my drink
i'mma mob like a boss til i'm off in my casket is reached
won't let these niggas spill my drink
i'm riding through the city sipping henny with my thoughts in sync
can't let these niggas spill my drink
to my niggas gettin money, still hungry, try to stay on your feet
don't let these niggas spill your drink (drink,drink)


everybody lookin at me
like the boy lookin scraggly
since he ain't with shady
like everything collapsed behind me
my contract don't define me
it just reminds me
that i'm giving up my paper to who signed me
and with the dismay of my record release delay i
see who was close and how they slipped away now
price you paid when you ball and get on your a.i
crossover was cold now o's under the radar
so everything i cherished gotta be re-established
all cuz the marriage didn't succeed, it perished
the characters i used to feed all vanished
left me on my knees, bleeding with no bandages
no gauze when i fall
but even through it all i handle this way to ball mechanics is
kept at a hundred them other niggas is ametueres
guess that's the law of the averages-eww


dodging all these darts in my thougts i sink
can't let these people spill my drink
i'mma mob like a boss til i'm off in my casket is reached
won't let these niggas spill my drink
i'm riding through the city sipping henny with my thoughts in sync
can't let these niggas spill my drink
to my niggas gettin money, still hungry, try to stay on your feet
don't let these niggas spill your drink (drink,drink)


so even when your dreaming and them, intervening demons
get to, workin on your inner being
let 'em know you seem 'em
when the g that's within in got ya infrared scheming
keep me in your head instead you don't need to bleed him
cuz a boat with no anchor is a boat that's gon sail
you don't even need them folk, all's well
may they all burn in hell
cuz when all else fails
you the truth your blue glass won't spill


dodging all these darts in my thougts i sink
can't let these people spill my drink
i'mma mob like a boss til i'm off in my casket is reached
won't let these niggas spill my drink
i'm riding through the city sipping henny with my thoughts in sync
can't let these niggas spill my drink
to my niggas gettin money, still hungry, try to stay on your feet
don't let these niggas spill your drink (drink,drink)
