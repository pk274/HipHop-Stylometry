obie trice, nigga! stat quo! welcome to shady my nigga!
congratulations, another nigga out the hood!
i'll vouch for ya, lets go, nigga!


my name is o and to the b-i-e
trife life, entety
envy me, injuries
niggas who pretend to be
gangs-tah, nigga you's a fake-ah
gettin' money maj-ah, nigga you can hate if it's ya nate-ch-ah (nature)
never stop gettin' paper though
all that 'cho, just waitin' on a ho
gotta raise cocoa, put her in grade-a schools where asians go
amazing, two years retro, and in a vacant home where the aafes sold
now a nigga's on the road, sellin' out major shows, hate me hoes
never would have fathomed that
big lipped nigga from school craft
have access to the masses
now they sweatin' them backstage passes
try to give a nigga ass, cause i roll with a gangsa style
where was you at when i was on the ave, tryin' to get cash up/ (biatch!)


obie keep a couple hoes, tokin' on that okie-do
dick up in they ass so them hoes know they gotta smoke
they know o, ain't for jokes, thats fo' sho
so they try to hold on, as long as possible like a rodeo
i mean that that dick do so much damage
that obie's not that average, so you gotta pardon me, i'm so savage
gotta lot of bitches wantin' marriage
what bitch who? horse in a carriage
no bitch thats not obie's status
gotta know my apparatus
pimp, no food stamps, no pampers, no lips
strictly prophalactics inside these oversized mag-anums
when i'm dickin' down these actresses then
cut'em like john singleton, in a matress askin' him when they seein' him again


liven up to get'em
