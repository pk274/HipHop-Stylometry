niggas, when i step up in a bar (uh huh), faggots wanna look (what?)
like you motherfuckers got obie trice shook
like i'mma stand here as a man and
let some queer-ass, funny-looking nigga get the upper hand (hahaha)
i got issues, got no time
got guns that mourn niggas' moms (what else?)
shoot up clubs and destroy niggas' vibes (come on!)
everybody running for their motherfucking lives (ahh!)
tough club niggas, we leave early, cock back surely
open up your fade your gray brain meets motor city pave'
your nervous system still twitch off jay-z
o is an animal, skirts get murked
don't ever let a nigga tell you slugs don't hurt
don't ever let a nigga tell you to play the bar hard
trust in god 'cause you's about to get catch a bullet scar
i give a fuck where you from, who you be with
keep this a secret right by the nuts
a 4-5 that'll light niggas up
and this 4-5 high make me not give a fuck
