with ca$his, capitalizin on this mic in fact
we fuckin with the captain of rap
my nigga with the nike cap keep the continuity quite exact
so allure your cats into the second classic
we're mature as the number uno aspect, as yet
who'll surpass the drive of o trice?
the flow to die fo' and the death blow survive (woo!)
i echo through your external vibe
with internal experiences i've acquired (uhh)
i'm probably the most honest hip-hopper alive
a victim depictin images from my own eyes (yeah!)
never livin through homes, why?
homie got his own set of cajones, stand up guy
it's ca$his, o. tri', rappers we blow by
this is as accurate as the masses will have it, no lie
nigga!


we run this shit, fo'-five on the hip
been ridin for shady (shady, shady)
y'all niggas ain't dope, y'all niggas ain't skill
y'all niggas ain't crazy (crazy)
bring it on if you want, you don't know
the homicides that i got lately (nigga!)
we run this shit, fo'-five on the hip
been ridin for shady (shady)
