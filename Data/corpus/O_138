damn!
barshots the mixtape
obie trice
write you niggas a movie
yall niggas don't wanna be in the streets, nigga, yall niggas ain't prepared, man, this shit is for real, homie


shit's so hard you could be slain
now, look what a nigga became (bang)
and streets ain't nothin' for playin'
niggas best be holdin' them thangs
invest in somethin' that's sprayin'
unless you wanna be with half a brain
i'm just sayin' you better think when you're out here sellin' a cane


niggas get money, fuck the baddest honeys
then become missin' for a good one-month-y
find him in the trunk, dumped up from that pumpy
a bitch smelled a stench, nigga shitted his undies
said it would become me, death, he took funny
weapon never kept 'cause he felt his reps lowkey (whoo kid!)
they don't know these g's that barely run the streets
i pop bottles like twice a month, like every other week
decreet so that heat deceased them
he ain't keep a piece, he ain't 'bout that beefin'
he's about peace, on either streets, cheese them
didn't wanna believe them thiefs been peepin'
niggas be good guys, sellin' 'em pies, whats the reasons?
nigga, get a job or die
you might not kill us, but if you ain't the nigga that pull the trigger a nigga sicker gon' rigid (damn!)
