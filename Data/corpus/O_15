uh-oh second album out the stable
no worries about the paper, i ain't gettin' raped though
all about his payroll, bme is the label
hoppin' out the fly shit, we ainâ€™t carin' what they do

get up out your lane, just know it's about ta (bang)

we ain't worried 'bout money, we gettin' ours up
trice party of 40, we tear them bars up
when local broads after hours involves us
y'all can have 'em tomorrow dawg, we all love
the next city she wanna connect with me
correction: she wanna put stress on her neck simply
hit me on the text, meet right up at cha' exit
guess your girls get naked (bang)
you stretch things when dawg puttin' his thing on it
things keep comin' back, puttin' cream on it
it tastes good cause taste buds cling on it
the american dream: get money
see us comin', face just turned ugly
i don't let it bug me, you're still my lil buddy
steal if niggas turn ill,
