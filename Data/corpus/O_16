o-trice, back, at it
they don't wanna see him platinum
they just wanna see him brraaatted
they just wanna see him tec something kwame kilpatrick
get next to him
so they can be the first to rat it
savage, put him in a cascet
categorize him, say cheers was a classic
that's it, as if
he ain't bring the city to the masses
minus mathers, by my name is a asterisk
like the craft ain't shown them where the cash at
like my past, so i half step
like i ain't work the bag on the ave
i swear they ass backwards
let them put a nigga in the trash
o has fought, as you should
never mind a player hater, as long as you good
never change, gutter
so you can downplay my name, o still the same
come on


o-trice, back, at it
i ain't never came whack
all i ever gave's crack
all i ever gave's back
ain't a human being on this earth say opposite that
you can misconstrue what he do
cuz he cruise in an automobile or two
i know how to trap
i know how to double-up
been doubled-back
no matter the circus stands, see i emerge from that
used to serve the bundles, now the verse intact
used to worship onions, now i service rap
there's certain cats uncertain with that
rather see him serve his dirt nap
like i deserve them curses
like i don't speak in cursive
like i ain't got a purpose
beast of the streets
dope stay on o-trice's person


bme, obie trice, 2011, bottoms up
you know
some days you the dog, some days you the hydrant
gotta keep moving
