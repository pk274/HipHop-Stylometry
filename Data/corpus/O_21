semi on the couch, 3 bullets up in the cartridge
four runnin the house hopefully god can vouch for us
we outlaws
dropped out of school so momma trusting the lord with some ralph on
identity crisis when the trice's divorced
so the enemy's trifling like my pop, no remorse
i outsource
get the illest nigga on the block who will bust off a shot for him
find a little spot, some hood home
eighteen now, niggas getting they thug on
gotta get this paper niggas getting they drug on
haters see us caking know they gettin' they mug on
homie losing focus, he don't wanna traffic
he pullin' pistols out on nigga's up in traffic
jumpin' in they classics fucking with the maggots
got us looking hot, you know that end up being tragic
tell a boy stop, i ain't got the audacity
i just wanna cop, he furious passing me
know the streets watch but him nigga's is tagging me
say you see o? that's where the car jacker be
know i keep the mac on me
living out here carelessly
ended up burying i'm listening to the pastor preach
now i face his old earth askin' what it's worth
my sons in the dirt, my nigga got me in the church


thinking i'll fuck around catch 5
i'm up here in the church
reading psalm 4 through 5
homie got me in the church

mommy outta high school, voided her college scholarship
she want higher knowledge afford, that mean she gotta strip
round this bitch, taintin' her little purity
all she banking on is cartier's and some jewelry
winning at the poles, hoes, see her body tough
no ass shots, mommy just get pilates up
why they wanna body her, just for tryna make a buck
the devil done embodied her, now she don't give a fuck
ain't about college now it's about a dollar
she turnt up, hottest in the city, most popular
ballers want a shot at her, fly her out do shots with her
non-stop shopping for the number one ass dropper
but the devil got binoculars, homie got a wife he's stalking her through metropolis
tryna get the drop on her but, she ain't contacted joy from cheaters
she paid boys with them heaters
put her fucking cleavage beneath us
make her family grieve know the streets is devious
birth name eve, better known for her apple
them nigga's blew tree then filled her up with ammo
found her in the trunk she was missing for weeks
made her an example for nigga's to cheat
shorty was my peeps man may she rest in piece fam
obituary in here, let's take a seat
she got me in the church


thinking i'll fuck around catch 5
i'm up here in the church
reading psalm 4 through 5
she got me in the church
look in the box she ain't alive
she got me in the church
i'm in the church

we ain't in the pew less there's a body to view
old folks say niggas irresponsible
if he ain't at the alter meeting our father
most niggas say why bother
unless it's life altering, then we need bishop to visit
show us an see something different
lost so many friends it's religious
they in a penitentiary that's 72 inches beneath
believe in the creator but sunday's we gettin' paper
funny how money come up before nigga's save ya
some don't come up, sending out prayers
ain't trying to preach just speaking on our behavior
we ain't in the church less somebody close hurt
spirit leave the earth put his shell in the dirt
shells scattered all over the turf
first 48 investigation's a blur
how that look as a murderer up in the church
sitting next to the nigga mother i done murked
demons get to working, palms get to sweating and
heaven's looking far fetched fuck what the reverend say
me i'm just praying man that i keep a steady hand
when them devil's is ready to start spraying
take me off the lamb, rip my brand
so my fans and family can see me land
right up in the church


thinking i'll fuck around catch 5
i'm up here in the church
they reading psalm 1 through 5
nigga got me in the church
look in the box i ain't alive
i'm up here in the church
i'm in the church
