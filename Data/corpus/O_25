me, i ain't no rapper
nigga, i'm a trapper
eva since nigga was invented
came out that snapper
cocaine pin my stature
bring it back, whip kane ackerin
oh lord, so hard, just like a statchet
mathmatics, nigga, i'm stackin'
whateva you crab, i'm matchin'
i'm soap certain bout my curses
shit's comin' back to a mansion
at work call a nigga athen
i rap, still give a dabble
there's only curtains went over certain
i ain't dealin' with hustles
bring that bread back to that castle
lay it on the bed, that's what blacks do
take a picture, me and my figures
basket in my satchel
you rap, i'mma come back to put you beneath
nigga no altitude
my attitude is absolute
nigga like me comin' after you
