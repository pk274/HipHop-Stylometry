don't come down things will always work out
don't come down things will always work out
so when you find yourself in pieces


as a child i was foul
ma, i couldn't understand them things that came out your mouth
(daddies ain't shit)
you would fuss, cuss 'til your blood pressure was up
then give up and slouch on the couch and drink your liquor
("fuck you boy")
a hard-headed nigga i was, quick temper
short attention span not attending class
what a dummy, i would run over you honey
you confront me and say "obie you no longer have a mommy
don't use my phone, don't even eat my food
matter of fact, don't speak" and it was just me and you
in the house, with that mouse and them traps and that gat
waiting on the day for you to pull the trigger back

"you trying to kill me boy, that's what you wanna do kill me?"
ma you're not feeling me, the beef is not that drastic
"weed blasted bastard, you're lying (you're lying!)
you tuck plastic freezer bags with dope inside of em"
she knew, but she hated that it was true
"i done raised two boys, i can do away with you"
the locks changed, and the nights got colder
i'm slanging boulders, looking like a boulder toker
but fuck it, i'm the obster, i'm down for mines ma
she ride by my corner like, "i'm not gonna cry
i would not reap the pain of watching my youngest man
on the corner slanging 'cane, i'm calling the cops"

ma, even though i left the house wrong
seventeen years old on my own, using these streets as my home
there's no need to prolong this beef dear, i love you
ms. eleanor trice i place no one above you
you the reason when i hustle, i knew to stack
the reason when i opened up mics i knew to rip
the ethics you enstored in this hectic young brother
rubbed off after all, now look at your boy
when they ask about me now you won't just put your head down
straighten up ma, you can smile now proud
everything's kosher with the boasterest obster
let's get closer, so regrets never approach us


don't come down things will always work out
don't come down things will always work out

don't come down things will always work out
don't come down things will always work out
