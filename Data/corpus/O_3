(two by two) your bucket is clean, you ridin mean
pull up at the light on them spree's (gimme that!)
school craft wanna jingle your keys
whatchu 'bout to do? bleed!


(five by five) niggas connive, i thought you knew it
your main man's settin you up nigga you blew it
told him what you doin, nigga, you're ruined
you ain't knowin?


(eight by eight) you're carryin weight, hey, but wait
a lot of hungry niggas know where you stay
address your address, change your place
before you spray nigga


(eight by eight) you lay at your wake
you was played, slugs struck the escalade
your brain rest on what motor city paved
no more sunny days


(five by five) niggas be live before they die
'til the test the wrong animal then they spirit fly
just know the game while you playin the tough guy
that's yo' life


(two by two) trust no one when you're gettin them
put your life in perspective, you're killin 'em
envious niggas stay jealousy driven
niggas need to be listenin
