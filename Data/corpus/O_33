you got money
for you to come out, it's best
i pack a gat the size of a rat in south west
when i get low, i get dough
so it's nothin' for you to pass me and get broke
i been like this
since the lickle youth
stickin' cats for better major skittles, too
now or later's, jolly rangers and charlie juice
what can i say, dog, i had the sweetest tooth
in middle school, ain't shit changed but the vics
sock a nigga in his lips and take his kicks
shit, ain't this a bitch, they don't fit
fuck it, i sell 'em quick, to get the chips
at high school
things got hella proper
i stop hittin' cats and start hittin' their lockers
i got purses and wallets for my big pockets
bitch, shut the fuck up and give me the watches

kobe gotta eat, i be more go in the street
lookin' for victims, strapped with their heat
you wet the payphone
your scrap's goin' with me
tried to run, popped in the knee
i'm popular for poppin' up on niggas when my pocket's on e
pistol point, person and a purse
"just don't kill me, i got two children"
i can't front
i might snatch the shit that you probably don't want
run at two
my daughter kobe, she two
and i ain't got a job
so why would you ask me when i'm robbing you, fuck you
by all means nec'sy
get outta line while i'm stickin'
the shit right there get's messy
caliber heavy
ready to bust, nigga
run 'em jewels, or your dick's in the dust (motherfucker)
