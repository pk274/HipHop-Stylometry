since yayo is home, them ar's is drawn
obie's guerilla-unit, fuck affiliation
we are one, it is senseless for you to prevent this
the .40 cal'll put you up under some photosynthesis
at any given instant {gunshot}, another incident
you just got a glimpse of obie and yay's temperment
and we holdin' them k's, that's why homie won't age
isn't it that tony's enraged they throw him in cages?
but now my nigga's loose, our crews is bulletproof
all brought to you from whom's pupils' baby blues
his short fuses put your portrait on the news
nigga, them screws is loose
when you fuckin' with them shady dudes
