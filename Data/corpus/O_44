eleven, fourteen, seventy-seven a nigga entered
big lips, popped out placenta
mom ain't breast feed, had no pop neither
pop leaves shit but a name - obie
elementary, homie, that's how it started
in garbage, retarded, gainin that heart
fuck niggas, claimin they hard, a nigga come home touched
my motherfuckin momma bangin me harder
"nigga take your ass out there and fight them tomorrow"
that's what she told me, "little punk, blame that on your father"
so i had no choice, nigga, pick up a brick
split a motherfucker's shit for tryin to fuck with the kid
get a little older, hair on my dick, now i'm curious
niggas on the corner getting money, rockin jewelry
allowance, nigga, that ain't man shit
cowards, nigga, that ain't man shit
i had to prove to myself
how these niggas same age as me calculatin' this wealth
so i got me a clique and niggas what?
workin one sixteenth, like "nigga, we can clean up"

only my motherfuckin momma nigga holds me down
and lord knows all the shit that i done put her through
i speak through her, straight to you motherfuckers
follow my life, homie from start 'til now
only my motherfuckin momma nigga holds me down
and lord knows all the shit that i done put her through
i speak through her, straight to you motherfuckers
