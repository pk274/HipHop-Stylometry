you get more for your money
when you fuck with mr. porter

yeah
tweak my vocals just a lil bit
yeah
turn me up sound man just a lil bit


good morning good evening, good evening good morning
when y'all was yawning, i was performing
when y'all was snoring, obie was touring
couple of 
good morning good evening
good morning good evening
who they believe in, who they decieving
good morning good evening
good evening good morning


as kunta kinte wasn't sensei roots
that's why modern cocaine is o's truth
methamphetamine's make friends enemies
when we all tryna chase the same loot
remember bob had a noose
but as a kid rocks, pocket my triple fat goose
so who are you to point finger bout his demeanor
even though you thinking his demons could be cleaner
now we dream of goodfellas not mandela
we are the same colour his acts is so stellar
drug peddler believin' in what they tellin' us
hard young blacks on the map has no relevance
president's black that's evident
but crack bring precedence back dead presidents
pocket's full of opposite what my melon gets
elephant in the room y'all on some poaching shit


good morning good evening
good morning good evening
who they believe in, who they deceiving
good morning good evening
good evening good morning


landed on this bitch with columbus, true
with no compass understanding o's roots
reincarnated like cordoza i snoop
inspired by the essence of understanding my truth
understanding why i brandish a weapon at you
when he resemble i, and we are only few
why, animosity builds in to a fuel
when the ruger is spilled and kills another dude
they just watch the tube
screw us moolies like something in they food how they view us humans
morning and evening, evening and morning
we all over the news like we part owning
we far gone because we not knowing
we so far from home 
good morning good evening
good morning good evening
who they believe in, who they deceiving
good morning good evening
good evening good morning
