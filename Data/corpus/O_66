yeah
let's go, baby
obie trice, listen


they say he wouldn't make it
but that ain't old make-up
came from servin' fiends flavors
until i got 
cold nights
trice on the corner, rollin' white

in a holding cell after reading rights
they don't know what i received in life

by any means make it easier right?

something a beat does to obie
i'm from the street 
i'm home, but i was starving
i sold yayo now 
i'm up in the air, baby
you niggas just do whatever you wanna do
or say whatever you say about a nigga like me, but
i'm up in the sky
