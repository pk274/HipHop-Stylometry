i told you, don't fuck with me

when niggas go to the club, it's always
it's one knucklehead nigga always mean, muggin' and shit
heh, he wanna, he wanna have contact with me
have contact with men, all these bitches in here
faggot ass, these for them hard head niggas man


now i don't wanna come across as a boss some type of mafia
but these are my thoughts, they awful, i won't argue with ya
but see, i got a cause, a clause, that i live by
keep the heater close because i don't want to die
you see, i'm from detroit where they dump 'em off in coffins
and often there's assorted men where bullets holes departed him
and i don't want no parts of them, crazy complications
so i keep the heater cocked up in case of confrontation
and i would just be fakin' if i said i wouldn't erase him
if he blatantly tried to take away god's creation


i'll kill me a muthafucka
running up on me, may he rest in peace once released
i'll kill me a muthafucka
yeah, look at ya now, for runnin' ya mouth
ya stretched on the ground
i'll kill me a muthafucka

we can get it poppin'
i'll kill me a muthafucka

just to show these muthafuckas yes, i am a resident
i ain't stack up my pennies just to move out the city
so if you got a problem with me you should know where to get me
