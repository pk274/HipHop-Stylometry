ayo i'm focused, it's the locust
o. trice is holding the soldiers, the prognosis
probably why i rose from zero to hope
cause i was wide eyed and open nosed on my approach
nigga, hold the toast you provoke
44 snub hugs my scrotum when i roll
yes i hold my own, so if you think you deebo's clone
i'm aimin, watch i'm switchin to damon
and next friday i can bet you's a changed man
when them thangs in hand, it's not a game man
i ghost ya, i bring ya much closer to jehovah
definition of a soldier, i told ya
i, hold the toast when i approach
it's close at all times by my side in the holster
o-ster roast ya, make me blow my composure
pop, it's all over, when the 44 blows and goes a..


when i'm up in the club and these niggas, they wanna act tough
'til they get plugged, watch them bullets go...
now you touched from a slug, huggin the streets like you in love
your heart rate's like...
the ambulance arrive
they rush you to the 'spital, flyin by my ride, engine like...
homie you just died, your family through crying
i pulled off a crime, just as quick as...


you could lose your face, in a fool's race
i pulled my tool first nigga, you was in second place
and second place just means you didn't react with haste
and this differentiates life where murder being the case
and since murder was the case, it just means niggas erase
another black mother can't eat the food on her plate
cause she ain't got the taste as if raising you was a waste
"such a short span young man" said at your wake
first i'm a man, second i'm five eight
but size and weight won't give a nigga the upper hand
cause when i pop, i give this up like barry sand
sit in the can, he never ran like barry sand
obie ain't playin, obie got a plan
and the plan is not to be layin in earth's land
i will pop before decayin in earth's land
you get shot for playin me less than a man, mothafucka

niggas get it twisted, liquor make 'em envision
that gangsterism is disrespecting a niggas wishes
which is all that tough talk in front of bitches
yeah you fifteen deep, the desert e'll give ya stitches
and i can be all the bitches and hoes you wanna
but i warn ya the glock could make it hot as california
you be popped on the corner, flesh meeting in the coroner
o's in quarantine, cause no holes in me
an' since no holes in me, niggas take advantage
'til i manage to pull that hammer out, they start scattering
i'm no gangster, i'm a average man
but be damned if i let 'em do me savage man
before that i'm strapped and will challenge him
cock back and that gat will damage them
it's not a act, this is fact, this is how i'm programmed
this is me, what i'm about, this who i am, motherfucker
