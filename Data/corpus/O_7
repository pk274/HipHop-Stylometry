yeah, detroit native is back with some more flavor
commemorate the fact that he kept in y'all favor
never turned his back on rap than what he gave 'em
first solo act with a plaque and y'all saved him
y'all made him, only reason that he pacin'
late in the studio just to get it in the a.m
when chrisco say "let's go" it's time to slay them
police issue pistols is what's blazin'
we turn a song you sing to a murder scene
emergencies cut through your skinny jeans
obie's been many things, a bitch ain't one
you know it turn a nigga's stomach with the shit it's become
it could turn you to a hermit, hiatus is done
bottom's up, we'll confirm it when the new year come
and like, you ain't gotta dig it, the true get it
been through the bullshit, cruise, i move like mike vick wit' it
