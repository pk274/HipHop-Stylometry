here we go
yeah, yeah


you could get popped, it's a possibility up in my vicinity
poppin' off with that hostile energy
in a hospital with a doctor getting in
when adrenaline is mixed with an obnoxious temperament
honestly i got a monster pistol gripped
and i commence to spit, none of y'all exempt from it
spit, spit, passes from it
you get stiff from it, church man see your box plummet
and i will never let 'em give it to me
i gotta live to be one hundred and three
gotta reach my epitome
wanna seize my enemy
and receive my penalty nigga


lay down, lay down (oh yeah, oh yeah)
i'm a man, man
i ain't runnin', i'mma stand with my gun in my hand
i got plans and a place to be
lay down, lay down (oh yeah, oh yeah)
i'm a man, man
i ain't runnin', i'mma stand with my gun in my hand
i got plans and a place to be
lay down


ain't tryna be cocky with it
but i'm the nigga from the block that did it
got an honest livin', i ain't tryna see the box in prison
getting knocked outta my position
now i got a pot to piss in
pissed off motherfuckers' mouth off bitchin'
probably cause he lack ambition, so his wack decisions
get mad at the nigga that's getting 'em
that's when he see the next nigga that's hittin him
with a vigorous pistol over this ridiculous issue
dismiss you, in attempt to
take me out my motherfuckin' tempo, nigga


lay down, lay down (oh yeah, oh yeah)
i'm a man, man
i ain't runnin', i'mma stand with my gun in my hand
i got plans and a place to be
lay down, lay down (oh yeah, oh yeah)
i'm a man, man
i ain't runnin', i'mma stand with my gun in my hand
i got plans and a place to be


niggas get nauseated, a artist made it
had it hard against odds and emancipated
to the floor i spit, 'cause, goddamn they hate it
to see the lady they dated caterin' to the latest
shadiest artist, up in my radius
get faded with a plated revolver
rated me r, haters get faded with horror
erased, no fate for tomorrow
all 'cause he think he hard tough
got a car 'cause, he was runnin' at the mouth, hush
i will never let 'em give it to me
i gotta live to be one hundred and three
gotta reach my epitome, or decease my enemy
and receive my penalty, that'll be the end of he
tryna seize my entities, finna be the end of his identity
when i tell him to


lay down, lay down (oh yeah, oh yeah)
i'm a man, man
i ain't runnin', i'mma stand with my gun in my hand
i got plans and a place to be
lay down, lay down (oh yeah, oh yeah)
i'm a man, man
i ain't runnin', i'mma stand with my gun in my hand
i got plans and a place to be


lay down, lay down, lay down (lay down)
(oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah)
yeaaah
(oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah)
