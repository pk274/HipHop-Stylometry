yes i understand i done came a long way
from huggin them corners to appearin on tv
from choppin up nicks like this here feeds me
to makin 'em hits like this shit's easy
but it's not, it's a whole lot of bullshit involved
and truthfully, i'd rather be bullshittin with y'all
but i gotta chase the donuts, cocoa's growin
and it's like "oh shit, she was just born"
and now she knowin every song on the radio
if i hear another bow wow quotable (oh no)
grown as ever, school craft for ever
recognize real when i stare at ya, my niggas
i'm a hold you down, even when i'm not around
i'm just gone for now, i'll be back in a while
back in a while, yes (said i'll be back in a while)

never stuck in my dick in friends, just my down ass bitches
you know who you is like you know how
to get a sucker mothafucka's riches, y'all ain't shit
and when i touch back home, nigga, find me a bitch
with a fat ass, and no i ain't down to trick
that's asinine, i'm on the grind and i'm tryin to get rich
own a salon so y'all can gossip and get your wigs did
my ridettes from east to west
north to south, stab a bitch for runnin her mouth
five rugrats, big gun in the house, you run up in
you get stretched up out without a doubt, it's vicious

cause i'm probably asleep on your living room flo'
whether gold or plat, o. trice
always knows to go back, pass the carnac
crash the cadillac, nigga ain't shit changed
just a whole lot a change, a whole lot a brain
a whole lot a dates, a whole lot a thang
but hey i'm from the d, i got a whole lot a game
and i promise, i'm as thorough as you made me
detroit living, i'm in thoroughly with shady
