i’m from the gutter, i’m well aware of suffering
two brothers, one ratchet, stuck hustling
no love for them, the fuzz, they want to cuff ‘em
got to feed my loved ones, nigga, fuck ‘em
clutching the sandwich bag, that’s where the candy at
addicts rolling in wheelchairs, i serve ‘em handy cats
thought that’s where my answer’s at, heartless and the 
sometimes, you’re too real for it
i know your frustration, i’ve been casing that for ages
seems all the fake niggas taking their vacations
while we’re pushing freebase, facing incarceration
we ain’t floss hating, let the boys get paper
be patient, yours is in the making
loyalty never forsaken, lay and get your cake up
prior breakup never turn trice traitor
i cry ‘bout what life give ya, that’s your make up
maybelline cover up your nature, cup up
by any means seem is our equation, fuck’s up
is being mean until we hit it major, nut up


bme
nigga p8tience
obie trice
the hangover
take your time with this
