i don't see anything that could stand in our way


(i'm petty) got my gucci sneaks on
gucci tee on, get my gucci freak on
everything i wear got a gucci emblem
i'm so gucci gonna say i'm in a gucci zone
(i'm petty) got my louie v hat
with my louie backpack with the stacks in that
where the louie at? so you could pour another shot
cause, everything i rock louie v to the socks


who do it hotter in prada?
i ain't from n.y., do it m-y way, so sinatra
you know my (?) is not proper for the oscars
but i opt out for the oxfords in the oxford
... ha ha, that hurts
something by this oar got 'em tipping they fedoras
got the ladies being whores cause we're balling out stores
i coordinate on everything i wore
so ladies know him now say, "that was him before"
fresh as the core in my christian diors




got me smelling like chanel
well, that's my female, shorty gets that mail
in them transparent 90-millimeter heels
in them red bottoms showing off them christian lou-b's
heels... that's real
e-e-everything 'bout her scream dolce & gabanna
with the bowling ball bag showing out at caribana
lil' mama, she a stunner
tweed dress on, no panties up under
catch her on queens street balling at the boutiques, holla






i'm petty (x4)
