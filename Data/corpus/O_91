yeah, when swift said he witnessed the two-headed image
i'll admit, i thought it was o-b (overboard)
i'm thinkin' two sets of liquors may be runnin' through his system
that could distort what you foresee (drunk!)
but then the clue said the way his eyebrow was risen
while he tellin' the story
i made a stupid decision going through with what he's fearin'
that's why this can never be phoney (mmh-mmh)
listen, same alley, flashlight extra battery
now goin' out like black actors and actresses be
i'm an athlete gettin' out miraculously
that's when he jumped behind the trashcan after me
can barely swallow, runnin' while he follow
i'm a father, this will not be my departure
all set and done, when i was runnin' from the drama
only thing on my mind was "momma!"
