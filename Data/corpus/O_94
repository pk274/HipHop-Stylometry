obie trice, real name, no gimmicks
rap? i been in it ever since i was invented
that's 'cause a nigga live it
my records wield digits in history, nigga, you be the witness
i got the white boys mad at me
'cause em signed another black boy, like he nigga-happy
caucasians, marshall knows talent
obie trice a riot, that's why he's hired
i hit your raves, balloons and e's
and bang all your european pamela lee's
fucking ay, or how we say it round my way
"fo sho", trice gon' blow
then i'm off to them shows, i'm off across the globe
'til my accounts all swole for young kobie
pick things, act like you know me
not a soul can hold me, i'm here


that's why i ain't got no rap name
the name's obie trice
they see me on the streets, they be like, "yo, he nice!"
so i came to the game, real name, no gimmicks
rap, i live it, that's why i ain't got no rap name
the name's obie trice
they see me on the streets, they be like, "yo, he nice!"
so i came to the game, real name, no gimmicks

it didn't take much – one hot single
smiles and handshakes my man
the industry greeted me with open arms
with no type of flak 'cause o. trice got that
fugaze y'all rap, who gave y'all dat
new wave of mu-zack that you're all loving?
got your broads on my balls huggin'
even my next-of-kin's famous (obie's your cousin?!)
please believe it, i'm as "down to earth" as chris rock
gettin' hit by trucks, starin' at twat
a big cannon in ya g-spot
me not arrogant girl, me keep them freaks hot
whether or not you believe my status
i'm prepared to be the baddest on the rap that's happenin'
put the mitten back on the map with mathers and win this


that's why i ain't got no rap name
the name's obie trice
