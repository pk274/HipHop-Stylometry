breakin' the bread


220 on the boat, here's a toast to my folks
it's a holiday, crip, i'ma fuck with my locs
get dressed, so fresh, big s on my chest
now i'm finna work, yellow steeler shirt
501's with the stacy adams tips
picture a room full of long beach 20 crips
doin' this, who in this? you in this? we in this bitch
wish the dead homeboys was seein' this shit
neither, none, best 20 minutes or less
it's a c-walk contest, who do it the best?
right your set with the feet, skip along to the beat
represent your shit and bang out your street
for real though, king of the hill though
