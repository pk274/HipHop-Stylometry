gangsta party
up outta there, up outta there
ain't nothin' but a gangsta party, party, party
ayy, light that up why you actin' like that?
let me hit that
ain't nothin' but a gangsta party, party, party
(a toast to the coast)
ain't nothin' but a gangsta party, party, party
(a toast to the coast)
ain't nothin' but a gangsta party, party, party
nothin' but a gangsta party
(a toast to the coast)

sure 'nough, uh, it feels good
'cause they got me on the run
now i'm back in the courtroom, waitin' on the outcome
"free 2pac" it seems that's all that's on my mind
'cause at the same time, it seems they tryin' to take minе
so i'ma get smart and get defеnsive with this
and put together a million march with the (party) twist


i've got a pit named petey, she nigerina
i've got a house out in the hills right next to chino
and i think i've got a black beamer
but my dream is to own a fly casino
like bugsy siegel, and do it all legal
and get scooped up by the little homie in the regal
mmm, it feels good to you, baby-bubba
you see, this is for the g's and the keys, young hustler


ain't nothin' but a gangsta party
ain't nothin' but a gangsta party
nothin' but a gangsta party
ain't nothin' but a gangsta party
nothin' but a gangsta party
it ain't nothin' but a gangsta party
(boss playas)
ain't nothin' but a gangsta party
nothin' but a gangsta party
it ain't nothin' but a gangsta party
ain't nothin' but a gangsta party


it's like cuh, blood, gangbangin'
everybody in the party doin' dope-slangin'
you gotta have papers in this world
you might get your first snatch before your eyes swirl
you're doin' your job every day
and then you work so hard 'til your hair turns gray
let me tell you 'bout life and 'bout the way it is
you see, we live by the... (party)
