me, not him or them or they
i'm snoop east-wood, come and make my day
pa-pa-pack your bags and let's get away
to a place and space where you my bae
you never been, tell me have you ever been?
flown out to a state of mind where it's blown out
in stages for show, more pages to go
but if you read in between them lines and leave them bad times behind
back sipping that wine and i finally made you mine
i take you out to my mama house and wife you up in due time
don't that sound elegant to your brain cells?
left hand, now tell me how that ring feels
i'm still your man, gonna stay the same, can't change
let me be the one, this my campaign champagne
pop that, hit that, get that, got that, stop that
