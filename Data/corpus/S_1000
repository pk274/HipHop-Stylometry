one, two, mm-, yup
when it's the end of the weekend
but not quite the end of the weekend
check it out
it is what it is
you got me feelin'


you got me feelin' like chick-fil-a was open on a sunday
snoop, i know
we tried, it was closed
wouldn't that be great
check it out, this a hit
you can tell radio, all the djs will play it
'cause we got that hustle and flow
i'm feelin' good, feelin' fresh
feelin' blessed, little stress
and when i'm with you, i feel that joy inside my chest
what you feel just depends on what you see
but just don't take it from me
i'm just the d, o double g
