i wake up feeling like the most high's favorite child
cuz he gave me you
a breath of fresh air and a brand new morning
painted blue
i wake up blessed and highly favored just to see
another day was proof that
second chances come with every sunrise

shout it out to the world
ig posted it
if you get a second chance, you better make the most of it
i used to ride with the gun guys
blaze to the fun times
but nowadays, i just praise until the sunrise
been down so long
i’m used to falling, y’all
but i recognize, this my calling dawg
i been ordained, anointed with the oil
on the battlefield
loyal to the soil
i'm lookin’ at the man in the mirror
see now things is gettin’ much clearer
i got my own church, my own choir, my own band
i guess you could say, i’m a brand new man
see rap guys usually don't get baptized
but how could you cleanse your sins without it
make you wanna think about it, uh
right reverend the reverend right recite light
you see today is the day to get your life right
