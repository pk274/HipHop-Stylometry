it's just another, just another day that the lord has (kept me, kept me)
it was no goodness of my own
it was you and you alone
you deserve all the glory
peace signs in the sky if ya feel good


was a time when a storm came in my life
didn't know which way to turn, to the left or right
out the corner of my eye, saw a little light
flickerin' like a flame in the darkest night

a lotta people do me wrong, but i wanna do the right thing (right thing)
sit back with my pedal on the medal and i'm cruisin' on the highway
while you passin' out blessin's on your people
lord, shoot a  blessin' my way


you bring the sun out
you bring the sun out, sunshine
you bring the sun out
you bring the sun out, sunshine
sunshine-ine, sunshine-ine

in my hood
