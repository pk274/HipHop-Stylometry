lovey-dovey, you love me, love me, you're thinking of me
i put my dick on your back, see, ain't no sleeping on me
block-block, knock-knock, it don't stop
i lift your shirt up, skirt up and make your ass drop
on all fours, red wine with a blue rose
shit cool, a pitbull with a red nose
man, it's so hectic
i slip out and slip back in to redirect it, connect it
from the hip to the dip
she say she wanna fuck with a crip like nip so i dip
yeah, i bark and i bail
and get back into the ocean like a shark or a whale, don't tell (shh)
