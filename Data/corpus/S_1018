lot of yall talkin but yall really don’t do it
really don’t do it, really don’t do it
lot of yall speakin but yall really don’t do it
really don’t do it, really don’t do it
a lot of yall leakin, man yall really don’t do it
really don’t do it, really don’t do it
you like to talk about it but you really don’t do it
really don’t do it, let me show you how i do it
i do it, i do it, i do it
i do it, i do it, i do it
i do it, i did it, i do it
talkin loud and you sayin nothing


i bought a cadillac when i was 17 years old
with a fake id up in my bill fold
up out of high school shit about a year ago
if i don’t get rich fuck bitch then it’s a miracle
ready for this, ready for this
a whole life nigga, prepared for this
i’m lookin through the mirrors of my eyelids
i never live in silence, i’m flyin like a pilot
if the sea got though
he got flow, he like a tic-tac-hoe
so all you bitches and you niggas say you knew that hoe
money bitches and weed is who i do this for




jibba jabba, shit stack, don’t matter
nigga put yo muthafuckin gat up
now knuckle up, we go fist to fist
soon as you drop yo hip you gonna kiss the whip
buy it real quick, not no affiliate
you see years ago i stopped doin silly shit
so i can climb the ladder of success at my best
smoking everywhere i go and everyday i’m in the press
flyin in on the jet, hit the tarmac
in a whip that you can best bet
i’m from the east side but the west is where i rest at
and if my hair wasn’t locked up i’d go and get a wet set

talkin loud and you sayin nothing
talkin loud and you sayin nothing
talkin loud and you sayin nothing
talkin loud and you sayin nothing

we about it, we about it
we about it, we about it
we about it, we about it
don’t talk that shit

we about it, we about it
we about it, we about it
we about it, we about it
don’t talk that shit

cus you’ll get fucked up quick
get fucked up quick, get fucked up quick
get fucked up quick
don’t talk that shit
cus you’ll get fucked up quick
