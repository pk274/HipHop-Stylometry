rest in peace khaki's creased
from the east side of long beach
pouring out liquor, thinking about my homiex
cause i can't understand how it went down
we used to clown from town to town
claiming dogg pound
took you on lollapalooza with a nigga
l-dog you my nigga
if you don't get no bigger
spanky loco from the the dub, and little man from the i
dear god why them good niggas have to die
i can't reminisce too long
cause i'm in a war zone
if i sleep, slip, trip i might get blasted on
so i'm gone mash on home
but on the way i see some of my enemies
and they tripping on me
cause i'm fucking with master p
but i'm heated, so beat it
and another 87 case, i really don't need it
proceeded, i ain't gone cry for the homie
shit we gone celebrate
cause we know homeboy in a safer and better place


to all my thugs in the grave
see ya when i get there
see ya when i get there
to all my thugs in the grave
see ya when i get there
see ya when i get there
to all my thugs in the grave
see ya when i get there
see ya when i get there
to all my thugs in the grave
see ya when i get there
see ya when i get there
