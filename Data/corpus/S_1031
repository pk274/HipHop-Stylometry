i’m smoking everywhere i go
no stick, no seeds, just al green
i always gotta keep one rolled
i keep that, need that, got that
i’m rolling every gram i own
that purp, that bomb, that kush
don’t gotta understand, they know
i smoke that, fire that, good that good that


concentrated, everyday i’m faded
trees prepared and properly cultivated
i nursed ‘em, sprayed down, no chemicals
just me and my buddy, ya hear me now
never treat ya wrong, to each his own
snoop and wiz the new cheech and chong
we up in smoke, making street schemes
smoking sticky green, having sweet dreams
break it down, put it in the z-i zag
and pull the top back and let the ass drag
hit the switch, quickest way to get a bitch
executive branch, get a whiff of this
black card, sack of dank
high school nigga what the fuck you think?
i’m passing all my classes with flying colors
and everyday i’m high as a muthafucker


i’m smoking everywhere i go
no stick, no seeds, just al green
i always gotta keep one rolled
i keep that, need that, got that
i’m rolling every gram i own
that purp, that bomb, that kush
don’t gotta understand, they know
i smoke that, fire that, good that good that


i’m smoking everywhere i go
no stick, no seeds, just al green
i always gotta keep one rolled
i keep that, need that, got that
i’m rolling every gram i own
that purp, that bomb, that kush
don’t gotta understand, they know
i smoke that, fire that, good that good that
