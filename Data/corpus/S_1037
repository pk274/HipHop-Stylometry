can a real crip, get a lil' bit?
dump on a nigga for some silly shit
a hundred four rounds when the milli' kick, yeah
gang bang niggas who he really with (crip!)
and we don't talk to no motherfuckin' law
cooked up, caked up, slangin' that raw, nigga
roll through the city, of violence
bangin' with the loud or the silencer
leave him on the floor with his brains spilled out
tanners, scanners, bananas peeled out
back to the set, no sweat, ducked off
come through the hood and you will get fucked off
nigga, this's crip on my, two times
don't give a fuck and we'll bust him one time, nigga
what y'all thought? we criss to cross
you miss, your loss, we settin' it off, cuh
