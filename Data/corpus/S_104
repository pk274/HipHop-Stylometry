now if you tired of the hard work
tears and sweat
and you breakin' your neck
and you still up in debt
walkin' round town all strapped in
niggas be havin' more bad times than captain rat did
two strikes none left, out of breath
livin' in the city it's a jungle yo
all this deception on top of stress
you havin' more problems than a algebra test
you can't seem to come up, wit yo' money for rent
and now yo' baby momma trippin' she want fifty percent
it's a thin line, between yours and mine
the difference is you gotta scratch to a get nickel and dime
now i know a place where
ya' might wanna be and i can take you there
pop goes the nine, we'll go right behind
you can slide off your shoes sit back and recline


come and go with me to doggylaaaaaaaaaaaaand!!
(here ye, here ye, come one come all)
to a place that be, call it lbc
(i'm ridin' wit'cha baby)

oh your homies think you're funny?
doin' stick ups for moneys
just to impress the honeys (this is for the honeys)
got yo' rocks, so you keep'em in the sack
you got two strikes, but you right back up to bat
you all about yo' money and got something to sell
but if you bail for a robber you'll be back in the jail cell
you chillin' wit yo' feet up
someone hated but baby without the homies and
that's when you got beat up
because you can't be out there doin' low
and then right gather up yo' crew and roll
ain't no rules when you out there doin' dirt
somebody's always layin' in the cut to get ya' hurt
but see, i know a place where
you might wanna be
and i can take you there
pop goes the nine, we'll go right behind
you can slide off your shoes sit back and recline

lemme holla to a little home boy real quick
know what i'm sayin'?
cuz he travelin' in the fast lane
stop the life it seem that we are on
time to slow your roll
let doggyland be your new home
stop the life you save may be your own
time to slow your roll
let doggyland be your new home


doggyland is the town where it's goin' diz-owne
(it's goin' down)
everything is free
and ain't no hiv. (what?)
and niggas don't kill one another
(oh really why is that?)
because a brother is a brother
(and what about the mothers?)
they queens
righteous
man
heaven must be like this
green aroma like the grass in the summertime
ain't no peneteneries and ain't nobody doin' time
and oh yeah, i'm the big o-k'er
i'm smarter than the senator
bigger than the mayor
heaven on earth
it's like a prayer
and you can't get in without yo' gold card you got
to be a player
now you know a place where
you gots to be and i took you there
pop goes the nine, we'll go right behind
you can slide off your shoes sit back and recline
