what can i say to you that you ain't never heard?
i'm breakin' it down, shawty, i'm talkin' 'bout every word
observe how i splizz-erve, slick like a iceberg (what?)
cold with the wizz-ords and lit like my izz-erd (ah)

ain't nothin' wrong with this, now peep it out
and if it's too hard, then go ahead and bleep it out
see, i'ma tell you what i see 'cause what i see is all i know
i'll wrap you up with a bow, lay you out on the floor
and let tory tell the story 'cause you know how it go
then hit the switch in my blue '64, mmh-mmh
