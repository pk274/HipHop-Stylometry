the sky is blue and i am too, i'm eyein' you
i wanna be inside of you
the way you dance, take a chance and let me talk
and let me get you higher, boo
my buddy, way too cool, lil' cutty
get a shot of moscato and lil' mama get slutty
on the real, though
let me tell you how i feel, though
she ain't fuckin' with no weirdo
so back the fuck up out my face
straight out the bottle, i don't need no chase
i wanna freak with you, for a week or two
surprise, open your eyes, peek-a-boo
