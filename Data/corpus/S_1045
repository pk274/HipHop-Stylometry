she got a donkey
she got it
da donk, da donk, da donk
she got it (she got it)
da donk


s, n, double o, p, that's me
chilling with my nephew will.he.be
all these ladies in the place to be
all of them on with the big donkey
(the big donkey?) the big booty (oh)
all on me cause they all love me
i wanna a little some of that all y'all sweet
the beat goes boom baba boom boom boom
there's so much ladies in the place to be
kinda hard being snoop d, o, double g
but i, somehow, some way
keep on coming up making on chicks like every single day
may i show you a little something for
you, and me, and your friends
could go out with all that donkey
give it here, girl don't say nothing
