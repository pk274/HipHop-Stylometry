guess who's back in the motherfuckin' house
with a fat sack and a dick for your mouth
nigga comin' back with hoes, money and clout
and tryin' to show y'all what this shit is really about
now, i can kick it with b or light up the heat
or holler at p, turn up the beat
bangin' the fo', the low-low that is
or slang dodo or coco, fo' sho' that is
but i ain't even trippin' no more
i'm like the six million dollar man, nigga in slow-mo
go bro, take this shit as far as ya ever been
shit i'm tryin' to go places, ain't no nigga never been
but then, niggas steady tryin' to twist me
in the pen i got the whole crip card with me
come get me, y'all niggas know where i'm at
ain't no limit to this shit, just know that
nigga know that, we show that
