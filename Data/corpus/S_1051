top dogg, bite 'em all, nigga, burn the shit up
d-p-g-c, my nigga, turn that shit up
c-p-t, l-b-c, yeah, we hookin' back up
and when they bang this in the club, baby, you got to get up
thug niggas, drug dealers, yeah, they givin' it up
lowlife, yo' life, boy, we livin' it up
takin' chances while we dancin' in the party for sure
slipped my ho a forty-fo' when she got in the back do'
bitches lookin' at me strange, but you know i don't care
step up in this motherfucker just a-swangin' my hair
bitch, quit talkin', crip walk if you down with the set
take a bullet with some dick and take this dope on this jet
out of town, put it down for the father of rap
and if yo' ass get cracked, bitch, shut yo' trap
come back, get back, that's the part of success
if you believe in the x, you'll be relievin' your stress


la-da-da-da-dah
it's the motherfuckin' d-r-e (dr. dre, motherfucker!)
la-da-da-da-dah
