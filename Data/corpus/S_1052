da da da da da
it's the one and only d-o-double-g (snoop dogg!)
da da da da da
you know i'm mobbin' with the d.r.e
(hope you ready for the next episode)
there they go, there they go, there they go, there they go
there they go, there they go, there they go, there they go
there they go, there they go, there they go, there they go
there they go, there they go, there they go, there they go


who am i
mr. d-o-g, he's fine
i don't fuck with 8's just 9's and dimes
holla at me dog, i'm tryna find some time
and if i do, we'll sit back and recline
untill then, you can put your mind on mine
and we can have a good time
i put my dick on your spine
hit you from behind, make your sun shine
i won't tell, oh bitch quit lying
matter o' fac' ho, get off my line
cos right about now, i need my peace of mind
sippin' hennesy with a twist of lime
smoking on a dime, beach, snortin' a line
calvin, not calvin klein
original, so genuine
my office hours are from, 10 to 5
god bless you and good night is how i end my rhyme
but meanwhile
(fades)
