cheaper the keeper
believe me, i'm in my fever
body bagger, a sleeper
fill up the green reaper
keep up what you can keep up
sneak up when we all creeped up
there be no sequels or equals 'cause this is for my peoples
now gather around so i can break it down and educate
and tryna elevate, teach you how to bake a cake
wake up, wake up, see time is running out, no?
you keep a closed mouth, stay on the right row
and take the time out, i come to find out
