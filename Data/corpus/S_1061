this the itty-bitty nigga from the city they call lb
what you know about the d-o-g?
i keep my peeps wit' a bag of treats
on the streets my nephews beat that beat and keep that heat
in the cut and indiscrete
me and dub-c crippin' cousins in this industry
a lot of y'all pretend to be
wanna 'ce' friends wit' me, and then wanna sleep wit the enemy?
want some, get some, bad enough take some
suckas poppin' off, i'm 'bout to take one
break son, make done, don't want none
and just 'cause we talkin', what you doin' c-walking?
it's not just a dance, it's a way of living
now if ya c-walking, ya best to 'ce' crippin'
and that goes for kids too, and r&b singers
nigga, quit crip walking if you ain't a gangbanger
