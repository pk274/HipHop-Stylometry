i wake up early in the morning and it feels so good
smoking on some shit that you wish you could
jealousy envy, please don't feel bad
this weed is mine get your own bag
a sack full of og under locking key
none for the homies this is all for me
got a blunt looking like a cali palm tree
police roll by, i got nothing on me
cause the smoke is already in the air
i am loped up two braids in my hair
all star with the khaki suit
i'm gonna fuck around and take it to the classic snoop
on the east side standing on the vip
back then the only red was my dye
used to pyt and you're looking so fine
i am sorry baby girl but tonight


get back to the episode, sacks for the chronic
out of this world, could relax on a comet
this is church music listen to the choir
to burn my kush you must use fire
dogg like never heard before
smoking that bomb like thc-4
west coast world wide sea shore to sea shore
when is the last time you've seen a g in a g4
don't worry i'll wait
time is ticking i'm tripping
i'm slipping, i'll wait
into a zone where the whores on my dog bone
a dog whistle and they download my ring tone
and she so hypnotized by this pimp poem
what i got here is mine go get your own
i put this to rhymes get piece of mind
ozs to dimes and this weed is mine


i got a roll for you
do you wanna smoke with me
i wanna smoke with you(i wanna smoke with you)
do you wanna smoke with me
i got a roll for you(i got a roll for you)
do you wanna smoke with me(do you wanna smoke)
i wanna smoke with you do you do you (do you)
do you wanna smoke with me(i said wanna smoke with you)
do you wanna smoke with me(i wanna smoke with you)
