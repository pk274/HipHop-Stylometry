california love
as we ride for the westside
i see they shotgun for the coast
in that lowride
hittin' corners with the game, posted up in the back (what's up, holmes)
snoop ridin' the trey {ooohwee}
palm trees and hoodrats
pimps, macks and ballers, makin' dollars up on this boulevard
ride up in the barrio, face of the next hood star
handle bars, white tees and the panotins
tie the local white g's, slangin' the white cold medicine
just got signed
and i'm out of my time
they said i'm the new chronic, ese, 2009
the world is mine, but my name ain't scarface
something similar
for the whole coast to embrace
paper chasin', pushin' weight, america's catastrophe
puttin' the history channel back
to reality
mad at me
for california's return
i'm like the l.a. riots, we keep the city left burned

repeat chorus twice


i'm a ghostface killah, in a stellar 300
snoopy d-o-double g, i'm about rip, rip, run it
i give it to you all, i bounce, shoot and ball
i'm the king, but the king don't fall
i'm not like lebron
i'm more like kobe
i want the rings
the bitches
the money and the glory
see, this a westside story
so it's gon' get messy, gangsta and sort of gory
but i'm
vincent price
eastside 20 crip
so i might throw up the set twice
i ain't to set up tight
roll your dice
run up on the dogg, motherfucker
and you lose your life
don't trip, holmes
i'm tryin' to get mines on
groupies and
