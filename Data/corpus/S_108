best friend, girl, i never thought that i'd fuck your best friend
girl, i never thought that i'd fuck your best friend…
cause she was your best friend
girl, i never thought that i'd fuck your best friend


best friend, girl, i never thought that i'd fuck your best friend
girl, i never thought that i'd fuck your best friend…
cause she was your best friend
girl, i never thought that i'd fuck your best friend


jostlin', rustlin', they both in love and that
they always be, like, rubbin' it
i'm slowly deeply shovin' it
take it out, toss it up, now, baby, juggle it
i'm always hustin'
every time we fuckin' and your best friend bustin'
damn, if she get a sneak peek…
i take her out next week and give the bitch mouth to me
tell her what it's 'bout to be, she never goin' out wit' me
i knew you had an eye for me, i banged her on your balcony
chiefin' in the next room, i slid into the restroom
she came in, game in, what am i to do?
little old me, put dick in your motherfuckin' homie
how could i do better? i never knew now
give a fuck, bitch, i'm a true player
confessin' nothin' less than the best and…
put the west in, i fuck your best friend


best friend, girl, i never thought that i'd fuck your best friend
girl, i never thought that i'd fuck your best friend…
cause she was your best friend
girl, i never thought that i'd fuck your best friend
