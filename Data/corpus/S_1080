why is there suddenly a nigga trippin' when i do it?
why do everybody else gon' have a war, have beef
within the music, talkin' about differences and it's ok
it's music it's hip-hop it's groundbreaking
when i do it, it's war


slip this with the crip stick
itty bitty nigga with the slick shit
in a room full of misfits
plug it in, let it bang, yea my shit bitch
get bread like bisquick
you're a soft ass nigga with a face full of lipstick
let me show you how a crip dip
get ships and flips and take low trips
i sipps that shit ain't talking 'bout lean
down to mississippi and new orleans
word as a motherfucka, let me verb that
snoop dogg is a hog, yea i heard that
you deserve that swerve that 'lac
make it bang, let it go, bring that back
i blew they brain, nephew yea do that thang


i see myself changing the world
because my thought patterns are so opposite of the norm
so i will have to change the world
or i will have to be changed by the world
