(ride, ride!)
yeah, yeah, we like to float and ride
smoke when they lock, the homie got the rope and they glide
they see us like smoke when they rot
huntin' rappers and they hoping they hot
gang bangers, yeah, they local in they block
low riders, yeah, stroke and they high
college brains, yeah, they smoke on they pot
'till it's old gang cold, and it's meant to be sold
stay tuned 'till the next episode, when we ride and roll
if he fake, he foe, if he real let the story be told
in a land where you will be exposed
ogs, hood rats, and the punk po-pos
hard to grab fo' toes, and dip low lows
ride slow with the top pulled back
pulling on some of that, sippin'  on some 'yac
stars with the mars, splurges with murs
blank out and make out
stay way up, cause it's about to go down, for real


you're listening to the beautiful sounds of latoiya williams, and my main man murs, featuring snoop d-o double g, it's going down, produced by niggarachi
