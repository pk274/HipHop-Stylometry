i'm waking up in the morning, man i'm mourning; what's wrong?
my nigga corleone gone in my zoning, but i'm boning, out to school
cause i can't be late, cause they'll lock the gate
and it's damn near eight, that's when the bell ring
i'm a slide on in, and come right on in
and once i bail through the hallways, giving it up
funky fresh stars and khakis, cool living it up
what up? - the same shit trying get paid and stay strong
lunchtime, i make my way to get my grub on
ten minutes to one, feeling good like i should for sure
fourth period; walk through the door
i'm wreaking and smelling like endo
but still the day moves on to 2:44; one minute left to class
by warren g, the twins and daz
nate dogg finna scoop us up in a blue drop top brouham
i hear some bitches from wilson wanna tag.. along
and get up, for the get-down
word got around about the niggas from the piddound
we keep the whores on point, to join on lit
and keep heat discreet, until the shit jump off
well we're all from the side, so we won't ask why
so you best get high!
