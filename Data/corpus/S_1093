huh
right back in your motherfucking ass
twenty, twenty twenty-two, two, two, two
yes, yes
hand me that fire
let me light this shit up, my nigga


i gotta be, i gotta be a better me
top dog, whole 'nother pedigree
snoop dogg, ain't none of y'all ahead of me
i'm all peace, no beef, so i'ma let it be
splitting a backwoods, sitting up under a tree
i'm thinking back, this is right where i wanted to be
dpgc
feet in the sand as i dance on your tv
yeah, i make this shit look organic
and this is from the most recognized on the planet
damn it
and you haters can't stand it
but can't do nothing 'cause that's just how i planned it
back to the batcave, follow my rap maze
real hip-hop, come up out of them whack ways
i see you niggas been brainwashed
i'm cut from the cloth of this shit called hip-hop
don't stop, won't stop, nigga, we sure shot
slide in the six-four, that bitch is so hot
death row records, yeah, dog, we twist 'em
west coast baby right back in your system


we ran the whole summer, winter, fall, and spring
from def jam back to this death row thing
and now i'm in control, so i call the shots
i'm sitting at the table
i run my own label
i-n-d-e-p-i-m-p
grown-er, owner-s-h-i-p
told you, showed you to follow my blueprints
i see a lot of y'all tiptoeing my shoeprints
walk that walk, nephew, it's yours
two plus two plus three plus four
private jets, sunsets at the door
marble floors with pristine d√©cor
this is the life i chose, rock on the roll
pot full of gold, never sold my soul
stay suited and booted, keep it in the cut with me
just a touch away, that's why you fuck with me


yeah, you better know it
death row records
we done already took over the metaverse
so now we back in the universe
haha
