never knew, what you gonâ€™ do? (what you gon' do?)
knock 'em down, i'm from the knock-a-ho tribe, look around
nigga catch the vibe, voodoo
go to war with the zulu, and i'm shaka
spray 'em all with the blocka
oh my, niggas gon' die
"cut they heads off" is the war cry
fight the power and fuck four-five (fuck four-five)
we ain't forgot that boat ride (boat ride)
kill 'em all at low tide (at low tide)
got soldiers on both sides
gangbangin' in low rides
tribal, machetes, rifle
train up the young ones, repeat the cycle
hit 'em with the glycerine, i got the nitro
niggas ain't listenin', i grab the microphone, tell 'em who to ride on
