real shit my nigga, look


i got my motherfuckin' back to the wall
fightin' the power, attackin', no pause
hat to the back, i'm black with a cause
gat to your jaws, affirmative action and laws
ain't helpin' my niggas so we takin' back what we lost
we got bombs and hand grenades strapped to your boss
niggas for real and not fuckin' around
you suckas and clowns get beat down for your actions involved
everybody go, everybody get it (everybody)
fuck the law, kill it, i ain't fuckin' with it (where the shotty?)
make 'em all feel it, fuck them nine minutes, everybody seen it
brush it off, nah, we set it off by any means necessary
niggas lettin' off, the revolution is televised
we seein' the hatred, so i'm back to the basics
strapped up and i'm waitin', cool calm and i'm patient
leave, fuck with mines, you stuck in a bind
that's real talk, no make believe, i'm easy to find


yeah, nigga, i'm out here on the west coast
yeah, where the grass is greener and the crips are much meaner
