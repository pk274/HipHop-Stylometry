hmm, i spent the night at the homie's house, shit
slept in his livingroom, on his couch
nigga high'n a motherfucker burnt out (shit)
before you know it, god damn, the homie chirped out (damn!)
and he ain't said shit, he just dip in his seville as he peel
left me at the pad with his girl, damn, what the deal?
now baby got a gown on, gettin her clown on
as she slid downstairs, now she takin me down home
cheatin in the next room in the homeboy's bedroom
am i wrong? shit, on and on and on and on
now what am i to do if you was me and i was you
his baby momma in my face, she shakin poo-poo, what would you do?
trust is a motherfuckin loco, shit
and so is temptation, and i don't know what i'mma do
come on through (come on through) so i can cum on you (cum on you)
shit if the homey knew (if the homey knew) if the homey knew
(if the homey knew)
