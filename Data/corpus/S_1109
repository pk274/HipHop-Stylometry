what you talkin' 'bout dawg?
what you mean, lil' homie?
play the post when you ball
all these niggas up on me
how you keep that baby face, and how you keep it so fresh?
and how you keep it look like a beacon, wish i was like that fresh
hard times, flat lines
stay in my lane, you see
boxed in, but i boxed out
niggas don't wanna box with me
don't billy coze, don't break the rules, just stay true to this shit
stay bopin', dopin', with the top open and the cool nuts from the city oakland
