i'm all to my lonely, it's a trip
how the pigs wanna separate me from all my homies
then put me on probation
i'm living in this united nations
i'm facing, a cold situation
ain't this a son of a bitch?
but you know imma twist a new route for this paper
homie, hear me out
they ban me in the uk, but i'm still gon turn it up
what for? and i don't even know law
but imma still lay low, and holla out hello
to all my kinfolks, and
