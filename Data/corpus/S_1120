i falls off into a party in the nyc
niggas lookin' at me strange but they lovin' my chain
bang bang, same thang, game came when i left 'em
i do it by my lonely, now, i'm the big homie


i'm snoop dogg, i'm smooth and imperial
i wake up every mornin' to my lucky charms cereal
times get drastic, yeah, i'm a classic
dogg pound gangsta chokin' off that boombastic


haven't you heard? i'm loose, shook the feds like the juice
snoop dogg is 121st proof
fool, you's a deuce-deuce of some genuine draft
i'm genuine like vintage wine, and all about cash
cash, cash, so indeed i got the weed
and keep the lighter for the hash
has it ever been a time when you didn't have a dime
and the only way to get it was to go and do a crime?


i'm 26, still in the mix
my hair gettin' longer, my game gettin' stronger
a nigga been on one, i thank god
'cause life in the city of stars is gettin' hard
and it's odd, for a g to get a job
so i'd rather steal and rob and mob with my squad
my homie used to bang, now he follow farrakhan
used to read the source, now all he reads is the holy qu'ran
time brings change and change brings time
listen to me hit ya with this gangbang rhyme
nigga, whattup?! who up? you up!
doggy dogg is on the mic, i'm here to fuck it izzzup
i give it to y'all, like you really gotta have it
dogg pound gangstaz, boy, this shit is gettin' tragic
but i'mma make me a grip and dip quick
and fuck with my nigga kid capri on this g shit
dial tail and bail with my nigga slick ricky
and all you niggas talkin' bullshit can just miss me
can't twist me, you fuckin' paper haters
i'm dippin' in my '98 gold navigator
i'm dippin' like a lo-lo
bouncin', smokin ounces', fo' sho', tho
