i'm smokin' all up in the club
i'm gettin' what i want with the landi in my cup
i'm wantin' more than one, i'm all about the ball
i'm in it for a second, the moment, the minute
today and tomorrow, i'm in it for the ball
and she is too see 'cause she all up on the dogg
this is what i'm gon' do, ball 'til i fall
me and mya in the back of the party
gettin' love by everybody, gettin' higher
the ladies just love snoop d-o-doub'
they say i walk just like and my talk is light
matter of fact i led a boss's life
