wanna dress like, wanna talk like us
wanna be like, wanna walk like us
nigga used to be soft, now you wanna be tough
used to be in your video, shaking like ugh?!
you motherfuckers be doing too much
wanna be hating now you wanna be us
i oughta really be clapping at y'all
but instead i’m straight laughing at y’all
then a nigga had the nerve to say fuck snoop dogg
cuz got a perm and he just brought a coupe ya’ll
tattooed l.b.c. on him and every little g in the streets want in
they talking about cuz ain’t from the set
and when they catch him in the hood, he gon get checked
young g you better be where you say you’re from
where you from, cuz? wannabes
niggas gon hit you up, what it do crip?
niggas want everything, even your bitch!
used to be jewelry, and just your whip
nowadays everybody is in it for the chips
my grandmamma living in the south
understand me she even had to tell me what it’s about
say the white kids on the block wanna get a flex
say they love me like elvis, ain’t that a bitch?
