lay low, getting' this weed money, me and my cous'
yeah, you know how we do
but i wanna hold that baby for a minute now
see, about to knock 'er
see what it takes for her to be knocked
what it is, trip

(x2)
baby, what's yo' pleasure?
i be there for you, baby!
even through stormy weather

(x2)


see, that's why we push it
and go faster
tell me how to get it on
if you got the septic on the phone
we go and smoke it off to this door?
