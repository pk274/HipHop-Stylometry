big subwoofer bouncin' like a trampoline
glass shake when i roll past the scene
candy apple paint drippin' classic green
everybody eatin', you can ask the team
fast and mean, speakers bumpin', tags is clean
keep me somethin' to smoke on
bad bitch to poke on, bass hittin' like a earthquake
you niggas hold on, i hit the block and roll on
