never caught slippin, keep my heat on the dash
(when drama came, drama came, then came murder) x2


ridin through the backwoods, late night creepin
lookin for a gimp, stuntin like a pimp
i stopped by the waffle house to get some grits and toast
man a nigga sure do miss the west coast
folks i never had drama that my mama didn't prepare me for
but this one time couldn't nobody save me loc
shit got thick, i'm with this bitch, say she down with the clicque
and all i want to do was get my dick licked
rule number one, keep the heater close by
i can't believe that bitch would set me up, she was so fly
why do bitches set niggas up, huh bro
why niggas don't give a fuck
i wear the mud among fiend and magic, it's tragic how it went down
tru tank dogs on a mission with the dogg pound
layin niggas down, fool how that sound
down south, hustlin for cash
never slippin, keep my heater on the dash
