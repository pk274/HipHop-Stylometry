ayo, jason
(oh, yeah?)
say somethin' to her, holla at her
haha, i got one question
haha, how do you fit, all that
in them jeans? hahaha


'cause you know what to do with that big fat butt? (oh, yeah)
wiggle, wiggle, wiggle
wiggle, wiggle, wiggle (wiggle wiggle wiggle)
wiggle, wiggle, wiggle (shake it, shake it, girl)
just a little bittle (little bittle, little bittle, little bittle)
swing!


shake what your mama gave you, misbehave you
i just wanna strip you, dip you, flip you, bubble bathe you
what they do, taste my raindrops, 'kay, boo?
now what you're willing, what you wanting, what you may do
completely separated 'til i deeply penetrate it
then i take it out and wipe it off, eat it, ate it, love it, hate it
overstated, underrated, everywhere i been
can you wiggle, wiggle for the d-o-double g again?


you know what to do with that big fat butt?
wiggle, wiggle, wiggle (wiggle, wiggle, wiggle)
wiggle, wiggle, wiggle (wiggle, wiggle, wiggle)
wiggle, wiggle, wiggle (shake it, shake it, girl)
just a little bittle (oh, woah; little bittle, wiggle, wiggle, wiggle)
wiggle, wiggle, wiggle


now make it clap
wiggle, wiggle, wiggle
now make it clap
wiggle, wiggle, wiggle
now make it clap (love it when you do it like that)
just a little bittle (no hands, baby, make it clap, clap, clap, like)
now make it clap, clap, clap
swing!
