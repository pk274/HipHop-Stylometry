sleigh bells ring, are you listening?
in the lane, snow is glistening
a beautiful sight, we're happy tonight
walking in a winter wonderland


gone away is the bluebird
here to stay is a new bird
he sings a love song
while we stroll along
walking in a winter wonderland
in the meadow we can build a snowman
will pretend that he is parson brown
he'll say: are you married?
we'll say: no man
but you can do the job
when you're in town


later on, we'll conspire
(here comes santa claus)
as we dream by the fire
(here comes santa claus)
to face unafraid
the plans that we've made
walking in a winter wonderland
in the meadow we can build a snowman
(bells are ringing, children singing)
will pretend that he is parson brown
(all is merry and bright)
we'll have lots of fun with mr. snowman
(hang your stockings and say your prayers)
until the other kiddies knock him down
(cause santa claus comes tonight)


when it snows, ain't it thrilling
(here comes santa claus)
though your nose gets a chilling
(here comes santa claus)
we'll frolic and play the eskimo way
(here comes santa claus)
walking in a winter wonderland
(cause santa claus comes tonight)
when it snows, ain't it thrilling
(here comes santa claus)
though your nose gets a chilling
(here comes santa claus)
we'll frolic and play the eskimo way
(here comes santa claus)
walking in a winter wonderland
(cause santa claus comes tonight)


once upon a time in the lbc
santa came up missing, he was sitting by a tree
his reindeers were near but their leader wouldn't lead
so i took the lead, now as we proceed
this ain't for no mistletoe, but you need to listen, yo
just in case you didn't know, i call this my christmas flow
i can take you higher, higher, chestnuts roast on an open fire
gone away, think that's what the, what the song say


gone away is the bluebird
(here comes santa claus)
here to stay is a new bird
(here comes santa claus)
he sings a love song
while we stroll along
(here comes santa claus)
walking in a winter wonderland
(cause santa claus comes tonight)
a beautiful sight, what we have tonight
(here comes santa claus)
walking in a winter wonderland
(cause santa claus comes tonight)
ho, ho, ho
