damn a nigga only got 20 dollars shit
check this out


nigga 20 dollars to my name
deep in this dice game
i dust off my knees
i fucked off two g's
nothing left to do, but buy some shells for my glock
why? so i can rob every known dope spot
i'm having hard times, grit, and grind
shit i'm trying to get mine
ain't nothing to lose plus i'm living on the frontline
it's a cold twist the way that shit goes
gotta keep your hands on some motherfuckin' fetty yo
and keep a down bitch for when your money run out
and get you gun out
and shoot'em up 'til they come out
i'm blowing in the wind
it feels good my friend
silkk brought the gin & juice and my nigga chipped in
i'm amongst killers with a dub in my pocket loc
a drug dealer at the same time i love to smoke
but if i wasn't in this rap game
would a nigga snoop dogg have 20 dollars to my name
