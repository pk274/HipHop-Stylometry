mmm, let's make this official
shine yo' boots and load yo' pistols

posted up west coasted up and sippin on some remi?
believe me - it ain't easy been deezy (nah it ain't)

call it what you wanna, keep the heat up on the
east, long beach, california - spinnin like a 'tona
bangin on the corner, hot like a sauna
so you best to back up off me or i'll put this straight up on ya
