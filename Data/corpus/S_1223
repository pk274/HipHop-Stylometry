love, and devotion, water, to the ocean
this is what we wanted, kissin', in the mornin'
pressin', my clothes, cookin', my meals
wearin', that yes, dress just to kill
i'm so exuberant lovin' how you keep movin' it
rain drops, pain stops, baby girl you keep doin' it
hold on, were two in it, nothin' could ever ruin it
your feelin' on me, now your smellin' on me
uh, see my aroma makes you feel a certain way
and it's just like a holiday
everyday of the year with a hundred thousand doves flyin' way in the air
see peace is the symbol of get real close to me baby girl gimme love
lay ya head right there, sing somethin' soft in my ear
