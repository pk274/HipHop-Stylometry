what's up snoop, you ready?
yeah
go ahead man
this for all the playas and the pimps, not for the simps
you and the pimp getcha boogie on right about now
let's jam


from the very first day i was put in it
i had to tell myself that i was in it to win it
puttin' the mack down at an early age
two steps ahead of my peers so switch to the next phase
early '85 tryna clock a grip
no time for that wick-wack gangbang shit
i was tryna find a way to get richer
and if ya ass caught slippin', dogg's gonna getcha
that's how it was and that's how it is
you think i'm finna change cause i'm in the hip-hop biz
ain't nuthin' change but the weather and my shoe size
livin' on the streets'll make a dumb nigga wise
that's why i stay one-up on ya
everybody think them gangstas is runnin' california
well ya wrong and i'mma show ya
the game of a g, is what i'm finna throw ya
if you can handle it, but if ya can't, give it back
see this for the true hardened-macks
the pimps, not the wimps or the simps
takin' bitches out to eat steak and shrimp, dude
but who ya better do for these nuts
chill out and peep out the rest of the cut
cause i'm a young playa who's afraid to change
i'd rather stay handlin', be true to the game


now i ain't sayin' i don't treat a woman right
there's certain extent, you better know when to get tight
but i ain't the one to preach and teach
but these trick-ass niggas took the shit outta reach
takin' her out to eat then takin' her out to shows
but when it's time to get the ass, them nuts is frozen
and you know why my brother?
because you let the bitch now that you love her
and that's what she's supposed to do
ya payin' a hoe to keep close to you
you'd do much better on the boulevard
you spend all ya money and dick still hard
you tryna go out like babyface
the money was a waste and youse a disgrace
to the niggas who put the game down so deeply
pumpin' up loud for the niggas that sleep g
for some reason they don't hear me though
and this is the shit that ya gotsta know
if ya plan on having a woman nowadays
because a woman nowadays has got to stay paid
and simp-ass niggas put dents in the game
you know who you are, i ain't gon' say ya name
and get a little fame and start conflict
cause i'm a young mack daddy havin' shit
so you can go and make that change
but a nigga like dogg is stayin' true to the game


oh man, i think i got too deep on the last verse
but you know how i am, i really don't give a fuck
cause a bitch is a bitch and a bitch is gonna stay a bitch
as long as a nigga broke, but when he get rich
watch how her attitude changes
she wanna start comin' around and then maintainin'
a grip on you and a grip a on ya grip
but i ain't the one to try to trip that trick
let's see, cause i'm loyal to game
that's why i always maintain and keep my brain in the right frame
just in case that happens
the way that i live is the way that i'm rappin'
don't be offended because i speaks the truth
i can't help it but i'm that og playa they call snoop
yes, the fly human being, not european
but i managed to keep singin'
cause ya know that i'm a g in any field i put my heart at
i'm the mack and i'm packin'
yeah, and what i was really talkin' about was this
it's somethin' that's crucial but not like a diss
it's just to the brothas who keep spendin'
ain't nuthin' wrong with lendin' but you keep sendin'
mo' money, mo' money, mo' money
but when ya get broke watch how she get funny
and don't wanna neva eva wanna show up
the the words gonna get around thatcha to' up
then who you gonna kick it with?
you can't chill with the homies cause they say you a trick
and ya know tricks are for kids, silly rabbit
it turns into a habit, now you on bankrupt status
i ain't the pips but i'm damn sure glad it's not a playa like me in yo' shoes
because i don't wanna cry about the mack daddy blues
now if you upset and wanna throw them thangs
i suggest for ya best and trust change
all up in crazy thoughts
and for my paper, the vapors, is whatcha just caught
doggy dogg feelin' a lil' pain
i'm just a g from the beach stayin' true to the game


i hope i got my point across the way i wanted to
sorry my brother, if you feel i fronted you
but that's how i am i don't nuttin' back
and that's the number one rule of bein' a mack
rule two, money first and that's a must
all gold-diggin' hoes tryna creep get crushed
and the most important thang
is to always stay down and be true to the game
