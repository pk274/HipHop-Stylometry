what the fuck's goin on wit you niggas, y'all tryin to play a low pro
and tryin ta be hard and tryin ta be big willies or whatever they call it
i guess it's time for me to act just like an alcoholic
and step to the game, i'm a stumble in like i don't know
and if a nigga say somethin wrong, i'm takin off from the get-go
i ain't givin no room to try to get me first
cos i done been bombed on before and i'mma tell you, man, that's the worst
fifth in the world, but i'mma keep my thang together
cos i'mma keep makin money and hope everything is still together
havin papers, man, now what y'all niggas doin?

cos i'mma do mines and i'mma keep everything tight
i ain't lettin nothin leak cos if thangs leak, then i'm get caught
and i can't get caught cos you know how they do it about that child support

but i ain't gonna be payin no bitch, no no, no way dogg
i'm too slick on my toes, i'm too tight

guaranteed to put it down and we'll be 'round to your town
so just sit in your seats and wait 'til we come through
until we do just keep smokin grey and blue
or whatever you do just stay true to what you do
cos we gone keep doin what the fuck we got to do
