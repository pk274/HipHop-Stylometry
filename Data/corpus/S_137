i took two nickels and made a dime out it
i took two words and made a rhyme out it
it's hard to explain it, but i did it while i'm tainted
steady rippin' while i'm crippin', dip the shine out
i check my rear view
i tip it down a little, just to get a clear view
i got the pigs on me, i got the dips on em
so i slide, swerve, and try to dip on em
make a smooth getaway, so clean
my windows smoke green, my endo super supreme
when the lights hit the bitch that shit turns green
but in the daytime, that motherfucker whip cream
