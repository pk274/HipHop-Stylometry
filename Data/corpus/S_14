long beach done come together now you know you in trouble
if you came in to the beach without snoop d-o double
look, we hear the haters talking that don't mean that we listen
i'm to busy chasing dreams i don't see competition
daisy dukes bitch cruises through the city
and that ass fat make that bike pop a wheelie
all my bitches pretty, tough as a diddy
if you ain't with the movement get your ass out the city
bitch really


bang my city, my city we bang
this ain't nothing but a long beach thing
all my homies they got my back
talk that smack and i'mma peel you back


yes, mind over matter grind over chatter
deck not full, call me mad hatter
jumped in the rabbit hole mission is the carrots
on my bullshit colonel strife with the merits
cut from the cloth of a boss i inherit
don't sleep i'm tied to these streets like a marriage
loyal on my ring finger love on my middle
faith on my index i need it when i scribble, uh
different bitch every day like i'm civil
but you would never catch him on a leash in my kenal
cola doesn't save him cola doesn't cape
cola feed him kibble real bitches relate
i am not a quitter nor will i ever equate
push my own line for the west of the state
scooped up the game laid it out on my plate
queen of the west this ain't up for debate

yeah, and you know long beach did it
but we ain't dropping name nigga this ain't no attendance
these niggas be in conversations talking about they business
but if you knew better you'd be talking about your dividends
i ain't got no friends, they be acting funny
it's cool in the beginning but if they ain't getting money
end it soon cause motherfuckers don't wanna see you boom
they don't want to give lots of credit where credit is due
i take them to school, but they don't show me no love
they just stalk my instagram and wait for me to hoe up
that'll be the day you niggas petty you forgetting
you used to be making investments into the future nigga, beach

bang my city, my city we bang
this ain't nothing but a long beach thing
all my homies they got my back
talk that smack and i'mma peel you back


i'm from north side long beach
know a couple niggas from the gang
but i ain't saying names cause that's dry snitching
you fucking with a cold killer when i start spitting
your mind vivid, i blind vision with my lyrics
we on a mission to get it, i'm concentrating on digits
can't pay attention to bitches, these niggas stay in they feelings
cause now they see i'm the realest
i'm going in i be killing shit, you feeling it?
long beach city bitch


n-a to the motherfucking e
yelling checkmate i be the queen of the beach
if the sky is the limit guess i'm looking like the clouds
only smoking if it's loud like you bitches run you down
trying to get mills so my fam can say grace
put my heart up in this shit, like i'm rapping to my pace
i'm at my post like a joker i'm no joke
smoke that shit that's at your neck like a rope
get it? you choke
niggas thirsty thumbing, i'm his puss-iera mist, ah
make that pussy nigga give me bills not talking rent
top put him to bead like the head on a pillow
married to the money
dead presidents got me looking like i'm widowed
