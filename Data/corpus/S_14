all i wanna do is make the whole crowd bounce y'all...


instructions to this game, it's instinct mixed with knowledge
i'm a player in the game and i know not from college
eyes open, focus, scoping out the scene
watch the gangsta haters close 'cause they worse than dope fiends
i hope things get better for you
cos i'm gon' make things get better for me
and keep the doggystyle hottest thing out the lb
the l-l-g wit dpg by the sea
we ride at high tide, the east is my side
let me tell you 'long as my voice is recordable
that plan you got ain't gonna work you better audible
oh yes i'm fresh 'til i expire from existence
with persistence, i proceed
supplying you with what you need, no room for greed
better go around and when it come to you
don't bite off more than you can chew
respect the game and the game will respect you back
game is life, life is struggle
without the coastal juggle
so if you drop i test that, fragile as a crystal
(will you get mad and go pull out your pistol?)
or will you be a man and pick up all the pieces
and put it back together and remain tougher than leather
as for me i'm tryin to keep it real dogg
