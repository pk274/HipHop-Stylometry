put your hands up come off them grams
i ain't trippin that's the way i am (the way i am)
and if you see me with heat in my hand
then you better duck that's the way i am (the way i am)

i can't believe ya got up in them pants
sexy lady gon do that dance
come on over when ya sick of ya man
and we can chill that's the way i am (the way i am)

i don't know that girl i just met her
sippin on sour amoretta
she gon do her thing a five letter
but imma bounce cause her friend looks better
i like the way she knows me
i like the way she got herself in v i p
if she sees k n o see
she gon chill
and wait out front for me
who do you know that rides for the coast
with a new breed and style of rap like me
i had the patience to study the game
dr dre made two chronics and this is chronic three
i make classic hits and buy classic cars
and see classic tits at classic bars
knoc steps in the spot and the girls all pause
magic stick ill break down walls
got my heat as shit jumps off
really you stepping to me is a lost cause
party animal here since a quarter to ten
baby phase 16 with an la brim
i got shell toes on i don't wear them tims
got niggas got hoes in the gaggle of gin
ain't no telling what i might get in
the first night
do it right
imma do it again
c'mon


you know where we be
in da club
come find me
i ain't trippin'
air is free so what ever you want to do
for real though
its just the way i am
