harlem nights, quick speed, godspeed
speed of light, grease lightnin', leather on my six-speed bike
bicycle tires, icicle diamonds, popsicle stripes
pop (sicles) pop (sicles) for the klondikes
pop-pop wheelies on the dirty bikes, 15 sellin' china white
cops stoppin' if you opposite of white
pop, pop like you opposite of right
take heed, lil' nigga, lowkey, take lead on them niggas
