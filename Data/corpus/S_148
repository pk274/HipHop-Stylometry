keep some killers by my side, do this shit worldwide


i’m a lover, and a fighter, gangsta and a rider
eastsider, a rip rider—but y’all knew that from the giddy
way cold, bold, stroll with control
and shuttin’ down shops around the muthafuckin’ globe
puttin’ dicks in yukmouths (biatch), watch these bitches fold
don’t speak on mine, cuz, unless you tryna get t-rolled
kee-kee-kee-keep it on, freak-freak-freak ya dome
stop, nah’mean, ya don’t quit, bitch
so many fuckin’ lawsuits and court cases
snitches and probation, look at what i’m facing
either you want me to give you some type of explanation
or sympathize—fuck that, cuz, i’m from the side
where we ride and the weak fall off and the snitches get clipped
and from me to you, loco, that’s just some real shit
i’ma sit back and get my hair braided
roll this dope and get faded, blaze it and blaze it—it’s so amazing
