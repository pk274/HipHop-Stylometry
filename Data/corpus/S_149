i came through in a zoot suit, pin stripe, lookin' too cute
tryin' to get my shoot on, so i'ma scoot on
over to the next bitch, say her name is texas (texas)
she fly, but she wasn't the sexiest
she had a ho with her named 'bama, short for alabama
a big bad mama jama, now look here
i like big bitches ('kay), 'cause they large (uh-huh, uh)
and big bitches always take charge
wanna grab a skinny nigga like snoop dogg
'cause you like it tall, go and work it, baby doll (baby doll)
now a great big girl got a hell of a grip to grab a hold of
got a lot of cash for a little love
all they wanna do is take you down to the mall
floss a little bit and get a t-shirt that say "ms. snoop dogg"
i don't see a goddamn thang
that's stoppin' you from buyin' me that goddamn ring
it'd look nice on my finger, i'ma buy you a zinger
'cause you make me feel like a real hip hop singer
your homegirl, bring her, 'cause i've been dyin' to meet her
you know i won't cheat her, don't mistreat her
she only get the dick, i'll never ever eat her
but i'll drop her ass, 'cause you know i don't need her
shit, it was fun while it lasted
you know what they say, "big things come in small packages, baby"


you thought you had my grip
but snoop dogg never ever slips
you thought you had my cash
until i turned around and whooped yo' ass
trick biatch


i said, biatch, what are you smokin'?
a big fat dick comin' from east oakland
there must be some kind of misunderstandin'
hit the parking lot, bitch, i'll be standin' by the benz
you think a nigga rich, bitch
gold diggin' tramps tryin' to get with this dick
for all the wrong reasons
niggas ain't trickin' durin' pimp season
but you still jumped your fast ass in anyway
if any other nigga picked you up, it'd be payday
i rolled to my house with the bitch
what'd you do, $hort? introduced her mouth to my dick ("how you doin'?")
glad to meet ya, make yourself comfortable
you fuckin' with a dog, bitch, you ain't finna come up, ho
so you might as well enjoy the ride
and serve this nigga from the eastside (eastside)
not much for the game that i'm sellin'
ain't no tellin' like jack told helen
i know sex sells, but i'ma tell you though
can't spend on shit that ain't valuable
fucked all night, woke up the next mornin'
told her, "i'm a pimp," but the bitch kept on
wantin' me to do somethin' for the time she spent (hahahaha)
it's funny, 'cause now she can't find the rent money


you thought you had my grip
but too $hort never ever slips
you thought you had my cash
until i turned around and whooped yo' ass
(check this out) trick biatch, biatch
