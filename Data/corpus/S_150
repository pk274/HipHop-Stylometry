just another day in my neighborhood

i'm swingin' my cuz, in a blue vein switchin' lanes
backseat full of goods, what it do huh?
baby suckin' on a blow pop
put your seatbelt on, let me make the fo' hop
i get out and crip walk on the block
left hand on my glock, 20 crip and it don't stop
yeah nigga, i can always tell a scared nigga
ol' loud-mouth busta-ass nigga wouldn't break a glass
now he wanna run up on me and mash
i catch him by himself, now he talkin' fast
"oh, snoop dogg, please don't blast!"
don't worry 'bout a motherfuckin' thang
but worry 'bout my homies 'cause my homies gon' bang on the game
