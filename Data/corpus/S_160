i'm from the murder side, long beach
certified rollin' 20 crip, you heard it right
boy (oh, god), no place you can hide
throwin' up the c, but got homies from the other side
boy (oh, god), i hooked up with more hogs
cube, 40 and short dog
representin' cali (oh, god), we back on it, boy
mount westmore, put a stamp on it, boy
we smack on you, boy (oh, god), blowin' smoke through the ozone (ah)
hit the block and get my roll on
money lookin' so long (oh, god), all my niggas on the same shit
pick one, you can't go wrong (yes, sir)
yeah, for sure, boy (oh, god), we do it, we sip the fluid
dippin' and movin', smokin' the best weed (ohh-whee)
dub-e-s-t (oh, god), just look to the left
live in the flesh, four niggas throwin' up the west


out of the dark alleys of californ-i-a
bow-wow-wow, yippy-yo, yippy-yay
where the gs play
home of the cougars and the falcons, oh, yeah, that's the bay
but out in la
we prefer the four, the deuce, or the trey
