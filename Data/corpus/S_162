get your ice, get your cups, 'cause we about to get fucked up in here
yea heard me (yah), straight up, uhm (uhm), yah (yah)


i'm still smokin, driftin, swifter than a motherfucker
twisted off a cup of that 'ole ignat juice
heater in the seater, cup fulla drank
beatin' up the block in the dark blue tank
bullet proof vest on my chest for the cause
dick in my draws for the motherfuckin' law
harrassin' a nigga, blastin' a nigga
i ain't seen shit, so why y'all askin' a nigga
i'm too fucked up off that g-i and juice
c-i get loose, nigga what y'all wanna do
i got a crew, but i choose to roll solo
especially on sundays dippin' in my low-low
convertible top spot for the glock
i ain't fuckin with the hen dog, so toss out the sauce hot
put my shit on three wheels for thrills
i hit a corner and make sure my drink don't spill, that's real


rollin down the street, with heat
drankin, trees, sittin on d's
top rolled back so i can feel the breeze
never slippin', i keep my eyes on my enemies
rollin down the street, with heat
drankin, trees, sittin' on d's
top rolled back so i can feel the breeze
never slippin', i keep my eyes on my enemies

she say she knows nino, bitch stop lying (know nino)
cup of that gin and juice, i blank a bitch out
then turn the bitch out, look here
ain't no need for you be wastin' my time
see i picked you up, now i'mma stick you up, and dick you up
and give you what you need
stay in, then bring you back down to reality
with that california weed, she seemed trouble at first
and then it got worse, cause now (stop)
i got my hand up and down her mini-skirt
twerkin' that shit while i'm ridin' up the highway
doin' it my way, the hella high way, the fly way
swervin' in another lane, tryin' to maintain
and baby girl steady takin dick to the brain
left no stain, cause she swallowed it up
then she wanted to take a puff
i said "look here bitch you done had enough" (hold up, hold up)


rollin down the street, with heat
drankin, trees, sittin' on d's
top rolled back so i can feel the breeze
never slippin', i keep my eyes on my enemies
rollin down the street, with heat
drankin, trees, sittin' on d's
top rolled back so i can feel the breeze
never slippin', i keep my eyes on my enemies

to cop something, pop something, ya heard me
where's serv-b, nigga well serve me
since you got that big bad ass dank
nigga you know i'm known for havin that big ass bank
tryin' to buy all your dope, cause you're a smoker
i'll find that indo weed even when i'm on the east coast
cause times gettin' hard on the boulevard
but i refuse to lose, buy a zip of that backyard (hell no)
lil' jimmy's sent me something, i need to cop something
i know you got something, nigga stop frontin'
get at your boy, hook it up like master p (ugh)
or would it be a tragedy, ya feel me, the best weed nigga


rollin down the street, with heat
drankin, trees, sittin' on d's
top rolled back so i can feel the breeze
never slippin', i keep my eyes on my enemies
