melissa brista in san francisca
the cute little sista with the feet for blista
say that i dissed her cause i wouldn't kiss her
but i got her a picture say i'll holla back witcha (i'll holla)
hey, they say that i'm like mr. bigsta
all these bullshit moves to miss us
divide in twisters we buy relistas
we mind my listnats cause i'm a mimsta
design by mimstas these time are senistas
but i'mma finish her on the ground until it's done
knives and silly clubs - hoes and fake thugs
pimps, players and all the above





(oooooh weeee)


oh, were was i? oh yes, spittin' to flip ya
comin' thru scriptures; straight your ditchas
pigs won't pinch us, won't just miss us
and they wanna french kiss us
pack the pistas, twist don't twist us
roll with me on this dog adventure
but you can't enter without your credentias
and if you get in, you might get a picture (come on)
so sit your shit down, go on and get down
it's huggy baby, it's comin' in your town
you don't wanna miss this, it's just like christmas
so make your wish list and go on and flicc this (preach)
