i sell a dream
i'm hella clean, this the life you wish fo'
i'm comfortable, you can bump the flow
brains blew out, it's convertible
white walls, plush seats
i'm a boss at all costs, i must eat
vintage statute, grinnin at you
gold ones, continue spinnin at you
i'm a heavyweight, look at how i levitate
and perpetuate the rate of the golden state
my cousin earl knew i'mma set it straight
and set a date and meditate and regulate
