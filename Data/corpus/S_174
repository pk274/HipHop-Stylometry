ladies
can i talk to y'all for a minute?
yes


you say i'm always high
we keep that on the low
flossy, it's a fun day on the runway, you can let it go


when i give my heart again, i know
it's gonna last forever
no one tell me where or when, i know
it's gonna last forever
when i fall in love again, i know
it's gonna last forever
(one) forеver, forever (two), forеver, forever
(three) forever, forever
it's gonna last forever (one, two, three, let's go!)


after the show we can kick it like tai chi
me and you in the mood, that's likely
get your dance on, baby, entice me
i'm in the cut, but you know where to find me


when i fall in love again, i know
it's gonna last forever
(one) forever, forever (two), forever, forever
(three) forever, forever
it's gonna last forever (one, two, three, let's go!)


yes, yes
yes, yes, yes, yes
woah-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh (yeah)
(one, two, three, let's go!)
