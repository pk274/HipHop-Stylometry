they throw the rock, hide they hand and wait for you to trip
then show the worst on the news, "look y'all, he was a crip"
now what am i supposed to do when family's on the line?
and how am i to stay calm with that still on my mind?
bodies droppin' by the dozens
the people sworn to protect is killin' all my cousins
for that, i keep my head on a swivel, dogg's out the kennel
don't you want revenge just a little? shit
what do you tell a mother in pain who lost a child
by the hands of the people she called?
for a situation across the street
when all he did was walk over to keep the peace? cold game
now she gotta live with seein' that whole thing
nobody got charged for the murder - more pain
they wonder why we out here trippin'
the least of your worries should be me and my crippin', nigga
