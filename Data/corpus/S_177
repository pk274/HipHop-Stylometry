what will i do, what can i say
i pray today is the day
if i can change the world, i'd probably rush your problems away
find cures for diseases, increasing the peace
and bring the word to the people right here in the streets
so they can fill up their hearts with love, joy, no stressin'
you can hear it, it's the spirit
yes i'm blessed, oh yes
see he's my lord and savior
that's probably why i'm blessed and highly favored

what can i do
