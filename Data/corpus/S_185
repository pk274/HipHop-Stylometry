bad mothafucka with a set of gators on my feet
catalytic drippin' wet, color of that picture peach
mink coat on my back like a cat
black panther, as serious as cancers
ridin' like a dancer, answer the question
suggestion, i'm pressin' the issue
soft as a tissue, miss you, miss me?
baby, wanna kiss me, but we gettin' bubbly
dippin' and duckin', bobbin' and weavin'
achievin' my dream and cold and
about your bitch; she fien and schemin'
she wanna be down, wanna be 'round
need the cost to be the boss, she in the lost and frown
and now that she sees the light, i pimp like
fillmore slim with a dap of dynamite, aight?
you know how they hoes gonna be, they on me
muthafucka, ya bitch chose me
