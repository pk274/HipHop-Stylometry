many people don't be knowin' about this pimp game (pimp game)
but i'm sure they wanna know about this pimp game (pimp game)
and to me, you know it ain't no motherfuckin' thang
to give it to you plain and simple 'cause you know it's played
holla at 'em, doggy dogg, go and do that thang
okay, "sa da tay" like my nigga pootie tang
i got that bounce, to make her booty sway
that little cutie thang, 'fred, she's a beauty, mayne' (ooh wee)


rollin' with a player 'cause that's what he was
and dedicated to his paper, je-sus!
on his bitches hard as feezuck
and if them law boys pull him over he won't freeze up
he got the heata-fa-heata and the keysa
with a pocket full of big faced visas
they say it's cheaper to keep her, now baby, ease up
kick back and blaze some of these trees up
now sit your ass in the treezuck
and do me a favor and turn the music up
should i slap her, or should i freak her?
i'll take the stronger, you can have the weaker
speak when spoken to, yeah, i broke a few
and by the way i was hoping you
had a freak for me and a freak for you
i make 'em do for us
that thang you been wantin' her to do for months

that little cutie thang, 'fred, she's a beauty, mayne' (ooh wee)


i had three on my right arm and four on my left
lime green and gold, we was sharp to death (ooh wee)
had to catch my breath, watch my step
playin' this game, you can holla at the ref
and call a timeout before you put your dime out
stop, pause, rewind before you put your rhyme out
and go to the "wizard of oz"
and tell 'em that your tryin' to get yourself a brand new heart
a brand new start
'cause you realized that you hadn't played your part
and that was smart
it's like a art the way i articulate
and break these bitches from state to state
see, i've been the flyest since i came out the gate
i ain't ask for it, homie, i just shake and bake
i won't fake to make you buy my tape
i say a prayer to the lord just to keep my faith up straight
