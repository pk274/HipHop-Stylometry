ten little crip niggas runnin' outside
all from the turf and they bangin' out lives
far from a scrub cuzz from the eastside
where they don't die they just multiply
so.. don't give them niggas a reason
to turn it into spray season
don't give them niggas a reason
because they'll turn it into crip season


the gangsta's back, the bank is fat
the gangsta mac, in a gangsta 'llac
hmm.. fools be like, "break off some cheese"
friends and enemies, aww nigga please
fuck, you thought who pumped you up
stop, you stuck too much, pop, drop, you plucked
it's all similar to gettin laid
on ya back when the motherfuckin' k sprays
i grind for my shine about my bidness
lunatic on the shit and i get ignit (ignit)
gonna proceed to squeeze with ease
one of these, they can't believe how i leave 'em
look into a mind of a nigga that's crazy
seventeen years old and still a baby
gangstas real, they pop the pill
you cap back, young motherfucker it's like that

fuck a honey dip.. cause i got money to get
ain't no books, ain't no help, ain't no role to this
stay focused young homey, that's the code to this
keep a strap in ya pocket when you trip through the towns
there's a million motherfuckers tryna get you down
a lot of pain in this game, cocaine is the thang
if ya money right then you might get you a chain
but if ya money is low, there's only one way to go
jack a rapper at a local rap radio show
so mean, so green, crip back to the block
then brag to the homies, show 'em what you got

and they thought we just gangsta rapped
yeah nigga, we take your snaps
your shooby dooby, hooroobies, and your scooby snacks (it's like that?)
