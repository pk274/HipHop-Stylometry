girl, as i sit here thinkin' to myself
there is no one for you but me and i mean that
and i think about all the things we been through
like arguin' and fightin', for example
you know, the love we have for each other
it tends to outweigh what we do to one another
you know, my granddaddy used to always say
you know, he used to sing it like this


there will be ups and downs, smiles and frowns
share with me, fairy tales are make-believe
there will be ups and downs, smiles and frowns
share with me, fairy tales are make-believe
there will be ups and downs, smiles and frowns
share with me, fairy tales are make-believe


what up, motherfuckers? this is snoop dogg
i'm tryin' to figure out how the fuck i'ma do y'all
hangin' with my homie from the turf, that's young q-ball
givin' me the word on the streets, here's the scoop, y'all
the niggas from tha eastsidaz split up (split up)
and one of 'em tried to fuck your shit up (what?)
nah cuz, don't believe that, that's my nigga for life
i'm out with the bullshit, i'm in with the real shit
i'm at the church doing work, spittin' game from the pulpit
now that's the business, and god as my witness
lbc, 213, hell yeah, we in this
it's so relentless and all my dogs up against the life sentence
i love y'all like i love no bitch and that's real shit
on some crip shit, homie, dig this


there will be ups and downs, smiles and frowns
share with me, fairy tales are make-believe
there will be ups and downs, smiles and frowns
share with me, fairy tales are make-believe


i used to have a lot of broads that i don't fool with
i used to have a lot of homeboys i ain't cool with
a lot of people that a nigga went to school with
happy as hell to see the big dog doin' it
but wouldn't none of them believe it though (what?)
that i would be bigger than kurtis blow
i guess he was right, these are the breaks
despite my mistakes and aches, i'm getting cake
to realize your fate through faith
'cause we all gon' get that day (for what?)
to see if our life was straight
and see if we'll be able to walk through the pearly gates (yeah?)
to see the man upstairs
on some real talk, homie, i'm tired of bein' stuck here
if i could, i would fly to the moon (zoom)
y'all probably think i'm trippin' off these mushrooms, i know


there will be ups and downs, smiles and frowns
share with me, fairy tales are make-believe
there will be ups and downs, smiles and frowns
share with me, fairy tales are make-believe
there will be ups and downs, smiles and frowns
share with me, fairy tales are make-believe
there will be ups and downs, smiles and frowns
share with me, fairy tales are make-believe


now, as i think back to the words my granddaddy used to say
i never seen him in church, but he always had the word
he always would tell me, "sometimes you gotta take the good with the bad
you got to do bad in order to do good"
