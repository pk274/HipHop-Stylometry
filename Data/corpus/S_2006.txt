let's get this party jumpin', me and kel' gon' get it bumpin'
they humpin' like when it's over, we gon' all get into somethin'
the dogg is fresh, southside without a vest
nothin on my chest but these ladies up out the midwest
i must confess that in the chi' you're so blessed
leaving nothing on my mind but doggy, you and safe sex
this ain't a test, you fucking with a cold mess
meet me in chicago, let me hip you to this real west
it's real strong, real fat and real long
doggies in the building, holdin' something they can feel up on
and once they get it something they can build up on
take that skinny nigga home, work that filling till it's gone
get that home grown, put that shit on daddy long
i know how you ladies do it, t-shirt with no panties on
let's get this shit crackin', kell and doggy dogg in action
if you in here all alone, you might get this dog bone


dippin' low, '64, hundred spokes and chronic smoke
all these ladies on the floor cause they know what we in here for
dogg and kelly came to ball, get your ass up off the wall
let that middle wiggle now make that shit fall
not just one but all y'all, move it like you want it all
let me see you bounce it for me, work that shit for doggy dogg
you gots to do it, is that your crew?
bring 'em too, come here let me take you through it
then once kelly get into it, we can get this after party
poppin' everybody, got themselves another body
knockin' out without protection though, that's my confession
but at the spot if you just think you want a lesson, you can drop it like it's hot
hold up, i came to cool out, lay back and get blown
maybe henny, maybe gin, a couple shots of patron
and if you didn't you missed it but now it's known
that this that shit, kels sing that song, come on
