yes and we're back here at the jack-off hour
187.4 on your fm dial, i am willie dynamite and we're getting ready for another quarantine kick-off hour
we got the d-o-double-g here, yeah that's right, we got snoop dogg in the house (ha-ha)
speakin' of house, streetlights on, nigga get yo' ass in, and stay there
i wanna go outside, but i'm stuck in the house (in the house)
i wanna take a ride, but i'm sittin' right on the couch (woah-ooh)


you can't tell me this is how we supposed to be livin' (no, no)
i'm just waitin' for the day i can have some fun (fun)
too much time on my hands, my whole world is spinnin' (turn around)
i just want to have a good time in the sky


i'd rather be out there in the streets
in my hood, in the beach, feelin' good
reppin' that eastside lbc (that's what i'm talkin' 'bout)
usually, i would be out there in the club
vip, bangin' the dub, fresh and clean
reppin' that eastside lbc (that's what i'm talkin' 'bout)


i got the rhythm it takes to dance through what we have to live through (they say don't go outside, it ain't safe to play, baby)
i'm in my house just chillin'
here's my chance to dance my way, out of my constriction


movin' in the mirror, while listenin' to some oldies
cookin' in the kitchen, madden with the homies
release a little tension, dinner with the family (i'm in my house just chillin')
and you know it ain't nothin' wrong with spendin' a little quality time, baby (ooh-ooh)

yeah, you got that right
choose my battles wisely, ain't gon' fight that fight
all my family and friends, i just want 'em to live
happy times and good health, old to the young
times gon' get better, i know it's slow to come
i couldn't hold my tongue (i got a little message for you)
we gon' take our time, ain't no need to rush, we'll be back in the sun (wanna get out in the sunshine, ooh-woah)
