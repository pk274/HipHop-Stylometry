lock n load rock n roll sock em up n watch em fold
20 homies 2 minutes gangbang overload
wanna be a gangsta well this the first step
choose who you wanna cruise with, that's your birth set
now get you some heat and learn to merk back
no rats and cat naps where you work at, for real
my family, they chose the shield
but me, i'm a dub with the pittsburgh steel

gangstas, ridas and we get busy
and swang them thangs like we slanging a frisbee
pop a few shots where your moms and kids be
patch on my eye like spuds mckenzie
strike up on the wall where your homies and friends be
long beach nigga we the all crip ci-ty
