make snoop dogg
and i'm chilling
with a feelin'
drink spilling
'bout a million
yeah we really getting a billy
chronic getting sky
make it mine
vi, pi
mp behind the clouds
that's where you find me
dress code, pimp mode
four hoes and three blunts
sipping on some tanqueray
modern day marvin gaye
my aroma is off a stoner
i leave your body stuck up in a coma
yeah i'm home!
