yo what's happening?
what you crying for?
now u know u look 2 damn good 2 be cryin...
come here... holla at a playa
dpg style... ya know... ya know...


late at night like a little child
wandering around alone in my new friend's home (all alone)
(dry your eyes, dry your eyes)
on my tippy toes
so that he won't know
(so that he won't know)
i still cry baby (i cry baby)
over you and me
(baby don't cry)


sipping bailey's cream
by the stereo (yeah)
trying to find relief
on the radio (ah, what's up)
i'm suppressing the tears
but they start to flow
'cause the next song i hear
is a song i wrote
when we first got together
early that september
i can't bear to listen
so i might as well drift
in the kitchen
pour another glass or two
and try to forget you
(ya know... ya know...)


late at night like a little child
wandering around alone in my new friend's home
(wandering around... in my new friend's home on my my...)
on my tippy toes (tippy toes)
(baby don't cry)
so that he won't know (so that he won't know i...)
i still cry baby (cry over you)
over you and me
(baby don't cry)

baby hear me when i say
let that man be on his way
don't even waste your time
and worry 'bout how he handle things (that ain't right)
baby hear me when i say
a playa feeling good today
(you know you're too fly to be cryin')
don't even waste your time
watch how i handle things
man you's a fool for this
for this
but on the real dog i'm cool with this
we doin' this
d-o double g z-y
kiss the girls and make them cry

wandering around alone in my new friend's home (wandering around alone... do do do do doo)

on my tippy toes

i still cry baby (i'm up spiraling over you and me)
over you and me

late at night like a little child
(that ain't right)
wandering around alone in my new friend's home (and walking around alone... do do do do doo)
(you know you too fly to be crying)
on my tippy toes (on my tippy toes)
so that he won't know (so that he won't know)
