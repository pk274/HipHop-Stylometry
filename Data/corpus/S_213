yo k, bee boo boppin' party
i guess you would say i'm dr. bombay
tryin' to find some peace of mind
what spots my eye, a cutie pie
my time is yours if you want it
we can get loose, get right, or get blunted
we'll be kickin' it, diggin' it, body on make me soo iganet
i wanna ball with you, but i'll have you back home by tomorrow boo
eloquent, delicate, you the subject, i'm your predicate
bet it is, set it is, i wanna see how i please you
freak by nature, do what i did to amaze you
phoneless, domeless, glacier
non-argumentative, you lookin' at the dogg so i know i'mma get it
time over video, rhyme with a skill, on time what a deal
i'm smokin' up some weed, just me and my cutie pie
this is the melody, one way one day let it be, just you and me
cutie pie
