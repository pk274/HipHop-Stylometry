now i told you one and i told you twice
this is my motherfucking life
sly, working at the dmv
bitch who are you? tmz?
i can’t breathe with you on my neck
better get a hold or the team on deck
call me, complaining, draining a nigga
with this raining, for the maintain
i left out the back door
and met lil’ mama on the down low
and i slid to the restroom
and found out you was next door
cheating in the next room
who am i to play?’
and what am i to say?
fading away like a dj
really don’t give a fuck bout what she say

it’s just not none of your business (not none of your business, bitch)
not much difference (not much difference)

round and round we go
where we’ll stop, nobody knows
guess i must have forget you see me creeping out the door
and i say i’m never coming back
she got the nerve to ask me why
guess she tried to play me
i ain’t crazy
look here baby

it’s not a secret (it’s not a secret)
it’s just not none of your business (it’s just not none of your business, bitch)

crazy friends go coo-coo for the cocoa puffs
smoking on that kush, she got fucked up
hitting my followers, stalking on my females
crazy bitch be lying all about our details
fake pics that ain’t you, damn she worsen
tryna fuck again but bitch i ain’t nervous
what’s mine is mine, find out you want
the conversation, kick bitch, you just word
you ain’t learned your lesson
second guessing your homie
you like a dog, bitch, go on, get, fetch
tryna trap a nigga using a phony tag name

you ain’t much different
you similar like always
the type of bitch you are
see them bitches all day
