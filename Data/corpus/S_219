awww nah, big snoop dogg
slap you with my paw, all across your jaw
break fool on these bitches while i'm breakin' the law
you come up in my room look bitch you takin' it off
follow me, i slip em slide em rip em ride em provide em
with that west coast g shit, l.b.c. shit
we dips to this, make chips to this
and buy brand new whips and shit, uh-huh (beyotch)
i bet you didn't know that yo' bitch was suckin' dick (say what?)
who you think she fuckin' with? (what?) look here
my, eastside lifestyle is way foul, move the crowd
point a pistol at you bitch niggas, bla-dow
...how you like me now? (what, what, what?)
you got stuck and fucked, doggystyle
100 spokes day-tonas, bendin' the corner
all up in crooklyn, bad bitches are lookin'
