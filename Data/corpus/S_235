ayy, man
you know they got it out for niggas like us, you know what i'm sayin'?
since you doin' your thing then you should like put me on, you feel me?
man, you know i've been tryna get my money right
nigga, hol' on


i can't get no paper with you 'til you get your mind right
can't have your dark cloud dim, dimmin' my light
can't get no paper with you 'til you get your mind right
can't have your dark cloud dim, dimmin' my light


can't get no money with you 'til you get your mind right
them demons that's holdin' you back still in your eyesight
forever slackin' dirty mackin' just to get some limelight
whatever captain, we'll make it happen whenever time's right
see me movin' and shakin' and playin'  with hustlers that's hustlin'
crossin' their t's and dottin' their i's and us
hard workers with purpose gon' spot a clown in the circus
no matter makeup, jewelry, clout, can't disguise


i can't get no paper with you 'til you get your mind right
can't have your dark cloud dim, dimmin' my light
can't get no paper with you 'til you get your mind right
can't have your dark cloud dim, dimmin' my light


i can't get no paper with you 'til you get your mind right
can't have your dark cloud dim, dimmin' my light
can't get no paper with you 'til you get your mind right
can't have your dark cloud dim, dimmin' my light
