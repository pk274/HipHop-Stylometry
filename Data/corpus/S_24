whenever i'm down and out i get back to myself
i roll a motherfucking fat bat to myself
leave it to beaver, america gon' legalize but i ain't believe her
til she finally did it
overworked but i'm still committed
all things under the letter g, snoop dogg done did it
gracefully gazing unto the sky
a lot of people smoke just to get by
but i see things much differently
medically, physically, mentally, theoretically
put it in a letter so you let it be
one day we'll all agree and have peace up under a big chronic tree
if i had my way at 4:20 every day you could blaze a j
and not have to answer to nobody
i live my life like it's a party
so let's go cuz


so go ahead and blaze up
today's the day to blaze up (yeah, yeah ooh)
so go ahead and put your j's up (and smoke)
na-na-na-na-na-nanana (get high)
na-na-na-na-na-nananana


so go ahead and blaze up
today's the day to blaze up (yeah, yeah ooh)
so go ahead and put your j's up (and smoke)
na-na-na-na-na-nanana (get high)
na-na-na-na-na-nanana


so go ahead and blaze up
today's the day to blaze up (yeah, yeah ooh)
so go ahead and put your j's up (and smoke)
na-na-na-na-na-nanana (get high)
na-na-na-na-na-nanana
go ahead and blaze up
today's the day to blaze up
so go ahead and put your j's up
na-na-na-na-na-nanana
