valifornia, raven felix
bitch, snoop dogg
what time is it?


don't watch the clock, watch the moves i make
the cake i bake, steak to steak, the rules i break
realistically, you in the midst of me
what you want and what you are and what's your fantasy?
party people in the place to be
i see that she and y’all do agree with me
and we will be, raven be the she with me
ain’t nothing puffing like chief and g
the key to me, the pimp-hop philosophy
listen how my words slide right on beat
walk your dog like fido beat
left hind leg up, now pee on the tree
oh yeah, we killing them loc
we the bombest, i’m honest and iller than most
west coast motherfucker, ‘til the sun burnt up
it’s five in the morning, we still turnt up
