meditate to my flow, as i mob down the row
yo, boy is it loony where the grass is greener
187 ain't shit but a misdemeanor
i've seen a lot of niggas come up, a few niggas done up
some rest in peace with their khakis heavy creased
but it's an eastside thang, a who-ride thang
if we bang to the boogie, then we boogie to the bang
i bring you the muthafuckin' .38
just get the mc and my homie nate
so we can ride, slide, slippety slide
as i take you on a trip, nigga, ride, eastside
