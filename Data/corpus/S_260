it's like everywhere i look, and everywhere i go
i'm hearin' motherfuckers tryna steal my flow
but it ain't no thang, 'cause, see, my nigga coolio
put me up on the game when i stepped through the do'


you know, some of these niggas is so deceptive
usin' my styles like a contraceptive
i hope you get burnt, seems you haven't learnt
it's the knick-knack, paddywhack, i still got the biggest sack
so put your gun away, run away, 'cause i'm back (why?)
hit 'em up, get 'em up, spit 'em up
now, tell me, what's going on?
it make me wanna holler, 'cause my dollars come in o-zones
known for the break up, so take off your clothes
and quit tryna spit at my motherfuckin' hoes
speakin' of hoes, i'll get to the point
you think you got the bomb 'cause i rolled you a joint?
you'se a flea, and i'm the big dogg
i'll scratch you off my balls with my motherfuckin' paws
y'alls niggas better recognize (uh-huh)
and see where i'm comin' from â€” it's still eastside 'til i die
why ask why?
as the world keeps spinnin' to the d-o-double g, y
