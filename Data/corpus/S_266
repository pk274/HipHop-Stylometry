flyin' in on a falcon or a hawk
i'm in the a makin' plays it's the big boss
keep the ball on the grass or get picked off
walk around on my grounds you can get lost have a seat
let me show you what this shit do
good game good thangs here to get you
hit you up no cup just bottles to the face
a little drip from a crip in and out of state
bake cake with the southerners
drop a tape with drama and all the bad bitches start showin' up
slowin' up just to get you caught up with the product
drippin' like water while i'm flippin' your dolla
