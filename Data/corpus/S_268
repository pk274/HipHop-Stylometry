you know my story
i did a lot of balling
been around the world
a lot of girls calling
a lot of panties falling
out the air and on the stage
if my life was a book
you wouldn't miss a page
but none of that really matters
when i cut my eyes and roll
seen her pass by
i damn near dropped my folds
i'm like snoopy breathe
kush had me gone
i couldn't think straight
pimpin' was all alone
shoulda seen her walking
like a model do
if this was twitter
i would follow you
open your world to new things
let doggy take your hand
i'm seeing wedding rings
call diddy lets make a band
she got me hot
i don't want to leave
i seen the world's best
but she's something to see
and now i'm on a plane
feeling so ashamed
i couldn't catch her name
i call her miss everything


tell me have you seen her (seen her)
five something, pretty face, and them big brown eyes
small little waist
when the floor goes tremble
make a grown man cry
oooh
i keep runnin' the tune at her
but the numbers never got exchanged
every town, every city
got a, a miss everything
miss everything (miss everything)


you know my story
i rocked a lot of crowds
sold millions of records
i love my fans so loud
i got a thousand cars
and all hopes of bein'
a real superstar
i live super far
but none of that really matters
when i caught my eyes in spain
she walked into me
like you did your thing
in that spanish accent
the one i love so much
she looked like an angel
one i wanted to touch
i blinked my eye for a second
and then she disappeared
when i see that pretty woman
i felt like richard gere
boss dog ain't never been one to watch it pass
unless we in they room, and they leave
and i watch that ass
but baby something else
somehow i didn't speak
i been a player so long
maybe i reached my peak
and now i'm on a plane
feeling so ashamed
i didn't catch her name
so i call her miss everything




yah, you know my story
i seen a lot of hoes
a lot of gold diggers
luda call them pros
i don't call them back
and thats just how it goes
most people call me snoopy
or s-n-double-o
but none of that really matters
when i was in new york
i had a show at the garden
you know, poppin' corks
that's when i seen her
from a distance
she smiled and froze
now everything i learned in the game
told me she chose
and i don't miss a beat
this time i gotta speak
she looked magnificent
like something to eat
hey co, i can't let her go
i made my way through the crowd
let's get out of here
head to filipe childs
lotta stars in place
doggy set the mood
i'm like "i like your style"
she's like "i like yours too"
before i hit this plane
i gotta know your name
she smiled as if she came
call me miss everything
