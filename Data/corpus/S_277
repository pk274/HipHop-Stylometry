i get money, i'm a hustler
so if you buyin' what i'm sellinâ€™, you a customer
see i can get it to you anywhere, anything
but it's point-blank range when the pistol bang
i mix it up, i fix it up and i switched it up
i locked down this end and got it twisted up
see i'm a dog, but i loc with my locs
they say, "you are what you smoke"

i thank the lord i ain't a broke nigga
i mix it up, i fix it up and i switched it up
