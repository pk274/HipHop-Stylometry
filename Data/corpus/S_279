i'm back up in the vip, in a cloud of smoke
be poundin', surrounded by all my folks
give me another shot, damn the music loud
i'm bout to mix it up and blend in in the crowd
whip, slip, slide by the dance floor
baby grab me by the hand say she wanna dance, oh oh
is that your girlfriend peepin' me out?
sho' nuff, it must be cause now she freakin' me out
she get behind a nigga, grindin' on a nigga, touchin' on me
whisperin' in my ear, damn it sound lovely
i'm infatuated, we evacuated, now we at the crib
it's two for the money, that's the life i live
kiss me, kiss her, now kiss each other
it's a trip the way i make these chicks twist each other
take your shirt off, now i'ma take hers off too
it's double or nothin', baby, that's how the boss do
