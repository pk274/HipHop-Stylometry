say it, blaire
say it, say it, blaire
what it is?
oh, it ain't nothin'
you know me
stickin' to the script, baby


1975, turnt out from watching this mac flame
all of my homies outside and they turning some backflips
running, playing hide, go seek, freeze-tagging all them games
i'm in the house putting together, this a masterclass
it's hard to explain that
but long as i'm on point, i know you gon' bang that
remain that, i need my thing back
you see, i came back the same cat, in the same lap, yeah
i aspire to be
politicians and teachers, they all lies to me
i see mink coats, bad hoes, long cash
my future is lookin' bright
i'm a hustler by day, but i'm a gangster at night
yeah, my vision with vision, see, my attention to witness
took advantage of ross, climbin' 'round the rug, movin' chickens
easy pickings, ain't no dickin' involved
get my money every day, baby, stay on the walls
they want to stay on the wall, they lowin', make me a call
young puppet, dogg, now, baby, go and get involved
more money, more problems, well, problem solved
you got to double me up, like i was paul rezar
