yeah
big snoop d-o-double g
kem, take 'em downtown
oh, oh
oh, oh
hey, hey, yeah


drank in my cup, pound in the cloud
which way is up, we headed downtown
posterior in area not to interfere-ior
but to jump outta bed with the merrier
clear-ior ya stereo bump, red dress with the pumps
baby girl, you got that good stuff
that i, been wantin' to get next to
you, you, you, you got a attitude
loved by everybody and everyone
you might be that very one
with wings of an angel
on the scene, we lean and do the tango
we dip, slip, slide, spin away
see we can go everywhere, any day
just name it, picture and frame it
lifestyles of the rich and the famous
