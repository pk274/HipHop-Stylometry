when the pimp's in the crib, ma
drop it like it's hot, drop it like it's hot, drop it like it's hot
when the pigs try to get at you
park it like it's hot, park it like it's hot, park it like it's hot
and if a nigga get a attitude
pop it like it's hot, pop it like it's hot, pop it like it's hot
i got the rolly on my arm, and i'm pourin' chandon
and i roll the best weed ‘cause i got it goin' on

i'm a gangsta, but y'all knew that
da big boss dogg, yeah i had to do that
i keep a blue flag hangin' out my backside
but only on the left side, yeah, that's the crip side
ain't no other way to play the game the way i play
i cut so much you thought i was a dj
"two, one, yep, three!"
s-n double o-p, d-o double g
i can't fake it, just break it, and when i take it
see, i specialize in makin' all the girls get naked
so bring your friends, all of y'all come inside
we got a world premiere right here, now get live!
so don't change the dizzle, turn it up a little
i got a livin' room full of fine dime brizzles
waitin' on the pizzle, the dizzle and the chizzle
g's to the bizzack—now, ladies, here we gizzo!
