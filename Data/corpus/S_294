fireworks when i spark, yellow tape
lotta chalk thought you said you a boss
big deal, bitch chill, pulling out that black card
showin’ off big spendin’, letting alcohol spill
i feel she might just get too faded
x-rated that's what i like glad that you made it
to this ceremony at hand, take a sip lets plan
for the future, introduce you to snoop get you right and
may i, kick a little something for the g's and
make a few ends as i breeze through?
the shit on my hip is a fucking preview
and guess what it lead to
