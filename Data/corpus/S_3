lay low, hold your gat and watch yourself
stay composed
my free throws roll dope and fold
motherfuckers
who be loving to clock that shit up
all they wanna do is show another nigga lit up
hit up names of the homies who rest in peace
you got the stars on with yo flag and yo khakis properly creased
mobbing up the fight
or should i say: "rollin' through the park one day"
sippin' on the indo
bad then a motherfucker
cops raid my house
shot my baby brother
they think he was strapped, but they never found the strap
my brother is gone, but the punk cop is back
servin' around the neighborhood constantly jackin'
young niggas is flippin' and trippin', foo but i'm packin'
stacking' g's, now i'm on the comeback spree
but i need to gеt the motherfucker down with mе
(yeah) so that's what i did, g
got my homie dr. dre and my girl r-a-g-e
now, the community is shocked
cause of a one-eight-seven on a punkass cop
