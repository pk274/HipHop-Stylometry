make the call, 9-1-1
it's going down, pop the gun
lots of fun, da da di
sa ra pi, d.o. double g
in the place, turn up the bass
in your face
anesthetics, call the paramedics
you know why?


baby girl, give it up
party all night til you can't get up
do your stuff, i'mma huff and puff
and give it to ya til you can't get enough
emergency, urgency
we don't stop, we don't sleep
and while you're watching the clock
9-1-1, better call the cops
like that there?
rewind the song, cause i'm out of here
