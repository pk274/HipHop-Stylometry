i'm sorry to keep you waitin' 'cause i've been cultivatin'
thuggish through my duration
doin' public relations
countin' money, doin' tv shows
i can't believe he goes underground then mainstream
super supreme and the cream rules everything (yup)
you fools do a lot of talkin' but you never swing
and that's on everything
see, i'm a king so i look upon my scruples
and then pinpoint which one will be my next pupil
concentrated, it's levels and layers
devils and players, joker's wild
while i'm strokin' her down, we'll be smokin' a pound
and we came to par-tay, three the hard way
johnny blaze, snoop dogg and my nephew
you can't smoke with us, nigga, we left you
in the dust (what?), on the bus (what?) homie, we don't give a fuck (what?)
long beach, nigga, east side
