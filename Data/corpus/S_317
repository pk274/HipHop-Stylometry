a cup of liquor with some swishas, i'm so sweet
this shit i'm blowin' make bo peep move four feet
og, sprinkle keif leaf on mine
this watermelon make you wanna eat the rind
east of vine, sunset boulevard
roll it up, take a hit, but don't pull it too hard
i seen a lot of fools ball out
they try and join the snoop dogg smoke session, then fall out
i spent a million on bud in 1992
and now i get it for free, like i'm supposed to
chose my venda', open my winda'
pull some kush lit out with hash, in the blunt and i blend them
rewind cha', remain, and rememba'
cause i'm choppin' and droppin' trees, screamin' out timber!
advocate, always push dro
one of the reasons my face is on mount kushmore
and you wanna know how i feel?
