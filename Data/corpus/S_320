you brainwashed not to know you grew up wanting to be a pimp, you wanted to be a player (right) you know, you grew up wanting to be these different things that are role models to you in your neighborhood, until you figure out that...hold on...i'm finna be the first role model that ain't that (right)


and there ain't no doubt about it
regarded as the freshest, by the way that i live
all the songs that i did, and givin' back to the kids
i mean i done been everywhere that you wanna go
and poppin' on a stick like a pogo
my logo, is similar to the bat sign
way up in the sky, when you wanna get high
now look up, now look up, i shook up the game
with the versatility, verbability, toungetwistagility
hell yeah, they love the dog
grandmomma's worldwide wanna hug the dog


the way i feel about snoop
the way i feel about snoop
the way i feel about snoop
the way i feel about snoop
the way i feel about snoop
the way i feel about snoop
the way i feel about snoop


look i'm back at it, melodramatic
a little more dope for you snoop dogg addicts
addicted to the things i do, magic
go go go but no gadget, i'm magic
if i wasn't invented
then you probably wouldn't even know how to represent it
i'm in it like i spread it, if i said it, all gas unleaded
for really though, i get that real hood love everywhere i go
from mommas, babies, grannies
you gotta love him even if you can't stand him


the way i feel about snoop
the way i feel about snoop
the way i feel about snoop
the way i feel about snoop
the way i feel about snoop
the way i feel about snoop
the way i feel about snoop
