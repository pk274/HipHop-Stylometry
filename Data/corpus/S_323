og,  s-n-double o-p
money talk, nigga, bullshit walk
'fore  a nigga show up, gotta envelope me
big dog, you could never short me (what?)
i need it all upfront, no backend
since a lil' nigga, dogg got it crackin'
on  deck all times, no lacking
head on swivel 'cause anything can happen
i was banging before i was rapping (rapping)
i was slanging before it was trapping (trapping)
always on go, it's automatic
gold medal caught my eye, i gotta have it
we lost nip too soon, that's tragic
but he gave la more wins than magic
more wins than kobe and shaq did
champions never die, they everlasting


i'm a boss, i'm a genius, i can't turn it off
a lot of niggas not caught from this cloth
you are witnessing a gangster evolve
after all the run-ins with the law (what?)
after life threw me all them curveballs (curveballs)
you'da thought i gave up, but nah (nah)
grow man, thug it out, stand tall
who sold millions of records and balled?
never slowed up, no no, not at all
from the streets of long beach, it's the dogg
i hustled every day, how you think i got it all?
did it my way, i done broke a lot of laws
always came in first place, i ain't never tied with y'all
everything real, i ain't never lied to y'all
first place (first place)
