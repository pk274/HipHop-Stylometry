know my name, know my game
everywhere, it's all the same
babygirl is a fan, doggy dogg is the man
gold rings and videos follow me in every city we go
i don't know what it is
it's crazy maybe, the life i live
doggy dog, he bouncin' ball
he break 'em all, he never take a fall
you can tell how i bale, and everything i touch will sell
clientele is what i got
you are cold and i am not
i am hip and i am pop
i'm cool and i'm hot
