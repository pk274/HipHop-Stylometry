now, when i fall up in the joint, i mean, the hoes be screamin'
'cause all of 'em wanna be down with the king, and
i'm overcrowded, you see what i'm meanin'?
but come back tonight and you might get the penis
bring sabrina, gina, and katrina
just a few racks, that reminds me of lavina
i keep a closet full of carpet cleaners
bad little bitches, misdemeanors (yeah)
lay back and kick them shoes off softly (yeah)
freaky little freak, i gotta get you up off me
you wanna do it all night? you want coffee?
you must be, i got you callin' me papi
i beat the pussy 'til it's wet and it's sloppy
i ain't no motherfuckin' carbon copy (no)
i'm the one, the only, the d-o-dub
i'll have you suckin' dick all in the club
you say you love me, well, prove it to a pimp, bitch
suck cuz, fuck him, then bring me the chips
pimpin', yeah, this pimpin'
breakin' these hoes with a whole new mission
