i take it to the face, inhale it through my nose
blowin with the homies on the low, man fuck these hoes
and crack-a-lac, pin it back
what you call a mack who crack a mad bitch like that?
a cracker jack
im like a florist, tourin like a tourist
godzilla flyin on a pegasorous
niggas know about it, even fore i pull it out
i put some fire on it, n now they beggin me to put it out
im in the hallway, rollin on the purple psyche
i know the in's and out's so i'mma do what the fuck i like
