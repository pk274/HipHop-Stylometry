i shuffle my feet and move to the left (ooh)
i check my outfit, i'm so fresh to death
hand my drink to wifey and sit my cup down
now the whole fam-bam gettin' down
i mean, i mean, i just had a plate of them greens
i'm on the dance floor groovin' like a dancing machine
i got my mind on my money like i usually do
i wanna be livin' for the love of you
see, it's your thing, so do what you wanna do
'cause you gon' have a good time when you in front of snoop
and that's for sure though
my mama say stop the music 'cause she wanna take a photo
so we oblige and step to the side (come on, come on)
now the whole fam doin' the electric slide (bring it in, y'all)
like that, one, two (one, two)
uncle ron, what you want 'em to do?
now you got it, let's do it again like
