i gots to do it
yes, yes loc', we keep the best smoke
me and my nigga, my nerve, my kinfolk
i kick a bitch in the ass and then smoke
i'm a motherfucking fool in the pool doing the breaststroke
you want a problem? well let's go
cause if not, i came to disco
and freak this ho from acopoqo
and flip her inside out, now i'm bout to ride out
let's go we hit the hood slow
post up, set up shop and press four
who got the best flow, who got the most dough
who got the best hoes, nigga you know
shit it's been ten years since i hit some cess smoke
but i still rock a mink coat on the west coast in the summertime
and i crumble mine down to the dandelion
nigga watch how i handle mine
spiritual, hear we go, hear this
snoop d-o-double-g, man i'm so fearless
square biz, you know what time it is
i'm cool on these niggas but i'm hard on a bitch
now check dis, fact is
put your back out, now back in
go head wiggle it round you feeling me now
girlfriend, you killing them now


the way you shake your booty
it makes me want your booty
the way you shake your booty
sure looks good to me
the way you shake your booty
it makes me want your booty
the way you shake your booty
sure looks good to me
