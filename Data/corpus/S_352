the boss in the building, feeling so cold
if this was houston i'd be feeling so throwed
i'mma stand up, you better man up
who going home with dogg?
put your hands up
puff pass and slide, you know the deal ho
i'm 10 shots in, that's on the real though
i got money love, and i ain't never scared
watch your bitch mayne, it's pimping everywhere
i got a lot of bad ones, yeah you see the troops
they get to popping off, until they see it's snoop
i'm loc'd out, the vodka all in me
baby got the henney, and we from rolling twenties
if you see me in the club and you know i'm turnt up
but your bitch keep looking at me

before you come fucking with me

eyes so glassy
bitch in the club, tryna harass me
i'm a taxi

and cover everything, like a fog do
bottle after bottle, nigga i'm turnt up
my eyes getting low, swisher burnt up
these hoes on one, tryna press a player
balling overseas, nigga i'm heavy there
leaning to the side, mixing all drinks
dubs up in here, like a gold mink
this long beach bitch, d-o-double-g
since 93', on top of v.i.p
watch your look mayne, the stare make it worse
i understand i'm famous, but i'm a gangster first
you better get him mayne, i'll beat his ass quick
i'm off the wall bitch, i'm full of that shit
