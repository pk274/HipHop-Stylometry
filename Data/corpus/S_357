i went in to grab a drink but i came out a felon
my homeboy got away but shit i wasn't tellin'
so i fell in a trap with no getback
they threw away the key and now i'm a og
in the county jail rappin and bangin' at the same time
and since i don't smoke cigarettes loc

from the etg eight-trey and oh yeah baby ken dawg
from the westside four-o's got love for short and my
homeboy j-ball from the seven four
