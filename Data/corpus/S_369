let me slide into this og rhyme
i do mine the way i do mine
and i takes my time when i'm droppin' my lines
i look around, i spot mc's (and they)
all in the place (and they) all wannabe's
tryin' to make their paper, tryin' to do they thang
but to me they all tryin' to say the same thang
how could you rap over beats that whack?
you ain't reachin' the crowd, you ain't makin' your fact
you ain't droppin' lines that hit the top
you can't make the party go hip-hop
and you can't do your thing without using mine
we get and steal, i see you're on the grind
but i'ma take my time to get my point across
and if you get caught up in the rap shit then got lost
and if you get tossed it's on your own, it's your own fault
see i gots ta get mine, i don't try no song
i just move on, groove on, try to prove on
then i do mines to do mines and i'mma keep on, keep on, keep on
to get'cha you in a... .smooth type of atmosphere
sit back and pay attention yeah
