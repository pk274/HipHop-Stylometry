you know my apparel, double barrel with the hollow points
my young homie in the back seat he swallowed joints
when the po-lice get after, we dipping on three wheels
cup filled to the rim, feather in my brim
headed to a party in the lbc
no limit soldiers with the dpg
when me and my homeboys step into the house
all the bitch-ass niggas start breaking out
cause you know they know what's up
so we started looking for the bitches with the big butts
like her but she keep crying, i gotta boyfriend bitch stop lying
punk-ass hooker ain't nothing but a dyke
suddenly i see some niggas that i dont like
cripped out, ripped out, flipped out, they dipped out
soon as they found out who we all a-bizout
