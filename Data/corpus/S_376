me and my partner in my impala
poppin our collars, tossin' up dollars
a truck on the side of us with hoes that wanna follow
bet a hundred dollars that they all wanna swallow
doggy doggfather
i do it to you real hard then it gets harder, it's not a
thang on mine, bang on mine
i smoke a ounce and bounce at the same time
it's off the limbo with timbo, you motherfuckin' bimbo
so quit knockin' at my window, you nympho
maniac, bring it back, now shake it up
put it on the table, now break it up
give it to me, now put a lighter on the end of it
it really don't matter what you spent on it
as long as you're gettin' what you paid for
that's what it made for, ain't that what you stayed for?


who that dippin' in the cadillac?
snoop dogg
smoke 'til your eyes get cataracts
snoop dogg
who got a girl layin' on her back?
snoop dogg
who that makin' that paper stack?
snoop dogg


you play me and i'll play you
you pay me and i'll pay you
hold on, boo, you got the game all wrong
this ain't your thang, this my song
move on, we in the club at the shark bar
valet my keys and park my car
no snapshots, 'cause i might get popped
as i slide by security, givin' 'em props
first thing i do when i get in
let me take you back to when i first slid in
grab my gin, get my pit in
put my bid in, no bullshittin'
we'll be sittin' in the corner
with smoke comin' from up under us like we sittin' in a sauna
burnin' up the charts, break a bitch heart
little mama, don't you start

tick-tock the ice on my watch
slapped me 'cross the face 'round two o'clock
but the party don't stop 'til we blow up
now every little bitch wanna show up
maneuverin' to this, groovin' to this
dippin' to this, flippin' to this, trippin' to this
ain't no skippin' to this, trust this
bust this, it's too hot to touch this
he say, she say, i say "no way"
don't need foreplay, okay, obey
everything that i say
and every day'll be like a holiday
i'll put you in the front seat of my car
and roll you 'round town like a superstar
recline your seat and turn up the beat
number one with a bullet rollin' down the motherfuckin' backstreets
