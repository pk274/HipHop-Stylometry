i get you up, stick you up, cut you up
gut you up, hit you up, touch you up
bust you up, fuck you up
la dada di, yeah do
a million rip riders all draped in blue
now follow my lead, all ya'll fall on your knees
hands up to the sky with your head down low
hopin' and wishin' i miss you with the chrome four-four
prayin' for my enemies 'cause them not know
oh no, here comes the bad guy
i spit the truth like your rabbi
ain't no witnesses the way that i been flippin' this
now what's infinite is i'm magnificent
and i mob deep everywhere that i been
shouts out to my homies in the motherfuckin' pen
yeah, still off the juice and gin
twenty years later, cousin, and i'm at it again
