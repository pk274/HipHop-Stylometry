i'm the coldest of the coldest, the dopest of the dopest
the smoothest of the smoothest and the locest of the locest
the whole world on point for this new joint that i just put together
so kindly, and you can find me on the coast with the most, layin' high post
playin' it close with a bunch of thug niggas, drug dealers
project fools, c-murder pass them tools
shit i'm 'bout to make these motherfuckers get up
i draw the line between yours and mines and make sure you don't get lit up
hit up the motherfuckin' set when i dip
(where you from?)
dogg pound motherfuckin' gangsta crip
split wigs for a livin', everyday's thanksgiving
motherfuck y'all rides, we slides, nigga we dippin'
the tank's driven by the colonel mr. master p
lil' silkky, mystikal, c, and me and fiend
nigga don't be trippin', cause we got my lil' homie in the cut
that's soulja slim nigga, he known for dippin', what's up?
(don't let go)
we love to bang bang
and the rap game is just like the dope game
the minute you forget it - forget it, you bit it
but them niggas know when you ain't with it
that's when they get ignant'
(don't let go)


life will twist ya like a twista, get twisted with this
it seems it's on, but it's off, i keep missin' and shit
i'm high but i try to stay focused, wide eyed
lookin' dead at the chips, i blink, they dip
(don't let go)

check this out man -
i'm the hardest of the hardest, the realest of the realest
see but i don't fuck with nothin' but g's, ballers, and killers
so pardon my expression g
if yo' bitch is seen with one of my niggas in the click
you best believe she done ate a gangsta dick
and you can't fault one of my niggas for that
shit, we just a bunch of thug niggas, ex-drug dealers
the kind of gangsta ass niggas that your bitch love niggas
but don't do that to yourself cause i'ma tell ya
i love to plug niggas with the slug niggas
now if yo' bitch way out of line
and you think about steppin' to doggy dogg, you better take your time
cause you out on a limb fuckin' with slim
and you don't even know that, cause ain't nobody told him that
i need to just show him that
cause i'm a pistol packin', car jackin', hoe smackin' mc
i don't know why all y'all bitches is fuckin' with me
fuck all my enemies, i'm chasin cheese with g's
servin' tapes and cd's by the three's and ki's
nigga, biggie was large, and 2pac was too real
they had homies with heat on the street and they still got killed
now how the fuck did that happen?, i thought them niggas was rappin'
but in this real world, shit, murder keep thangs crackin'
homicides, drive-by's, and kidnappin'
shit, when you head up out the door, nigga don't forget your fo'-fo'
never leave home without it, shit, why dogg?
cause niggas everywhere gettin' rowdy and bout it, and don't doubt it
real violence aside, just don't forget it
cause like i said, when you ain't with it, them niggas get ignant'
