i think it's bout' time for me hit these **** upside they head with some of that west coast gangsta ****
ooh-wee (ooh-wee)


it's a whole 'nother day
i'm back up in ya
snoop d-o-double g
i represent-uh
been away for a while but you all know
i'm still doggystylin' on death row
got shit locked down
sewed up
so if you plan on comin' out, nigga, hold up
this a stick up
dick up
they got yo' shit on the shelf, oh, mine is too
and guess who they gon' pick up?
some niggas think they know they shit, but they don't
some inmates escape, some won't
bumpin' heads with niggas, where you from?
east side long beach, nigga, two one
the homie just got paroled
and he got more stories than the highway patrol
tellin' me about the money suge knight stole
but don't let that shit leak, 'cause, nigga, i get swole
niggas tryin' to get in to get at me
put me up on game, tellin' me who gon' jack me
but ever since i was a puppy 'til i was full grown
i never had no other dog pullin' on my bone


say snoop's upside yo' head
say snoop's upside yo' head
say snoop's upside yo' head
say snoop's upside yo' head
say snoop's upside yo' head
say snoop's upside yo' head
say snoop's upside yo' head
say snoop's upside yo' head


niggas in the game be doin' way too much
actin' tough with this east-west coast stuff
see me, i'm all about my money, mane
i stay fly and dry
i don't get caught up in the rain
'cause game recognize game
no matter where you from
we all can get dumb, insane and
turn the party out without a doubt
unless you them niggas who ain't got no clout
lbc and b what? uh, my crew
'cause uh, we out there smokin' on the krazy glue
upside yo' head like "oops"
snoop's the shit, that you hear when bumpin' in the hoops
can't afford it, homeboy, this is vintage
i represented from v-a to venice
so when it's timid and cold outside
rely on the doggy dogg
to put the heat in yo' life

say snoop's upside yo' head
say snoop's upside yo' head
say snoop's upside yo' head
say snoop's upside yo' head
say snoop's upside yo' head
say snoop's upside yo' head
say snoop's upside yo' head


it takes a whole lot to be number one
i can't walk down the street without my gun
i can't trust these niggas, fool, it ain't no fun
i'm sittin' up in court 'cause somebody got dumb
what really counts is how the crowd bounce
go home and say "snoop rocked the party"
nobody got killed is what got announced
i guess they got a chance to see dr. bombay
but i keep my heat in case niggas get cold
warm you up with the sheet
zip you up and roll
now, doggystyle records is now official
gettin' money at the pliz-ate with my initials
shippin' records overseas, i'm makin' g's
with who you may call enemies
but i see nothing funny about makin' money
'cause, uh, we all know it don't grow on trees
so i gotta get what i gotta get when i can
up early in the mornin' wit' the gap band
burning rubber down to get a new car
so don't get jealous when you see me in the double r
