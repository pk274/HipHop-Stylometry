you gotta play your part when you're rollin' with the r-o-c
c'mon little mama, c'mon
you gotta know what it takes to be down with a nigga like me
get your mind right mami, get your mind right
c'mon little mama, c'mon
i need a gangsta girl, who can ride in my passenger seat
get your mind right mami, get your mind right
c'mon baby girl, c'mon
and i need gangsta girls, for my gangsta family
get your mind right mami, get your mind right
c'mon little mama, c'mon


p-i-m-p-ology
i play you and you pay me
believe me when i tell you girl i know you a freak
for fuckin' with me, that ain't all you can be
just put your mind to it you can go real far
i know times gettin' hard on the coulevard
they say, pimpin' is dead (what?), man, pimpin' ain't dead
these hoes just scared and they blind tryin' and dyin' to be led (mm)
but who's to lead 'em? talk shit to 'em and beat 'em
get they mind right and feed 'em
now i don't need 'em (uh-uh), but i can do that there
put on a three-piece suit and shirley temple my hair
so i can, feel like a player when i walk in the place (place)
got yo' bitch all on my line, and now she up in my face
is this yo' bitch? is that yo' bitch? 'cause if she's not, she mine
she falling for a nigga and i ain't even dropped a line


get out my limelight bitch, and get your mind right
c'mon, little mama, c'mon (c'mon, c'mon)
get your mind right bitch, get your mind right
c'mon baby girl, c'mon, c'mon (c'mon)
