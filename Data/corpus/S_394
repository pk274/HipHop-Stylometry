the run around, the rap around (rap aight)
you talk, then you walk, me i’m shaftin’ down (sh-sh)
see me and the pigs, we don’t fuck around (uh-uh)
that snitching in the hood, lemme’ break that down (break it down)
they do theirs, we do ours, understand me?
i’m blued up, crippin’ with my family
and we don’t give a fuck about the
pos, the cos, cause we know
if we goes
then we go
we do time, then parole
now i’m back on the black at night shift
stack on the top i’m cockin’ it
back in the block and you know i’m cooping it
shoebox full of money with a sock in it
and we celebrating the ghetto by popping it
so no champagne or crystola
machine guns and pistolas--
blaw, hood shit
like that? game over (over)
see in my hood we crip, or dip
so follow me, follow me, follow me, follow me
on some gangsta shit,ya biotch
