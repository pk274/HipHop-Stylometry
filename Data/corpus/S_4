do you remember a real gang member?
choppin' til he timber, december to december
never stoppin', too busy poppin' off lead in the heat
clownin' ass all around him, they crown him the dogg father
glock hot, crock pot on the block with a chef
out of bounds on the grounds with a hole in your chest
invest in back in feedback, gorilla the west
take a whiff of me, spliff, till it fill up my chest
convertible with the cadillac, mackin' the mack
with some roscoe's chicken in my lap, imagine that
i'm groovin' down sunset boulevard
no harm, no foul, no body guard


stealth but get loud like a space shuttle
catch a case, a motherfuckers got a place for you
and it's 100 brothers like you that's cold with the typhoo
slang and things and buck 50 with the jinzu
draw that line, flip that dime, spit that nine
homie this crip on mine
thought you knew
we cold crushin' bum rush the chef, it's my nephew
the king of the west too, niggas to test you
let your next move be your best move
ja bless you
1,2 1,2 what you gone do when we come through?
1,2 1,2
