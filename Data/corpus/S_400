with so much drama in the lbc
it's kind of hard bein' snoop d-o-double-g
but i, somehow, some way

and they ain't leavin' 'til six in the mornin'

so what you wanna do?

so turn off the lights and close the doors
but (but what?), we don't love 'em, though (yeah)
so we gon' blow an ouncе to this
g's up, freeze up for a second, now bounce to this
