with so much drama in the l-b-c
it's kind of hard bein' snoop d-o-double-g
but i, somehow, some way
keep comin' up with funky-ass shit, like, every single day
may i kick a little something for the g's
and make a few ends as i breeze through?
it's two in the mornin' and the party's still jumpin'
â€˜cause my momma ain't home
i got some birds in the livin' room gettin' it on
and what time they leaving? six in the mornin'
so what you wanna do?
look, i got a pocket full of rubbers, and panic, you know they got 'em too
so turn off the lights and close the doors
but (but what?) we don't love hoes, hell yeah
so we gon' smoke an ounce to this
g's up, hoes down, while you motherfuckers bounce to this


rollin' down the street, (put your hands in the air) smokin' indo
sippin' on gin and juice, (yeah) laid back
with my mind on my money
and my money on my mind
rollin' down the street, (what you say now?)
smokin' indo (what you say now? says who)
sippin' on gin and juice, i'm so laid back
with my mind on my money
and my money on my mind

yeah!
