it's enough of that to go around
real g's make the hood go 'round
keep the planet spinnin' on it's axis
how is he so hood? how can you ask this?
i guess you can say i put in practice
on the strip, under lights, now i'm back bitch
and even if i'm blown on my own
with the chrome to your dome
make you stretch like elastic
i need my real g's to the left
bitch niggas staying to the right
i need my hoes front and center
hard on these hoes from the summer to the winter
spring to the fall, hoes still on my balls
it's the number one nigga from the hood  doggy dogg
still pull up on a nigga when i need to be heard
i'm a killer and a stealer, but i ain't from pittsburgh
real shit on the set, i get your whole clique served
you best observe, a b chalked out on the curb
with your momma and your people sayin' "supercrip did it"
they won't testify, so he got away with it
now i'm sttin' on my throne, on my bat phone
i'm talkin' to iron man, while smokin' some fire, man
look up in the sky, it's a bird, it's a plane
walkin' through the clouds with a crip stick cane
