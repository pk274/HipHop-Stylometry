nigga, you need to stop snitchin'
all that yip-yappin' and jaw-jackin'
nigga, if you scared, go to church
you knew the job was dangerous when you took it
what up, it's the big boss dogg, snoop d-o-double-g, eastside l-b-c
and i'm bobbin' to the beat of my og homeboy ice cube
and i'm c-walkin' on the motherfuckin' concrete


click-clackin', pistol packin', crip raggin' folio
who the only nigga in the club with the toolio?
you ain't know? yeah, you did; there it was, there it is
"is that coolio?", nah, bitch, let me in
jibber-jabber, snatch ya, get at ya
spit at actors and rappers
hang out with kidnappers and jackers
make money off crackers; can you imagine how i keep shit crackin'?
it's the big boss dogg, i'm back in action and smashin'
i flash with the bling, i surpass the supreme
you don't really wanna have a clash with my team
i mix hash with the green, i'm the last of the kings
if i got a bitch with me, she got ass in them jeans
rollin' through your neighborhood, my cadillac so clean
servin' all you suckas, 'cause you all dope fiends
just like that dope man, nigga, what's up?
you run up with that bullshit, i'll fuck yo' ass up
