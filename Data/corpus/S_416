josey wales was known for robbin' trains and banks
layin everybody down for diamond rings and chains
it remains the same in the year you live in, see
'cause if i pull out some heat, nigga, you'll go kick in
and that's just the rules set by the fool from the ol' school
when it's time to duel, you get two men
two heaters, one street, one clock
and when it strike twelve one of y'all gon' drop
if you're quick on the draw
you're gon' see the morgue
but if you're too slow
i catch you on the downlow (oh no)
oh no, you mean the kid, shit's real
i ain't no john wayne, these niggas gangbang
the four horsemen, that's the click i'm wit
you mean the little bitty niggas with the itchy trigger fingers
yeah, we're on a mission ta kansas, slippin thru texas
we stopped at bonanza to get us some hot cakes
bacon and eggs, and then we slip in the whorehouse to get us some leg
hop back on the horses, enforcers of courses
the niggas in black, the fearless four horsemen
searchin for this location on the map
the gold rush, baby, got ta have it (i gots ta have it)
it feels just like it's 1865
and a trigger look-a-day is how i ride
