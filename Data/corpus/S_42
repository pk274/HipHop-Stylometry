i don’t want nobody fuckin’ with me in these streets, children
i don’t want nobody fuckin’ with me in these streets, uh-uh
i don’t want nobody fuckin’ with me in these streets, cause

ain’t nobody got time for that
ain’t nobody got, ain’t nobody got
ain’t nobody got time for that


all i bang is that crip shit, trip this
big snoop dogg with my cousin trick trick
put the hammer to your bisquick to your biscuit
jam with the jelly sellin’ grams at the telly
on the celly with the plinug

we even got homies in akron and ok-c
and i'm the g that go and see em'
holla at a nigga on the dm

40 years nigga, bangin’ the east
and i can’t stop and i won’t stop
even though i got a grip, still 20 crip nigga
