see that's why i see it nigga
you talkin bout he put his first record out in 2000
i don't give a fuck about his first record coming out in 2000
he was fuckin it up before that
man, we just tell the nigga he was ready to go
we put him on a couple of songs when bad probably had him on some bullshit ass songs
he was goin hard in the motherfucker
so you can't go from a child star into manhood and still be a star
and still maintain your status and still be able to you know, do your thing
