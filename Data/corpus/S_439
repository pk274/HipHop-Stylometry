drink 'til you're drunk, smoke like a broke stove
don't quit, take flight, i can't remember last night
it's aight, this the life of a superstar
sci-fi with that boy trooping hard, couping cars
snoop be hard in the paint, drink another cup until i fall flat
all lead and then some 1-5-1, done dilly
really for sure that, i'm throw back intoxicated
change over, game over, hangover, faded
body shit miss
대체 어디 있으
꾀꼬리 못 찾겠어
eeny-eeny, meeny, miny, moe
catch a lady by the toe
안 예쁘면 예뻐 보일
때까지 빠라삐리뽀 (hey)


drink it up and get sick
bottom's up, get wasted
pour it up, drink it up, live it up, give it up
oh my god, dammit, there's the fucking limit
pour it up, drink it up, live it up, give it up (hey)


받으시오
but i can't stop
making bottles pop until the wheels fall off (hey)
받으시오
and i can't quit
i wake up in the morning, do the same shit (hey)
wake up in the morning, do the same shit


drink it up and get sick
bottom's up, get wasted
pour it up, drink it up, live it up, give it up
oh my god, dammit, there's the fucking limit
pour it up, drink it up, live it up, give it up (hey)


받으시오
but i can't stop (hey)
making bottles pop until the wheels fall off (hey)
받으시오
and i can't quit (hey)
i wake up in the morning, do the same shit
hangover


hangover, hangover, hangover, hangover-over-over (hey)
hangover, hangover, hangover, hangover-over-over (hey)
hangover, hangover, hangover, hangover-over-over (hey)
hangover, hangover, hangover, hangover-over-over (hey)
