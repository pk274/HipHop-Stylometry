what you smoking on, let me get you loose
have some hennessey, mix it with this apple juice
see we can have a ball, that's where the heat play
i know the dj and he gone let the beat play
i ain't forgot bout, you know i care bout you
i been thinkin bout you, tryin to get this drink up out you
now if you buy me one, and then you buy me two
and now we doin shots, man i gots to have you
