happy summertime, niggas (ahh, yeah)
we rolling, we rolling, we rolling, we rolling
we rolling, we rolling, we rolling, we rolling
yeah


slip, dip, trip, we flip the new hit
you gots to do it with mr. cool whip
'cause i'm better than the rest of them
i'm two-stepping on lake michigan
oh my god, my nephew done did it again
pool full of women and more tryna get in
well, c'mon, it's all cool, ain't no rules
it's the summertime, so we gon' act a fool
what you wanna do? nah, what you oughta do
is rush me a plate of that barbecue with a quickness
move fast, better yet, move quicker
then get my a 40 ounce from kenwood liquor
slide by millennium park
one more spot to hit before it gets dark
lake shore drive, slip 'til we slide
summertime on the westside, westside, westside
