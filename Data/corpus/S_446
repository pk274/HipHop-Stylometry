you see the system was designed to keep us all down
that's why it's up to me to never let them turn it around
burning it down
my sound go cray through it
put a real team to it
don't dream, do it
see, we got to be a little more careful
it's getting unbearable
this shit is so terrible
now take a look in the mirror
it seems like you can't see what i see
so let me make it more clearer
it's hard being black
give us all that fame, then you take it right back
now how we 'posed to act
now we can't work, can't eat like that
these are rules of the game
they build you up and knock you down
and leave you full of ashame
materialistic
gravy and bisquick
when you're black
it's a fact
living life is optimistic
