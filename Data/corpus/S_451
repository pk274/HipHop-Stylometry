made a milli' off the flow, now it's time to reinvent it
i'm the soldier and lieutenant, i'm the owner and the vendor
yeah, the angel and the sinner, main course and the dinner
mike, glove with the glitter, doin' deals on the shitter (what?)
you won't find a nigga realer, you can look around thе globe
shit get hot up in the kitchеn, so don't stand around the stove
i'm from long beach, nigga, i ain't hang out at the grove
i was hustlin' with them hustlers gettin' payouts from the blow
blue chucks on the soles on the foot of a man (yeah)
niggas talkin' about gettin' money, but how good is the plan?
middle finger to the law, one foot in the sand
ran this motherfuckin' town and 'bout to do it again (woah, why, why?)
all the shit these niggas talkin', i can smell they whispers (why?)
y'all get hot, then not, but me, i remain a fixture (i'd do it all again)
how i walk and how i talk and paint the cripture (ooh-wee)
right before i let this stainless hit you (oh-oh), nigga, i'ma sing this with you (yeah, oh)
