gave it to the homie and he had to get it back
took it to the corner let him double up his 
burst on a nigga for the turf, what it’s worth
give a fuck, nigga, truth hurts. do low
two oh, yellow paint on the grill, ride by
slide by, big homie on the wheel, no witness
relentless, back on the streets after eight years
sentence, still jumping fences
the job ain’t hiring, ain’t there no motherfuckin’
gangbang retirement, you’re either in it
for life, or you’re not. pray that you don’t
get shot on the block have what you have not
