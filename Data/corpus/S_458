hip hop hooray, we rock away
so hot, just stop, oh, not today
roll you up like a proper j
you belong to the dogg, my property
yes, miss goapele
did i give it to you so properly?
oohs and ahs, ahs and oohs
glass of booze, splashin’ crews
have you ever been around the world with a boss?
poppin’ p, shopping sprees, i don’t care what it cost
doing me, you and me, and we gon’ get lost
d-o-g, you’ll see with me you’re better off
