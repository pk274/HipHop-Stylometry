i wake up just to bake up, get my cake up and rise up
motivating factors that i'm liver than most
i boast and bang, pour some pain in that thing
put some purple rain on your brain, unravel the flame
maintain my fame, get you new pictures just to put in your frame
we in the hood blowing kush with the game
foot in the cane, walking just like i'm an indian chief
with no beef, real brief, with a wreath - you may think it's a leaf
with the residue stuck deep down in your teeth
when you smoking with the dogg, shit, you might not eat!
it's ok, cause we lay, in the cut, on the hill, on the dip
with a fit, on crip, don't trip, i need some
