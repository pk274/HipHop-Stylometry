first giving honor, god heavenly father
i'm moving to your spirit, control every part of
my life and all the drama, even through the pain
even through the problems, i'mma still praise your name
i got a little testimony, wanna tell you 'bout it
devil tried to bring me down, knock me off the mountain
i told my mom about it, she just started singing, shoutin'
said my blessings coming soon, flowing like a fountain
your face stronger through your trials and your tribulations
but give it all to god, a little time, a little patience
name it, claim it, your joy coming in the morning time
keep this on your mind, even on your grind
take him with you everywhere you go, keep your soul fed
she rubbed some blessed oil on my forehead
in the name of the father, son, holy spirit
take control, make him whole, joy coming full fold
