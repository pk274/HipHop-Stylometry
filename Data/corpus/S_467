cuz were all a little strong
in the beach where the papers long
but as for me i only g when i'm buss'n rocks {so take that}


i'm slappin bones
tryin to get some bones
with some dogg pound gangstas in front of my home
bigg 6, bigg 5 3's with ya bitches
my girls in the kitchen cookin up some fish
i'm blastin at this nigga that was trippin
knuckle head nigga, thought i was slippin
but i wasn't slippin i was on deck
i blast his ass, peck peck know his shirts wet
dead gone lights out
with no remorse, i had to take him out
i'm laughin at this shit cause it was funny
fuckin with the dogg i take your life and your money
and now i dip too my spot
and set up shop with yo rocks
and bet nobody speak on the 8-7
cuz still all doggs go to heaven
from my hood to your hood
game reconize it's all to the good
so here's a toast to the indo
doing it like it's the thang to do
i thought you knew


freestylin, c-stylin
snoop and pooh comin through fixin to take you to the island
where the bitches and the bud come free
and everybody listen to the d-o double g
hoes on my dick, niggas on my nuts
people be lovin me because i drop cuts
that makes sense and make big money
snoop is that nigga who don't half to play funny
but i got your honey up under my wing
cuz she like that song that the bow wow sing
i'll put her in a cling
i won't buy her a ring
but i'll put her on a hoe stroller, make me some green
and even if she never even saw me before
there's just no way that she can tell me no
'cause my game's unbelievable baby
and it's strong enough to make your grandmama pay me

**snoop talking**
you know what i'm sayin
is this the question that you have to ask?
only the strong survive
but you gotta ask the questions:
who are the survivors? eastsidaz yea
