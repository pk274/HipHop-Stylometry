ladies and gentlemen
we got rare essence in the house tonight
and they got a very special guest with 'em
we talkin' 'bout the king of the lbc!


i pull up to the white house, take a piss on the lawn
send tiny to the van and get the back of the bong
i find my destination, put my back on the bench
white ladies walkin' by, they want some pictures and shit
so i figured i'd get up and give 'em something to wild about
living my best life, that's what this smile about
and when it come to doing this, i think i'm the freshest
as rare as they come, in rare form with rare essence
breeze through the trees, fly birds in the sky
lady lookin' at me with a wink in her eye
blinking and drinking, thinking that she can get menace with me
sippin' some hennessy, g, when she finish we'll see
and now if she want more, then i got plenty
you know she gets litty, baby, when it's four-twenty
so why must i chase the cat?
'cause i'm a dog motherfucker and it be's like that (shorty, c'mon)
