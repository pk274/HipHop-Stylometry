i do, love you but you hate me at the same time
lights, camera, action, it's game time
do you take this here as your lovely wife?
to love her and cherish her for all your life?
i solemnly swear to dare share and take you there
and me and you together, baby, we a lucky pair
it's been a long time, we walked a thin line
others say they got you but you been mine
as i sit back and watch all them cat fights
domestic violence â€” is that right?
but you love the dogg, gave me the spotlight
and now i'm growin' up, showin' up, blowin' up
i never ever thought that we would separate at all
but you played me like a game of football
used to feed me, need me, dress me
now it's so messy straight cut out and left me


hollywood divorce
all the fresh styles always start off as a good little hood thing
look at blues, rock, jazz, rap
not even talkin' about music
everything else too
by the time it reach hollywood it's over
but it's cool
we just keep it goin' and make new shit
take our game, take our name
give us a little fame
and then they kick us to the curb that's a cold thang
