man i came through with that big fat chain on my neck
little did they know, no sweat
so i dimmed out, rimmed out and cracked the glass
twenty-five pounds, can you match that bag?
'cause if you not, raise up
i got a deal to make
and a couple bad bitches
i've been achin' to break
wakin' and bake
i put the cake on the plate
jealousy and me? oh, we're making a date
i'ma vibe with this, hollywood, nigga i'ma survive this shit
i do that, did that, blow your fuckin' wig back
forreal-a, gorilla, who loves goin' bareback
they wanna eye me down, tie me down, knock me off
but i'm a lion in the dogg pound
now, how that sound?
