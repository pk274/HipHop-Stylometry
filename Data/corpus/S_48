you know i'm doin' big thangs for me
got big thangs, you know what i mean?
you don't even understand it you know what i mean?
big riches it's a blessin'
anyway, check it out


and i ain't having big things, ain't it man?
you know i'm from a crip gang, ain't it man?
ain't afraid to let my nuts hang, ain't it man?
and smoke a lot of mary jane, ain't it man?
and i never been in love before, ain't it man?
a gangsta nigga on his throne, ain't it man?
you know i'm doing big things, ain't it man?
you know i'm about that good thang, ain't it man?


twist up a swisha sweety put some foul in that bitch
lets get wild
lets get high
come on, lets take a few hits
sip some drink, count yo bank or do whatever you feel
pop the top on yo lacker, is that a snoopy deal?
it's got to be monopoly it's how i play on this field
a quarterback with the sack, i got a team to build
a dream to fill, scheme for mills, wheels and deals
do how i feel, don't give a fuck how i feel
and that's for real
a lot of pimp niggas be poppin' up
ever since me and magic juan made it popular
pimpin' ain't easy, for sheezy, my neezy, cuff your breezy
and remember this nigga when you see me


you know i'm doing big things, ain't it man?
you know i'm from a crip gang, ain't it man?
ain't afraid to let my nuts hang, ain't it man?
and i smoke a lot of mary jane, ain't it man?
oh, waaaah, ain't it man? x8
