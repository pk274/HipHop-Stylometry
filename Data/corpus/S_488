big snoop dogg
my nephew hardwell on the beat
give it to me


easy on the eyes, dressed to impress
nonetheless, i guess you can say i'm the best
so you can see why, she's my p-y-t
she in love with the one d-o double g
s-n, just in the nick of time
champagne, what a twist of line, just in time
celebrate, raise your glass, and blaze your blunts
and keep giving me whatever i want
i love how you love me
kissin' and huggin' me
you're where i wanna be
i don't want no company
as long as you comfort me
and stay with me, come with me
but do it abundantly
yes, you got a g with you
and i make plans just to be with you
no wishin' well
five star hotel
all kiss, no tell
now say, hardwell
