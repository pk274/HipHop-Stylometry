now they put they hands out, cause of the way shit bend
so you niggas ain't smokin' if you don't chip in
listen, i waited long for these rocks to glisten
from that one-room pad without a pot to piss in
overt betrayal is not forgiven
i do this for my niggas locked up that's comin' home to lobster livin
helping the cop's forbidden, 'bout to buy momma her own mansion
just so i can see her pop the ribbon
that cali bud special, so special i held the blunt so long
snoop had to tell me, "pass the weed nephew!"
fuck rap, i'm the wrong one to get pissed off
cause the pump'll make you "jump" like kris kross
my nigga dead and it's hard to let go
so i'm blowin' on that wet doe, same color as gecko
we follow hood codes and everybody in the set know
we gas 'em, fuck 'em and pass 'em, what you expect ho?


say 'gain won't you blow it with the best of them
yes yes i blessted them, blazed up the purple palm trees
i told dem don't mess wit dem, i hold dem no testament
do you want to smoke wit me?
weed rollin', g-strollin', bad-mouthin' muh'fucker
law breakin', pimp slappin' niggas for the fuck of it
hip-hoppin', ziplockin', riprockin' gangbanger
"thought you was an actor," thought i was a singer
thought about riding if you say you wanna hang tough
d.p.g. unit sounds like danger
you might wanna manage your anger
hang with us and stop smokin' on the same stuff
now lay back on the law
this new weed that i got i call it face off
cause it'll blow your face off and that's a figure of speech
my niggas a beast, on me, from the west to the east, preach!
