mount westmore is in the house, baby (yay-yay)
and we want y'all to know that we got pull (ayo, 40)
i mean that real pull
you know, the plug, the connect, baby


in and out, out and in
get with the dogg if you wanna win
set the records while i set the trend
show you how to boss ball, dip it and bend
around the corner with gangsta shit, drop it and hit the switch
pull up to the homie house, smoke a little bit
off to the city, grind more, time's getting gritty
got a lot of pull, nigga, get with me
dark tint on the bentley (hey), never no scent but i'm simply
the best nigga to leave a nigga empty
now i got fifty knockin' at your front door, dumpin'
you don't wanna start nothin', don't tempt me
og to bg, you on the clock, don't sleep
young homies on you and they roll deep
i got the gold hammer pointed at your gold teeth
211, homicide, blame it on the police
