you know i got to do it big every time i do it
walking around with a tall glass of pimp fluid
matching outfits to go along with my cup
seven pieces, now go ahead and add it up
don’t it look good to ya? sho’ you right
i bust a brand new 6 like every other night
half a dozen—one to my brother, two to my cousin
now that leaves me three of ‘em
and now we buzzin’, sippin’ on cris’ fa sho
and now you wanna kiss me slow
saying snoop dogg’s irresistible
be professional, ‘cause i don’t see…
nothing wrong with us dipping to the pizzad
to do it real bizzig and act real bizzad
all of y’all on me, high g
that’s 70 toes that just jumped out of rolls
you know how it goes
