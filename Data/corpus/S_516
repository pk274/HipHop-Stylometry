baby, i'm a rich nigga
diamonds on my wrist glitter
show you the big picture (yessir)
hit your bitch like "wow", glitter
bitch, i've been limpin', a hundred years pimpin'
i drop my bitch off and the top is no different
i'm rollin', so rich, ain't no hot, cold crippin'
on the pole, that's why it's icy hot, more drippin' (i still got it)


(gangsta grillz)
got it, a nigga still got it
if not, then why i got your bitch hangin' off my pockets?
(off my pockets, nigga)
niggas know my address, but never rob it
got it, it ain't nothin' but some bitches and a rocket
old money that i can't even deposit (i still got it)
oh, no, young thugs, you better watch it
a nigga still got it (feel somethin', right?)
got it (dj drama)
a nigga still got it (okay, catch the vibe)
got it
