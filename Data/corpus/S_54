pick up the pace, turn up the bass
i'm singing this right in your face
i made the call forgive me
cause i did this all for you
so whether you do or whether you don't
this gon' bang and this gon' bump
hit your j or split your blunt
dpg then we turned up
blue bandana, french montana
all around the world first class
vip, bubble bath
touchdown, two points
wide reciever khalifa bless me with two joints
they told big dick dogg, he gotta get up on this hit dog
turn it up let me hear the beat for a second
have a few puffs then i breathe on the record
then we go like merri-go, round and round
this right here is for the underground
i wonder how, i break it down for you
