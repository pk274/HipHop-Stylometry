and once upon a time, in a city so divine
called west side compton, there stood a little nigga
he was five-foot somethin', god bless the kid
took his homies to the show and this is what they said:

and once upon a time, in a city so divine
called west side compton, there stood a little nigga
he was five-foot something, dazed and confused
talented but still under the neighborhood ruse
you can take your boy out the hood
but you can't take the hood out the homie
took his show money, stashed it in the mozey wozey
hollywood's nervous
fuck you, goodnight, thank you much for your service
