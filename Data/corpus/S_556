legendary

niggas so impressed by other niggas raps
but the thing you know best is "bought a tec" is cap
'cause you could get jacked on site if you ain't precise
figure-four fistfights, make the homies take flight
flight, take off on you, like i ain't goin' to work today
most of your favorite rappers pussy, i know it hurt to say
my mama told me hold my brother down, 'cause she was workin' late
my cousin turned muslim the minute hе beat that murder case
i'vе been all around the world and i've been doin' my thing-thing
some say that i'm the reason while y'all gangbang
while you was in grade school, i'm takin' faze full
crippin' is international, so now we gettin' paid, fool
they tryna rig the culture, you could say they vultures
you dead sauce, so why the fuck you reachin' for that holster?
gangbangin' is a test, the stress'll give you an olser
snatch that chain off your neck, don't care if that shit a choker
cuz see cripped out, why you so seasick?
cold on a ho', i leave that bitch in me, me
call me and dave east, nigga, that's what we win
harlem thirties with that lbc shit
people what we get, avoidin' the preset
i'm hard as the cement, we robbed him for three bricks
avoid niggas that every time they call me, they need shit
i'm billy d smooth, blue flag and dg crip
ricky ross, frank lucas, bumpin' your tucky williams
all of 'em had the crown, but none of 'em took it with 'em
so it's our job to do what they couldn't do
hardwired for this shit, one, two, one, two


so if you're lookin' for some real g's
let me show you where my niggas at (where my niggas at?)
and if you're lookin' for the bubble gum (yessir)
holler at me (holler at me), i'll holler back
