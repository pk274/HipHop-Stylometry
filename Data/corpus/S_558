hide the women, hide the kids, it's a crip on the loose
how the fuck i let dre talk me back into the booth?
ridin' with some blue devils, all they know is run and shoot
know that's a pretty gun, look at what my city done
wreak havoc, i was savage 'fore 21
seen my first mill' 'fore i turned twenty-one, you can ask anyone


i'm from 21st street (21st, yeah, 21st, 21st, 21st, 21st)

ayy, welcome, nigga, back from the gutter, run for cover
straight up gospel, chicken and waffles, guns and butter
true devotion, blue promotion
shit in my bones, funeral homes, three-wheel motion
ayy, fool, i'm a vet, you can bet
bet i can walk through the set without gettin' checked
back then i had a mac-10 bangin' with the groom folks
shit'll get deep, watch your tone, lo'
eighteen, i was cookin' up my own dope
collect call from the homies, 'til the fuckin' phone broke
a lot of close calls, been through it all
warren g, nate dogg, corner pocket, 8-ball
mama's cryin', babies dyin'
government lyin', that's why we in it throwin' up signs
they say the c is for crazy, r is for ruthless
eye for an eye, p for power, gangster music
