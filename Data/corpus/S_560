something about these bitches, they try to pimp the pimp
but i'm not one of them niggas
bitch, i am not no simp (say what)
you'll never catch me slippin', you got it fucked up thick
go try them other niggas (not me), 'cause i am far from a trick


she get it from her mama, ask me how i know
i met her at a celly cel show in 9-4
she was real freaky, that little homie squeaky
had one wit' him so she made the three piece
kiki, vicki, which one will pick me?
slip me, suck me, fuck me, complete me
help me release the toxins inside
9-point-5, enjoy the ride
this is just a fragment while i'm rappin' and shit
laughin' and shit, loco mackin' ya bitch
these hoes nowadays, they'll play you (play you)
attention is all i'll pay you
say you never been talked to like that
it gets shitty, hit fifty, bitch, skip the crap
i stole your glow, bitch, you's a ho
now everybody in the world know
