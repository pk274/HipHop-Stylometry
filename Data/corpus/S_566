bootzilla, baba


you wanna play with me?
hold on, you wanna play with it? i wanna lay with it
all day with it, is you with it?
and when i do it, you know i did it
'cause my groove is exquisite, it's such a privilege
you wanna play with it? i wanna lay with it
all day with it, is you with it?
'cause if you ain't, you gotta quit playin' with a playa


ohh, oh-oh, woah-woah, oh-oh (yeah, thought you was playin')
i'm gettin' ready to jam
ohh, oh-oh, woah-woah, oh-oh
i'm gettin' ready to jam


pass the pill, ink the deal
snoop dogg in the paint like big shaquille
toss me a lob, i'm on the job, i'm hard at work
threes, yeah, my crossover sure will freeze ya
tease ya, just a minute
you know i been down ever since i came up in it
they call me the pick of the litter, the big game spitter
uncle boots said, "get 'em, snoop dogg," so i bit 'em
