ayo, dogg, what's happenin' with motherfuckin' hip-hop, man?
give us some lyrics, cuh
some of that real hip-hop, you know what i'm talkin' 'bout?
boy, you lost it, nigga


it was him (who?) then me (who?) and no one after
so i blazed my trail and wrote my own chapters
stomped down pterodactical raptors
game's sustained, my new jersey's in the rafters


statisticians, they keep up with it
no sleep 'til they get it
and once they got it, they count it
so i learned how to dismount it
my landing was perfect
a man with a purpose
i learned to resurface
a boss but no workers
while you're sleepin', i'm lurkin'
i'm shifty at fifty, i keep the work and i'm workin'
big snoop d-o-double-g
yеllow like bumblebee
mellow likе r&b
your bitches keep followin' me
i'm right where i oughta be
plottin' my pottery
i'm watchin' my calories
rechargin' my batteries
a ticket up front? that's my usual salary
they imitatin' my style, shit, i call it flattery
i'm here forever, nigga, and that's just what that'll be
look it up, hook it up
charge it to the game until you book it up
take a picture, nigga, look at us
hit-boy and snoop dogg in the kitchen, nigga, cookin' up


it was him then me and no one after
so i blazed my trail and wrote my own chapters
stomped down pterodactical raptors
game's sustained, my new jersey's in the rafters (nigga)


yeah
2022
death row records
