young, dumb, and full of cum
lil crazy ass nigga, homie where you from

he won't fuss he'll just bust
ask those fucks i left 'em in dust

and talk big shit man yo bitch so quick and dip
hop on the site like like we used to do
fly handlebars, his all-stars is blue
keeping it true 7 days a week
and he livin' with his momma
