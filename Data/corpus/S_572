you know what? - you know what?
i'm taking trips to cabo, with my death row family
we're out on the road, we're sporting diamonds and gold
we're pushing yachts and jet skis, smoking on hell of weed
we're trying to have millions man, y'all can have them gs
bitches flocking up eying nothing, all about them papers
we're standing away from the player-haters and the impersonators
but we're sporting gators and we don't cater to no hoe
from san diego to vallejo and all the way down to idaho
and then you wonder why this game won't change
they say you gotta heart, from the very start
so when i step into a club like magic city
and get greeted with ass and a whole lotta tittes
and pull up to a seed at the nearest bar
and post up, just like a double r
don't get mad, 'cause a nigga ain't spent shit
i'm just watching and besides i'm a pimp, bitch!
