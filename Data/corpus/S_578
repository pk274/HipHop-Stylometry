ayy, hand me them box of chocolates so i can twist me a blunt
i'll holla at the homie down front with the pump
bum-bum-bum-bum, we thump in a funk
my living room smell like a batch of skunk
my girl keep complainin', poppin' junk and stuff
you say one more word, tramp, and i'ma fuck you up
police came through and they cuffed me up
i'm out fifteen minutes later 'cause i'm boss as fuck
was taught this a long time ago, check a ho
if you don't, you won't, traits of a punk
they threw his face on the trunk
in the face of a punk, with a pump, finna dump
mmm, my nigga loved gettin' crunk
until they found him slumped
by the border with a quarter in his pocket
layin' in a puddle of blood and water
(y'all oughta know by now)
