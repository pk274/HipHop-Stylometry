step right in, come on down see you's a bad girl
and i'mma put you on your knees then your back girl
i burn you out, i flip you out, i turn you out
and show you 'bout some freaky shit that you ain't never knew about
yes sir, you know i heard all about you
i'm here to re-route you, need to see what that mouth do
virgin-a-listic, imperialistic
i got a t-shirt full of your lipstick

i'm about to explode don't you miss it
a whole mouth full, don't be scared and don't be bashful
one more question that i must ask you
