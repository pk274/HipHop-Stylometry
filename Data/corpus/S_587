cruisin down the boulevard feelin hella good
smokin while i’m drivin, you would if you could
so i’ma push, smokin on this reggie bush
avoidin the p’s, steady tryin to hit it (hit it)
jesus g’s, you niggas don’t get it
and she’s a tease, you’re never gonna hit it
she say she wanna keep her clothes on
i’m not a drummer but this summer the beat goes on
i told her, let me flip this shit, then i’ll dip this shit
then i’ll hit this shit, i’m the magnificent
equivalent to no other, relevant to recover
sell that shit to your mother


knock, knock, knock-knockin'
knock, knock, knock-knockin'

busting through your speakers
busting-busting through your speakers

bust-busting through your speakers like (ugh)
feeling-feeling hella, feeling hella good
busting through your speakers like tyson's in your stereo
