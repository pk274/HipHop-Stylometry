hmm! still, i am
tighter than the pants on will.i.am
black throwback steeler hat, pound in my backpack
next to where the swishers at, smoking presidential
got some bubba, i'll give you that, need it for my cataracts
four hoes and i'm the pimp in my cadillac (where my money, bitch?)
you can tell them cali back; matter-fact, they'll know
this ain't 'dro, get a whiff of that
no, it ain't no seeds in my sack, you ain't never gotta ask, dog
"what he smokin' on?" shit, kush 'til my mind gone
what you think i'm on? eyes low, i'm blown
high as a motherfucker, yeah, ain't no questions 'bout it
niggas say, "smoke me out," yeah, i really doubt it
i'm bob marley reincarnated, so faded
so if you want it, you know your nigga, homie
you can put it in a zag or a blunt and get blunted
