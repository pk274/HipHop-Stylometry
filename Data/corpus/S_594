yeah, ha ha
ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls, players and pimps
we'd like to welcome you all to los angeles, california
yes, sir


run it down the line, sunset and vine
blow a half a zip by the hollywood sign
scotty once said "it gets better with time"
eastside long beach but this l.a. county on mines
yeah, this is the sign of the times
one of a kind, and this might blow your mind
this ain't no tv show, bow-wow-yippee-yo
standin' on your tippy-toe, nigga, here we, here we go
crenshaw boulevard, everywhеre niggas hard
left on vernon by my auntiе's front yard
no disrespect or disregard
shout out to the whole motherfuckin' crip card
dip hard, rip hard, used to poplock
you turn on the wrong street and you will get got
rules of the city like fie-fi-fo
creep slow in a '4, motherfuck five-o
