i'm from that big blue raggin', tip toe taggin'
mustard and mayonnaise, with daynas on the wagon
brown paper baggin', baby mama naggin'
you're either skinny jeans, gucci belt or straight saggin'
pleasure and agony, black james cagney
the wood is the wood, but the hood is like a cavity
so much tragedy, rarely see clarity
i'm like a heir-to-be, charity, sincerely
los angeles, scandalous, handle us how?
we the ones you get your swag from, write that down
home of the green leaf, watch out now
high school lesson, y'all can drop out now
california highway, california my way
i do it that way, then roll a fat j
la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la, look at me in my cadillac car
