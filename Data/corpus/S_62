heavenly father, i wanna thank you for what you've done for me
in my life, i try so hard to be faithful, and i am faithful to you
and my soul just running away to you, and i want you to grab my hand and hold me
i know, i know, i know
one of these days, i'm gonna run away to you
yes i am
whoah, yes i am


in the kitchen with my kinfolk, cookin'
they say the devil always show up when you're not lookin'
that's why i'm doing god's work
i'll hook 'em with the scripture
then bring it all to life so everyone can get the picture
i'm withcha (oh)
see, this is for my folks who hold the fence up
the preachers, ministers, deacons, ushers and the sisters (what?)
my granny used to say "give us our daily bread"
she put it in my heart, and now it's in my head


i'm at the park, playin' ball with the children
providing the league so i can help restore the feeling
it's a blessing to give back, so let's keep giving it
walk by faith, and showing how we livin' it (livin')
lovin' it, avoiding the hate
shout out to ruth for giving birth to nate
that's my homeboy's momma
we was raised in the church
we take god with us
do right, don't fight
or try to squab with us
no weapon formed against me shall prosper
and that's fact, truth mane
the gospel
sittin' on the corner, tryna figure the fall
you done got too high, now you're feeling so low
i'm just a nobody, tryna tell everybody
about somebody who can save anybody
i remember what my grandma said, "give us our daily bread"
it's in my heart, and my head
