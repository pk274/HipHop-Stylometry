comin' so swift and upliftin', shiftin' into gears
everybody snap, tap, clap cause this is the year
for perfection, my motherfuckin' homies
to put they shit on the map and finally get they fuckin' snaps
broke off like it was supposed to be done
niggas sayin' they weak due to the fact that one
nigga decided to leave and get his rap on elsewhere
ask me if they care and i give you a stare like no
you can't cope, they dope, but outtie
fools that follow slowly will surely become audi
5000, that's word to the d-o-g
so what i'ma do is give these niggas the m-i-c
and let them prove themselves so you can understand
that one rapper stepped and left and then ya bend him
that shit ain't right but peep game
these brothers got somethin' to prove so i'ma exchange
hand the mic from mic to hand, t-dubb the first one up
so let 'em understand


my nigga t-dubb expressed himself, oh yes he did
now it's time for the dj to put his bid in
ya thinkin' he's mixin' the mix, well your ass is wrong
glaze finna get his mothafuckin' rap on
so would whack dj's back up off the 12 gauges
give him some room, while the boom from the stage is
tripped up, flipped up, ripped up, but it's effective
understand perfection from a dj's perspective


god-diggy-di-damn glaze, you make a nigga not wanna flow
from me to you homie, hmm, they don't hear you though
but-ah let me see who's next, expressin'
is it my boy mnm, cause if it is, grab a wesson
the one that belongs to smith
don't riff or skip, just hit the spliff and shoot ya gift
until these bustas stop flexin'
mnm let 'em understand perfection


wooh shit, that was the dope stuff
but you know what they say, as it goes, it gets ruff
now it's time to get taken to the streets
so fall into the rhyme as i fall into the beat
cause comin' around the house is the g
my motherfuckin' homie tender d
he's never fakin' for breakin' em off a proper sack
maniac, brainiac, it's my nigga wayniac
villain, crook, thief, whatever you wanna name him
punk bitches, please, don't try to game him
cause if you do you know he's down for checking a hoe
in a minute you should know he's in it to win it
i done joked too much, i done spoke too much
so tender d (what up?) go 'head and fuck shit up
