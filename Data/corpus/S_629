you ready to go? iâ€™m ready to smoke (smoke some)
they ready to rock, just hit up my phone *brrr brrr*
them bones is loud, they hearin' them all (run it nigga)
you smokin' that shine, you bump in the zone
the ride is live, the power is potent
the flight go high, the coast is dope
we rollin' and smokin' the finest dough
the body is ripe, the price is low
you takin' a toke, cough, choke
you thinkin' it fast, and move too slow
you smoke with the gang, and high we go


yeah, let me talk to 'em trick
smoke mine, smoke yours like
