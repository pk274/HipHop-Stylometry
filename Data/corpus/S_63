tears fall from my eyes
tears fall from my eyes
from my eyes…
if i could only bring ‘em back
if i could only bring ‘em back
bring ‘em back… and i would

things ain’t the same, and i miss you
they say you in a better place
they say you in a better place


heaven… it wouldn’t be the same without you
wouldn’t be the same without you… my, oh my
i said heaven, it wouldn’t be the same without you
wouldn’t be the same without you… my, oh my
