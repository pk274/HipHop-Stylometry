they laid one of my homies down, two of my enemies
i grab the heat and creep up the street and squeeze
i'm in your neighborhood, so what the fuck is up?
and if i catch you i'mma pop you, nigga that's whats up!
we can talk about it, nah, i don't think so
and i'mma catch you when you're creeping with that pink toe
you tryna creep up out that mink store, get you a drink
so when i hit you, you won't even trip to think so
cross your heart, double dot your eyes
yellow tape you, make you a homicide
stretch you out like a red vine
halloween is your deadline, beddy bed time
i zag your zig, i put a fork in the pig
i cock the glock and pop you my nigga, you dig?
i open you up and leave you leaking by the face
in ghetto we ain't got no time to be catching no case
too slick, too sly, plus i'm too high
i'm too fly and i do die, i do die
i love to shoot an intruder, i mix the purp with the budda
love chicken and beer like the homeboy luda
big snoopy d-o-dub, i'mma killa cuz
i'm draped up like a steela of gorilla (dub)
sacramento no, pedal to the floor
anotha killing for realer, my nigga let it go
