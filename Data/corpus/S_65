a pool party at the church
g'd up and others barbequeing
ain't no telling what your daddy and your momma doing
chewing on these baby-backs popping bottles with these macks
everybody swimming, backyard full of women
i'm entertaining folks
gave the lil' homie twenty dollars just to shine my hundred spokes
coke with the hennesey tends to be the remedy
family and friends to me
everyone pretends to be kin to me
i can't wait until the fourth of july
to pop some fireworks with my kids
and fly some kites high in the sky
see, it's the family reunion
and down at the church house, they giving up the annual communion
it seems we made it to another summer
yeah we came and come up
213 is more than friends
yeah, we like blood brothers
riding this 'til the wheels fall off
can you dig that?
we got this summertime anthem for y'all
we did that


i'm addicted to the sunshine the way it make these women dress
tank tops, flip flops, make this nigga love the west
different spots, even though different, it's still crackin'
in jamaica, queens i sit back, live and collect the cabbage
it's an affair that every state can relate to
and if you do what i do, then go on and follow suit
from chi-town to diego, all the way back to ny
stay fly, and never miss a piece of sunshine
when i'm at the church i barbeque for my kinfolk
watch lil' elijah and lil' warren run the football
got weed, got drink, but most of all the spirit
and it's a blessin' that the world wanna hear our music
the summer is an inspiration as much as the fast
and to my my nigga snoopdewoop, i love you fam'
riding this 'til the wheels fall off
can you dig that?
we got this summertime anthem for y'all
we did that


yeah, another summer
kanye west good looking on the beat, nephew
213 reminding y'all put your guns down
real spit it's summertime, let's enjoy ourselves
we just wanna celebrate
you know what i'm talking about?
it's too hot for all that
yeah 213
moving mountains y'all haha
all the time, yeah
