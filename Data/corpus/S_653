a long way from a bowl of wheaties, we eat up
larry j, nigga, turn the beat up
we up, la coliseum, usc us
out of town niggas get beat up
we the west coast connect, quick to pick the heat up
count my stripes like nikes and adidas
street sweeper, hang dry like the cleaners
no more misdemeanors or subpoenas
three-six, so switch, kick my feet up
and chop a four to a two-seater
add that, pull him up, make him bag back
having more cheese than a fat rat
with the fat sack, with the hatchback
with a bad batch, or two plus three, that's five
that's five, here to pop a few, here to knock a new
ay, mr l.a, hit your big homie on the celly
bring dank, drank and violence
ruth chris, nigga, fuck ronald mcdonald
listened at me, and now you got a song with me
'member when you used to listen to me?
give it to me, come on


now we just came a long way
but we still got a long way (yes sir!)
we just came a long way
we done come a long way (keep goin')
we just came a long way (keep goin')
we done come a long way (keep goin')
we just came a long way (don't give up, give up)
we done come a long way (keep going, going, going)


don't give up, give up, keep going, going, going
don't you give up, give up, keep going, going, going
see, we done came a long way
and we ain't even done yet
mr. l.a., yeah, mr. l.a
that's me
you heard me
going, going, going, going, gone
you gotta lea⁠— you gotta leave room for mama, too
my mama gotta say somethin'
