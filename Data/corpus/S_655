how about that
gifts under the tree
somebody care about me
it was just another christmas
'til my daughter sent me kisses
then my feelings got up in it
now i'm down to spread the spirit
look out


my mama told me
ya might not get a gift
a man in a mutha
'cause it's already the 25th
and i ain't gotta gift yet
i'm upset, i'm ready to go steal some shh
ready to go and deal some shh
see christmas is supposed to be fun
tearin' open gifts, comparin' 'em, playin' wit your loved ones
all of my cousins, man they got everything
colecovisions, they even got a green machine
while i'm sittin' at the pad, mopin' and mad
lovin' my mama but i'm hopin' my dad come through with a big bag
tappin' on the front door
take me on a shopping spree to my favorite steez-ore (c'mon)
let me get what i want, let me get what i need
is it real? it must be a dream 'cause the hood that i come from don't believe in no santa claus
mama was santa claus, my mama was santa, dog
and i love her to death despite i might not get what i been needin'
long as i'm breathin'
see 'cause she taught be 'bout life and that's a trip
if you livin' on christmas, then that's your gift
how 'bout that?

see 'cause i'm gonna put you on my xmas list
'cause i care about it, don't worry bout it, 'cause it was rowdy get crowded, 'cause i invited everybody 'cause that's what christmas is
