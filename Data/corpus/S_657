(snoop dogg * overlapping chorus)
i was in love at times
i was so hurt, she made me forget my rhymes
i was in love at times
i was so hurt, she made me forget my rhymes
i was in love at times
they say "game don't wait" huh warren g?
well the game better wait for me
i'm spendin my time while i'm writin these rhymes
in the hills for real, sippin wines, girl you'se a dime
got me losin my mind
well if lovin you is a crime
i'm down to do my time
lock me up and throw away the key
i once told that "this was the way love was meant to be"
i see you with me forever
we can do things that you never, thought you coulda
up out the hood-uh, is where i took you, never overlooked you
i can't believe that you shook to another spot
and left me cold, now i'm hot
i'm tryin to find you, what am i to do?
i gave you everything that you needed



(snoop * over chorus)
took it for granted, shit, i'm cool now
what goes around, comes around
