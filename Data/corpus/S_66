real california gangsta is what i claim to be
but this hip hop dope spot it came to me
back tail with clientele dog bite with a lion tail
soft white boss life all kite fly as hell
cooked up zoned out wrong route
hopped out hopped in u-turn hopped out
k’s up bah bah raise up blaze up
back to the species that did take your breezy
your ho is so easy fasheezy my neezy
this real two guns four hoes trap house one whip
dope man coke head sushi with rice
velvet satin lavish the life
and if you stare if you look you’ll get took
you will be one of them hoes in my book
shabadu get revenue and i hooked up with troy avenue
and we get to this money while knockin new bitches
so vicious and that’s…..
