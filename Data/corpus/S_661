gangsta

so i keep that thang put up in the glove
especially when i walk in the club
they kiss and they hug
they push and they shove
pattin' me down, beggin' for bud

bumpin' his gums, hangin' with thugs
i'm hollerin' at girls
catfish, let me scream at you for a minute
you see baby girl over there, i'm tryin' to go up in it (yeah, bobba)
so let me slide up on it and hit it like i want it
