doggface, boss dogg
what it do? we gon' break it down
gimme the sack so i can roll back
roll up the windows, we in the 'lac
know where we goin', drank pourin'
i spilled the weed all ovеr the floor and
last blunt, so i gotta get it right
and when i do, shit, i gotta gеt a light
i tap my pockets, check my dash
and my glove box
parked the car and i checked this bitch
where's my lighter? i need a hit
dogg provokin'
locomotin'
