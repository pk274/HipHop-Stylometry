yeah, let the good times roll
snoop dogg, timati,yeah
so magical, so magical
mystical
good times, good times


woke up feeling good, born and raised in a hood
i came a long way, not what the song say?
let the good times roll, maintain the control
i’m on the black and yellow brick road to gold
the remedy, timati and me, equal double g
my life is like a fantasy, so come and join my family
cheers inflexing dips and whips
and all types of fun stuff when you’re taking a buff
so actual, magical, mystical
get yourself together cause we’re fist to blow
ready to go, set to flow
let it go, we’re so incredible, i’m telling you
have a look outside, the sun is out
plain blue sky, now we gonna ride
la da ti da ta
no time to waste, we’re back in the place
turn it up as we bounce and ball, ball


you know it’s magical (magical)
it’s so incredible (incredible)
the things that i can do
to make my dreams come true (come true)
i got no time to waste
so we can fly away
and the good times roll
let the good times roll, baby
