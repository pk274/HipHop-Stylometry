"okay, gangsters, put your hands behind your head, interlock your fingers, get down on your knees, let's go. cross your ankles, don't move."

i, used to be a hard head
mobbin' round, half dead
sippin' silver satin while we smoked on the pin head
a couch was a nigga bed
mary kept a nigga fed
twenty first a nigga, yeah that's where a nigga live
i'm on the ga and fuck the d.a
why? 'cause they railroaded the homie, easy
and just cause the didn't know what (what's up)
i'm on a motherfuckin' mission to come up, come up


when doggy dogg comes
(i feel like givin' it up
we all like livin' it up)
you better answer
(i feel like givin' it up
we all like livin' it up)

verse 2
we are living in a world
where anything can go at anytime
and if you ain't up on the game
then i suggest you rearrange
'cause change gone come
and it ain't waitin' on no one
they got me plottin' from the bottom
with the cotton, ain't no stoppin'
and all i want for christmas is forty city hoppin'
is the to much to ask fo', oh no
and i heard it through the eastside, you was finna to get some dough
so when you get your funk, don't take it to the store
take it to daddy rap cause he's a pro-fessional
guaranteed to get your shit up off the flo'
beach city rider you know, fo sho'
you see, that's what flossin' is all about
the tightest rider gone turn it out
bouncin', swerving and looking cute
dogg pound out the moon, johnny law in pursuit


when doggy dogg comes
(i feel like givin' it up
we all like livin' it up)
you better answer
(i feel like givin' it up
we all like livin' it up)

everybody in my family is nervous and waitin'
how can i be patient?
look at what i'm facin'
they ain't the ones that gonna be riding to the station
so what it all boils down to-- just some inspiration
interpretation, the conversation you had with the judge
of all judges budge this
and put it in perspective all praises due, true
we are living in a world
where anything can go at anytime
and if you ain't up on the game
then i suggest you rearrange
cause change gone come
and it ain't waitin on no one
for all the drama i done went through
to get this to ya
how do i think i was gon' do ya?
have you been mislead, since i asked you all to creep with me
you couldn't be, 'cause ever since it's been d.p
l.b.-b.s. chronic in my chest
death row, doggystyle, holding down the west
with a shot of what gangstas drink
and a toke off for the choke off, the most kept my g's off, a toast
and keep l.b.c. singing y'all, d.p.g.-in', ya'll
we in ya'll face at all times, livin' it up
snoop dogg again, and you know i'm just givin' it up


when doggy dogg comes
(i feel like givin' it up
we all like livin' it up)
you better answer
