let me get that intro
blunts, gators
hand me my mink


on the east duckin' feds from a peephole
1989, gangbangin' was at its peak
this the beat that make me reminisce on g-funk
three summers before the chronic hit the streets
i would rather slang hand to hand to a fiend
rappin' on the side, trappin' was priority
but every now and then i go scoop my little thing
pull up in my mc bangin' new jack swing
ooh, summertime time back in long beach
passin' one bottle, 40 oz. o.e
i didn't have a dollar but a nigga had a dream
whippin' over the stove and a nigga gotta eat
threw my raps in the garbage, fuck bein' a mc
thank the lord for nate dogg and thank god for warren g
funny how time flies when you're high as me
