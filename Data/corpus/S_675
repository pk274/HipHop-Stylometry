i'mma gangsta, located in the alleys and cali
shoot dice wit' killas and smoke wit' the dealers
you can't tell me shit 'bout these streets homey
i don' seen it and done it and lived the real from the phony
out for this money, homies maintain they composure
since kids on the streets sellin' dope by the police
now i'mma a soldier muthafucka for the chips
when i dips the trips, gp straight for dp
but the scripts how mama raised me
pops wasn't home, left us all alone
wasn't no thang, cause my mama had game
she showed me everythang except how to be a man
i understand, for all the streets and the jail time i caught
the pain i brought, that wasn't what you taught
it's probably pops fault how i ended up
gangbangin', crack slangin', not given' a fuck
two strikes in my life, a nigga fed up
mama said don't let up, and baby boy keep your head up
