let me talk to 'em, nephew
ricky is tricky, the game is gettin’ slippery
this shit is a maze, cuz singing like a tempree
i disappear for one minute ‘til they miss me
another tv show, more dough, i’m makin’ history
now i'm back at your service
wish me luck dear, i’m scared and i'm nervous
you never left you brought that hood back with ya
i'm the real deal, i ain't gon' bullshit with ya
another one i wanna make, another joint i wanna make
open the oven put some candles on my cake
twenty-five and countin’, etch my face into kushmore mountain
can’t be scared of your opponent dog-gone it if you want it, trip this
this sucker shit is running rampant, it’s the moment i fear
