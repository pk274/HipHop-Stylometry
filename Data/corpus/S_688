i know you probably never gon' see like
you never had a nigga from the hood with that d like
california, baby, so you know just what we like
walk that, talk that, nigga, that g life
trunk full of gas usually in my backpack
run up on that dawg and i rat-tat-tat-tat-tat
seven deuce caprice, the paint job's a beast
cruisin' through the city with your mama or your niece
on the eastside, we ride the most, pick-and-roll
then we slide to post, stay fly but grab a toast
you better recognize
jeremih and t.i., we collectivize
rectify, outstanding
premeditated, never reprimanded
in the mask lookin' like a bandit
jettin' in my jet to another planet, that's how i planned it
off we go, cause you got what i want
so i'm givin' you what you need
so stop playin' with me (playin' with me) get in with a boss
and buckle up 'cause we about to take off, yessir
