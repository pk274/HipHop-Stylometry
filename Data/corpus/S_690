yeah, lil' homie
recognize game when it's in your face
elevate, educate, motivate (dig)


ride, ride, rippedy ride
let me tell you lil' some 'bout pride (wow)
slide, slide, slippedy slide
and i'ma take you for a walk on the wild side
hold down, slow down, graduate
the way you move it, you'll catch a case
'cause i know that what's at stake
all work and no play
boy, you better not diss that class
spit that fast, you better go and get that cash
oh, you like being a fool, packing a tool
boy, you better get in school
how you think that i got mine?
you better read between the lines
yeah, 'cause life ain't fair
you better get up, get out and go, get there
motivate
