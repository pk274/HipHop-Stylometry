ro-ro-romeo, ro-ro-romeo
ro-ro-romeo, ro-ro-romeo
s-n-double-o
and i'm gon' be your romeo


the wrong way (yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah)
looks like the right way (yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah)
let the media paint the picture
then we gonna rip it out the frame
a peep show (oh)
has never been so profitable (ooh, yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah)
show ya ass and i'll spank it, the cash and i'll take it
and we can watch it blow


take me wickedly, give me body (oh, oh)
show m–µ the end of the rainbow


ro-ro-romeo, ro-ro-romeo
camera's on


a whirlwind of sex and watered down gin (yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah)
the competition of one's ambition
let's see who can bring the racks in
we french kiss (how did it taste?)
with mr. benjamin's kids (ooh, yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah)
stay up 'til five for the 50s, stock 'em and cop a bentley
bring the big wigs


light a candle, set the tone
lights, action, camera's on
me and you in a foreign place
chocolate dog, how'd it taste?
whip it out, lay you down, kiss your neck, rub you down
turn up the music right about now
shake that thing and show me how you get down
i can get you what you like, i know just what you need
nice and tight, slice and dice
the price is right and you can have this life
this how i live, bada-bing, yada-ding
s-n-double-o
and i'm gon' be your romeo


ro-ro-romeo (mr. romeo), ro-ro-romeo (mr. romeo)
romeo
