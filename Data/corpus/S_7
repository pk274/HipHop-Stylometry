aye yo goldie loc, remember that shit we did about two years ago cuz, called "20 minutes"? we drove the hood crazy with that shit

ask me this nigga, what's twenty-two minus two?
matter of fact, what's fifteen plus five?
or ten times two?
you know what time it is


i pour a bowl of wheaties in my bowl, it's cold
and then i jump up in my brougham, sittin' on daytons and bone
so i'm heading to the city of the l.b.c
one-five, block four of the r.t.c
two-owe, you know, me and loc big smoke
we pimp these hoes, while i bang on these chongos
don't make me act like a motherfuckin' fool
i know these niggas way back, but they act cool

long beach, so deep, nigga why you talkin' cheap?
we be c-walkin', stalkin', hawkin', walkin' in the streets
beeper freak, bump the beat, keep the heat on the seat of the benz
get some ends, call some friends here we go again

i'm saggin' so hard, my shorts look like pants
i write my own raps and i do my own dance
stretch more, bullet wound, t-shirts, county fool
you know we crip'd it, that long beach attitude

gat at you? nigga, i ain't mad at you
but if you poppin' that shit, that's what i gotta do
there that fool, had a nigga tell me, told me homie said the dubb was soft
so i had to blow his motherfuckin' face off
you motherfuckers can't even crip on your own two
i got somethin' for her, him and you
talk the talk, walk the walk, fuck what you see-zay
catch your mama slippin', while she trynna sell these low days


long beach niggas is the craziest
especially them eastside twenty crips
two, fours hoes and shows
these bitches only fuckin' with the real two owes

so now i really know why you niggas act hard
scared fools out of their atlantic farms
big willie get silly, hit with the mac-millie
bellin' with my two heats, call a nigga billy

half-gate mass straight in the a-top back
doggy dogg is a mark, motherfucker stop that
y'all knew from the getty how we do in the city
where the grass is greener, and the crips are much meaner

i do my own trippin', while you lookin' for a set-up
catch him at the "dead light" and get that ass wet up
and watch your fat friend
get beat up again, we got streets hot on this black and gold bend

godlie loc, stay on one, while i stay gone two
brownies in my pocket, click it, cock it, knock it
drop it, pop it, pop it
doghouse motherfucker, you can't stop it


long beach niggas is the craziest
especially them eastside twenty crips
two, fours hoes and shows
these bitches only fuckin' with the real two owes

talkin' shit, bumpin' lips'll get you fucked up bitch
now you know about these long beach hogs
don't fuck with goldie loc or the homie snoop dogg

now if i put that on something, i'ma come through dumpin'
most likely withÂ  the four-fifth heat
i say up jump the boogie to the bang bang boogie
owes up, this is r.t.c
i throw a fit, i take your bitch, i hit a switch and hit that g-shit
dubs up, please believe it
black, gold, gold and black
back on the map
