big snoop dogg with a yellow paris hiny
with two girlies in the back in they crip blue bikinis
shakin and they jumpin cause the duece keep bouncin
tippin, whippin, the ass steady dippin
candy paint drippin and these axels want a sippin
as i shake like a dice game cold as the ice age
mike jones rockin like a rolling stone
it's snoop dogg boy, i’m b-b-bad to the bone
yea them cali boyz, we love them low lows
an real car club niggas bang they logos
and take photos, see everything is fine
i'm in the sixty-four or sixty-tre, or fifty-nine
i love my car, like i love my wife
see lowridin ain't a sport it's a way of life
on the real doe i'll tell you how i feel doe
if you see me in the fo’ creepin slow yo


yeah man, let me explain somethin' to you one time, man
low ridin′ is not a sport, it′s a way of life
it's like buildin' a car from scratch, you understand me
you gotta put the fresh paint on it
you gotta put the mustard and mayonnaise
that's the tires, you understand me?
you gotta put the chrome on it
a little gold on it, you understand me
it's gotta be a hundred spokes or better, ya dig?
an′ you gotta drop the top
you gotta put the switches on the motherfucker
you definitely got to have a beat
and when you hit the streets you gotta have a freak
you know what i'm sayin′? one of the side, two on the b-sack
that's how it′s gotta go down man
that's real lowridin, you understand me
from a west coast motherfuckin' g man
we bouncin', we schlippin′, we tippin′, we dippin'
we dodgin′ motherfuckin' pigs all the while
while we doin′ this motherfuckin' gangsta style
you understand what i′m sayin', yeah i'm just cruisin′
