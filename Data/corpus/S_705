got you feelin' real good, 'bout to walk you to the hood
where the stealers and the raiders keep it goin' at (goin')
and the bubblegum kush is what we blowin' back (blowin' back)
we slide by nip's spot and pick up some t-shirts (crenshaw)
then buy a few bags from the homies, that's called network
catch a quick flick and then we dip out (dip out)
i put a dub in the air, that means i'm rollin' twenty crip out
slip out, trip out, until my headphones slip
i'm with my kinfolk, crip, we ought to get more chips
