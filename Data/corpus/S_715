(my life, my life, my life, my life)
oh, another day to play
(my life, my life, my life, my life)
(my life, my life, my life, my life)
dam funk take me away
(my life, my life, my life, my life)


in my life time, in my life time
i gon' get mines, oh yeah
living the gangsta life
in the life time
drinking and smoking yeah
in my life time


fish don't burn in the kitchen
and beans don't burn on the grill
gs don't turn nor squeal
took a whole lot to get up that hill
but a lotta homies got popped and peeled
copped the steel, two-one glock in the building
two in a million probably a billion
nobody can feel you
wait for the moment to brake
cause i know a lot of niggas want a piece of my cake
here's a candle, now blow on it
i got the eight, seven, six, five, four on it
make up the price, shake up the dice
i'm tryna get rich overnight despite
four or five killers on the spot that are mad
whoopin the back, rockin the sack
walk in the back, cockin' it back
cause i don't know who to trust
i'm with them, six-one boys yelling "east side buck"


in my life time, in my life time
i gon' get mines, oh yeah
living the gangsta life
in the life time
drinking and smoking yeah
in my life time


in my life time, in my life time
i gon' get mines, oh yeah
living the gangsta life
in the life time
drinking and smoking yeah
in my life time


in my life time, in my life time
i gon' get mines, oh yeah
living the gangsta life
in the life time
drinking and smoking yeah
in my life time
in my life time, in my life time
i gon' get mines, oh yeah
living the gangsta life
in the life time
drinking and smoking yeah
in my life time
in my life time, in my life time
i gon' get mines, oh yeah
living the gangsta life
in the life time
drinking and smoking yeah
in my life
