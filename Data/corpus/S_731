new york, new york big city of dreams
and everythin' in new york ain't always what it seems
you might get fooled if you come from outta town
but i'm down by law, and i'm from tha dogg pound

it's the incredible, the lyrical
you can't be me, like niecey, to see me, it's gonna take a miracle
i'm drivin' muthafuckaz hysterical
wit' a touch of this twister (uh huh), stylistic mixture (ahh)
what i create pulsates, there is no escape
annihilate ya mental mind state
they labels my vocabulary abusive (ahhh)
i packs more knowledge than confucius
i'm deadly! (ahh) induce ya like medusa, wit' thoughts to share
to niggas throughout this hemisphere, far and near (ahh)
prepare! catch me chillin' like the winter
up against the number one contender as i enter
'cause i gets heated like friction
muthafuck your whole jurisdiction
react this fact, not fiction telepathic addiction (ahh)
to this homicidal recital, dangerous and vital to all my rivals
suicidal brainwaves conveys
through the average muthafuckaz' minds these days
i'm all ready to put work in
take ten steps and turn to shoot the first nigga smirkin'
give a fuck whatcha name (name)
whatcha claim (claim), or why ya came
muthafucka, don't explain! (don't explain)
simply, don't tempt me
'cause i'm simply layin' hoes like smpte
(who am i? who am i?) the invincible mc



new york, new york big city of dreams
and everythin' in new york ain't always what it seems
you might get fooled if you come from outta town
but i'm down by law, and i'm from tha dogg pound
too much, i serve too many people, too much
it's too much, i serve too many people
and when i finish servin', ain't gon' be no sequel
