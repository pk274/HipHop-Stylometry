i'm born and raised in the 2-1-3, the 3-1-0
the 5-6-2, but now i represent the 5-0-4
for sure, see ain't no limit to this
we do it up all night and we keep it trump tight
do what we have to, it will be a tragedy
tell 'em quit fucking with your dawg magic
shit, i'm bout to get drastic on they bitch ass
and send all  your fake ass soldiers to a casket fast
on the dip up state, holler at my homeboy
hook it out, on the homie billy bathgate
now heres a toast to the coast where they represent the most
gangsterish niggas i know get the money and then they get ghost
and slide to another location
living downsouth, in the house, for my summer vacation
i'm blasting on sight, i'm ashing all night
and ain't no limit till i get my motherfucking paper right

(chorus)
i'm from the motherfucken n-o l-i-m-i-t
you niggas can't fuck with me (4x)
