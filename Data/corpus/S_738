there is no one else like you
in spite of all the things i do
to the most high, i salute
'cause there is no one else

no matter what the case is
the mountains that i'm facin'
your love it never changes, i know
there is no one else like you


you're the alpha and omega
the beginning and the end
before anyone else
you're my closest friend
when times got hard
he was always there for me
when satan thought he had me bound
you were there to set me free
yes, you were, lord




searched high and low
i gotta take you wherever i go
look around, there's only one
i know, i know, (listen)
but, lord, you lifted me
now i'm walking on higher ground
i ain't got to worry about tomorrow
as long as you right next to me




(no one else, no one else)
been around the world
(no one else, no one else)
can't find nobody
(no one else, no one else)
nobody, nobody
oh oh my lordy
oh, my lord
oh yeah, gonna be alright
yes, it is
