fresher than fresh
yes i'm the best
no pressure nonetheless -
one might contest
until they figure out
this nigga 'bout -
knockin' the bitch
gettin' this brick
taking a trip
and having a sip
i made your girl want to skinny dip
when she seen me
rub my nuts three times, made your bitch a genie
she made my dick disappear then reappear, do it down
gave it to her best friend, lube it down
see i don't even know where i'm at (but we smokin'!)
somewhere in nova scotia, canada, bustin' the mack
you see
pimpin' ain't got no restrictions
i'm your dj while i'm stayin' in the mixin'
fixin' the batch
i woke up with a bad bitch in my lap, my nigga
cause i'm cool like that
see it's a monday, a fun day, and one day i'll quit
but until then, my nigga, we gon' just get lit


cause  it's the weekend
on the west coast (west coast, baby!)
got a little crazy last night
woke up in the back seat
of a row boat
no clothes, no phone, comatose
i guess i dove off
of the deep end
now i'm just paying the price
high cost of living
guess you get what you give in
no pressure, no diamonds
no-no pressure, no
no pressure, no
no pressure, no diamonds
no-no pressure, no
no-no pressure, no
no pressure, no diamonds
