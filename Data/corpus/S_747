none my niggas ever snitched on a nigga
ever told on a nigga but we stole on a nigga
pop two shots for the worst lockdown
'cause the shit's getting hot on the block right now
a lotta niggas don't know, bust with the 44
took his whole stack, now back with the coco
cookin' it up, peepin', lookin' and cookin' it up
i plan for the worst, stick the bitch up with the bands in the purse
then i get away, no one seen a thing
shut your mouth or kiss the beam
race supreme like a new york nigga
get you clipped off, i'm a new york nigga
wall renounce, bust you down
without a sound, that's how i get down
and dirty, fly 'round with it, birdy
touch my first 25 mill' when i turn 30
ya heard me? and i'm still gettin' money homie
nigga don't run up on me
'cause that'll be
take ten steps and battle me
turn, face and draw
all you saw was holopoints at yo' motherfuckin' jaw

nigga talkin' shit, got shot in his motherfuckin' face
they ask me what i saw, i ain't seen a motherfuckin' thang
what i look like, news nigga?
moved nigga? used nigga?
hoes, the game's to be sold
not to be told, "for once to behold."
game with aggression, oppression
life is a lesson
don't fuck with cuz, if he thinkin', talkin' or guessin' (snitch)
close your trap, in my area, we'll bust yo' gap
hold you back from takin' a stand
being a bitch and pointin' out your mans
that's some hoe shit we don't fuck with
this ain't made for all
nigga, not y'all, just my dawgs
the game bang-related, non-negotiated
real as fuck, the bitch niggas hate it, so what?
blaze up, pour up, know what?
we gettin' fucked up
for all the real niggas worldwide, that ain't never snitch
think that a bitch?
