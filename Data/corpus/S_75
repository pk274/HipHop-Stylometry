out to the walk of stars now you in cali
don’t go ‘less you go hard
go ‘less you go hard

hollywood, downtown and back
life is always good
it’s not an act we so fresh, so hood
you knew that it never would
knew that it never would

southern surfer cali


rollin’ down fairfax
just left the nico, bust a left turn on pico
gotta see the bishop, he got me some gator shoes
i’m rollin’ to hollywood, i’m doing the house of blues
about 9 o clock stop by the record shop
and get that new snoop dogg, now we bouncing ball
life is a mystery, my life is like history
stop by my dispensary
give me some kush and pusha
put it in the trunk, smelling like some skunk
but it’s all legal in la
everybody taking a hit from the politicians
athletes and even the teachers

he say “snoop dogg i really wanna meet ya”
yeah, i love showing you now
first things first, my nig’ you better know where you at
