the club is packed, i rap the rap
ladies are in here from front to back
and they love my soul, i reply:
baby girl, don't you know that i am the fly?
hands in the sky, don't ask why!
party on down with a big bow wow!
i got style, got flare, got you right there
i got enough stock to make you do that dance
so come one, come all, just havin' a ball
be aware of the owner, 'cause the owner's a dogg!
i got y'all back off the wall


i like the way that you talk
i like the way that you walk (body)
crash! boom! bang! you're so beautiful (oh my god)
wait till we kiss
give me your lips (body)
crash! boom! bang! you're so beautiful


baby, baby wanna be my lady?
let's take a ride in my blue mercedes
green grass, sitting on the beanbag
close your eyes so that the dream lasts
no fadin' away, just blaze the j
night will turn to amazing day
you and i, i and you
let's do what lovers do (do-do-do–)
do that dance, so do that– do that dance
do that dance, so do that– do that dance
do that dance, so do that– do that dance


i like the way that you talk
i like the way that you walk (body)
crash! boom! bang! you're so beautiful (oh my god)
wait till we kiss
give me your lips (body)
crash! boom! bang! you're so beautiful


woah (oh my god)
woah
i'm gonna give you everything you want
