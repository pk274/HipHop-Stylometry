guess who's back, it ain't a fuckin' question
they know the name, bow in the presence of a living legend
fuck what you heard, it's murda murda, you gon need protection
some niggas blinded, couldn't see
so look for me to come and give direction
who hold the crown, it ain't no conversation
iâ€™m being modest should be silent 'less you payin' homage
remain the hottest, niggas can't stop us, that's just being honest
and makin' hits, i never had problems much in that department
don't get me started, don't compare me to the newest nigga (oh-oh no!)
for every one of you, there's a hundred more
and i watch them come and go, my track record ain't coincidental
and these verses is like hearses
consistently killin' y'all with instrumentals
tell me, fuck what would y'all do without me?!
kill yourself for even thinking something crazy 'bout me
i'm like ali, your fuckin' champ, now watch me rope a dope
just watch him choke, cause everythin' i drop is dope
now watch 'em all go up in smoke
