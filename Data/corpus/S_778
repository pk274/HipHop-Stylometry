let me get a fifth of celandia
plate of some candy
cindy, sandy, mindy, mandy
tina, brandy, keisha, angie
man we, can we, all get a long
two shots of patron
i did it till the break of dawn
big fish in the pond, runnin' my triathalon
doggy dogg, keep the bomb
one of a kind, blow yo mind just like einstein
blow and shine
i'm gettin mine, prime time like 21
get 'er done, everything in my life i make it look like fun
every day of my life, i'm tryin' to get my buzz on
cuz on, some on other shit, i'm keepin' it on the under, bitch
so much pain i over came, same thing
me and 40 and game came from the same gang
but you wouldn't understand
i'm populatin' wit my weakest translation
that's my main mane, let me hit that damn thang
