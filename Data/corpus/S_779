feeling so alone...and deserted
people standing all around you
you walk around (hey)
with a fake smile on your face
cuz you don't nobody to know what you're going through (nooo)
but your weeping may endure for a night
but your joy is coming in the....morning
but you weeping may endure for a night
but your joy is coming (ohhhh)


pain
pain
god knows about your pain (ohhhh)
pain
pain
god knows all about your pain


feeling so alone...and deserted
people stand all around you
walk around
head up with foolish pride
cuz you don't want nobody to know what you're going through (ohhhh)
but your weeping may endure for a night
but your joy is coming in the....morning
but your weeping may endure for a night
but your joy comes in the morning!

comes in the morning
morning
(oh yeah)
it comes in the morning
