mack a hoe and turn her out, work her from the parking lot
give her all she ever need, i see you around the clock
never let her tell me no, keep her on that main track
baby got that bang bang, my nigga gucci mane back
makin' money, talkin' shit, is all a nigga wanna do
plenty bitches in the club, waitin' to see what i'ma do
roll it up, and pour it out, drink that shit until it fall
don't matter, smoke shatter, blowin' money at the mall
cake batter, hundred stacks
we just making flapjacks
if we blow it all, don't matter my nigga
we gon' make that shit right back
floatin' like a submarine
flying like a g6
gucci called the lion, cause he know i keep that g-shit
