	
life in the projects
where it's hard to get by
but you got it cuz your spot's gettin' hotter
life in the projects
where grass is cheese and cheese is power
life in the projects
where you got to have the will to know how
know how to do what?  survive
life in the projects
you got to get yours cuz i'ma get mine

life in the projects, goodness grief
everybody waitin' on the 1st and 15th
the police man is tryin' to get atcha
catcha, snatcha, open up your fridge
nuttin' lookin' back atcha
so you open up your freeza and say 'god, please'
i wish we had some more of this government cheese
i'm duckin' buckshots, see, walkin' on my knees
ain't no trees, the grass ain't green
and when i say it's all bad, you know what i mean
there's one in every family- what?  a fiend
and a basketball star with no team, no dreams
remember good times?  jj and michael?
and all the lil' thangs they went through despite
nobody in the projects gave a fuck
ain't no good, it's all badluck, shucks, shoppin' poppin'
back up on all the scene, from the george down, pj's, cali or projects
and the cabrini greens, my niggas get wild on they ass
we like to pow-pow on they ass
here's a toast to the coast, so take a blast
]from the projects to the upper deck, upper class
a long way from where i come from
i know where i'm at, nigga, i can't forget where i came from
