past interference, perseverance
now let me say this clearly 'cause i needs no clearance
do you have insurance
for you and your children?
i say that i don't just to make an appearance
i'm standing tall, on the ball leanin' back
black power, loc, i'm tryna bring the meaning back
seems like a wish away
chillin' like a villain on the corner
with a burner in the pickle plane
freeze tag? nah nigga, ease back
sackin' up the peeznack of the creeznack in the beezack
or maybe it's the freezer
we gettin' money on the spot where we g's, huh?
and we never gon' slip up
until we get the whole zipper, tipper, crip or, die
until the sun rise up to the stars
county jail bars, beats and breaks
and you know when the night fall...
