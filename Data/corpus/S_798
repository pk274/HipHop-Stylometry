mommy bad enough, i let her fly it
keep a pistol in the glove compartment
in a tinted rolls-royce, spillin' kush crumbs, sippin' gin and oj
seen you pull up in the porsche lookin' more free than a new divorc√©e
we ain't gotta go overseas, i can walk you 'round, through the lb
i can teach you how to fly it, as long as i'm the first one to ride it
baby, when we get to soarin'
flyin' over california
cinematic movie score
pack ya bags and get on board
we can go to places abroad
think about a getaway with the dogg
we ain't even gotta leave the resort
you can roll another bleez if you want
