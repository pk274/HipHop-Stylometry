original, a lot of style, boom-pow
blowin' on the pound, wha-pa-pa-pa-pow
way up in the cloud, misbehave your flave'
now let me show you how to maintain (go)
it's a stain as i crush game
smooth as silk, with a little bit of kush, mane
plushtane, lavish livin'
bust on the pigs with bad intentions
smoke dope, bro for bro, diango
the homie said, "9-1-1 is a joke"
and i believe that, so i protect this earth
every nigga on the block has my word
cadillac drivin', stack at the bible
listen to the sounds of the sirens, i'm an og nigga on a mission
fiends gon' burn in the kitchen, i'm twistin' while dippin'
and crippin' (crippin')


don't let me go (and let me show you how)
oh, no, no, oh, please don't let us go
i wanna know
why do you wanna go?
oh, baby, please don't go, go, go, go, go


go
let it go, let it go, let it go (yeah, yeah, that's right)
go
let it go, let it go, let it go (listen to the sounds of the sirens)
oh
let it go, let it go, let it go (yeah, yeah, that's right)
don't wanna go
oh, baby, please don't go, go, go, go, go
