bongo bytheway


mula, fetti, you not ready
i'ma get the cheese, put the bread with spaghetti
letty said he can play with them broads
opportunistic, i stay on them hoes
i ain't got time to be hanging with y'all
'specially when there is no money involved
joint seem mighty long, red beam on his dome
point seen, money gone


robert de niro, fly as a sparrow
profit to profit, arrow to pharaoh
live bueno, hustle like maino
all money in, no drano
can't no-body get it like i get mines
more paper to jamaica, i make it, bake it, shape it and cake it
remake it, never had to fake it to make it
just put the pedal to the metal, rock it up and re-flake it
i'm living the fast life
jet after jet and tryna keep my cash right
i know you understands the meaning
hand full of green and while the fans keep fiending
straight up, no leaning, i'm right where the chips at
or even in the hood where the crips at
joint seem mighty long, red beam on his dome
point seen, money gone


all right now, i need passion to the stage
i need destiny, maliah, passion
and i'ma be right there, right where my cash be
i need y'all to the stage, let's go
yeah, yeah
i need y'all on the stage, let's go
work (work, work)


in a white ghost sipping holy water
always been the type to get it close to border
after play, barry bonds, out the park
i got hits, what you mean? i throw the dart
at the wall, off the wall, i feel like mike
i don't miss, niggas talkin' shit, say i
took his bitch, hit that pussy, it took one night
hit that hoe quit, it was just aight
uhh, not at all
i ain't get to see the wall, i copped 'em all
fucked it all, fuck the law, fuck you thought?
i ain't change, seen my chain look like the car
flash man, flashy dancing, dancing on me
dirty dancing, dancing like my double cup
lemonade to niggas that be talking tough
say you got money, i just double up
multiply, fuck addition, fuckin bitches all night
macauley culkin, rich and riches
this the life, they walk away, it's so delicious
up in dubai, sushi, hella bitches
aw man, wrote a check, two commas
please tell em' i need two shots by two o' clock
plus that adds about two thousand, two drops
pull up in my crew, sellin' out
