there once was a kid by the name of dave
who stayed in the mix and never ever obeyed
he paid no attention to the shit that was taught to him
always stay strapped for the shit that was brought to him
this nigga was a motherfuckin’ fool
only 13, fuckin’ bitches in high school
laid back, his game was trump tight
he was chillin’ in the day time, clockin’ at night
makes me wanna holla cause the dollar he kept
as he grows in his game, going step by step
to the status of an al capone, mr. big 6 in the game of bones
but you know what they say. what goes up must come down
so just peep what i speak as you focus to the sound


a little bitty nigga by the name of dave
who was known through the hood cuz he misbehaved
but when the cavi got plucked it was time to get paid
sack his shit out in dumps, now he’s on his way


mischievous and devious, that’s how his life was
puttin' they swerve down a cavi just to keep the pluck of bud
some of the money making motherfuckers from the other side
was thinking ‘bout a jack move tryna hoo ride
gettin' jealous cuz my nigga got the dope game sewn up
them niggas tried to trip, biddy biddy back, they got blown up
blown up a lot, you could still get shot
you don't never play a motherfucker out for his knot
rule number 1 pay attention to the shit
don't be fuckin’ with them little niggas, they ain’t to be fucked with
kept getting it on to the break of dawn
now he’s known for serving more than i own
he’s got a 187 on his motherfuckin’ chest
a strap in his lap and a bulletproof vest
lookin’ for the niggas from the night before
so he can blast they ass but he don’t know they at his back door


dave on a mission out to set trip
but one of his homies is a motherfuckin’ snitch
some nigga named mick from around the way
they said we’ll give you 20 g’s if you show us where he stay


a dude named dave caught up in the drive-by
tears from his mother, watchin’ her son die
set trippin, somebody slippin’, bullets zippin’
dave gone for good, now his moms is flippin’
no need for crying nor dying dave is dead
point blank, he took a 9 slug to the head
davey, the wannabe gangsta from the hood
he wasn’t that bad and he wasn’t that good
all he understood was get crazy blitz
so he bought some of that to get some of this
this got him back but that went to them
them being they who made his head lay
he didn’t obey he said he made this cash
crash from the gun, dave lies in ash
smash, it hits the front page quick
now business is conducted by that fool named mick
mick, fell for the trick and he’ll be dyin’ and his moms will be cryin’
