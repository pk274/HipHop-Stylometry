i get my focus, then ride, i put some hen in my life
i get my pen and my pie
man, i drift when i drive
i feel the breezes i breeze, i got the keys to my boat
ain't that a bitch, motherfucker, say the dogg on coke
i sold coke my whole life, i never snort that shit
see i'm a ex-gangbanger, you can quote that shit
i'm livin'
everyday like thanksgivin'
i watch my big homey tookie get murdered in prison
now i can't sit back
i gotta spit that rap
i hit the streets with this heat, i got some cases to beat
i ain't bitchin'
nigga snitchin'
they think i'm crippin'
and trippin' and flippin'
but trip this
you know i'm dippin'
with the bulletproof, tucked in a snub
i got the streets on lock
and now i'm up in the club
thy kingdom come
thy will be done
thirteen years
later, motherfucker, and i'm still number one

repeat chorus


this old man, yeah, he sure can
d-o-double g with twenty mil in his hand
i stand tall, against the wall, i'm gonna ball and i'll walk it off
my favorite shows to watch, on the phone, i don't really talk at all
from the valley lowes of clarksdale
i'm gangsta, gangsta like avon barksdale
you know the word is out
he's on the loose
i'm back in the hood again, sippin' on that gin & juice
superman got dressed in the phone booth
wha-wha-what, what you gon' do, my niggas is on you
see i was all about peace to your way
you motherfuckin' mouth, tell the police, now it's on
yeah
my gangsta boots is laced up
i came here to shoot this motherfuckin' place up
don't play no games, don't say no names
don't do nothin', get popped in your motherfuckin' brain

repeat chorus twice
