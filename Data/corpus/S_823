bendin' the curb swervin', blowin' on some izz-erb
the boss has returned, i'm still flyer than a bizz-ird
ridin' and rollin' with them steelers like i'm pittsburgh
go against the gang the man will have your whole clique served
nice with the mic thang, the hoes love my pipe game
put it in the hole all night, i got nice aim
snoop dogg nigga, how many times i got to show ya?
you don't wanna see this loc'ster calvin broadus from the shoulders
so, just get your rap on, that i never slacked on
ho, you got your strap out, here we get our jack on
dick you hoes can snack on, you and your whole crew
i'll pull out my nine, now do what you hoes do
di-di-di-dogg pound, i came to break it down
god bless my pimp bone, gettin' my ego trip on, fool
ease back before i trip on you-uh, flip on you-uh
and have them hollows rip on through ya, boy


still tokin', title holdin'
desert eagle .45 totin', leave a niggas brain broken
still loc'n, still potent
still trippin', still tippin', yeah i'm still focused
and i'm still flippin', words, do it like ki's for g's
we swerve-swerve across seas gettin' cheese with ease
i'm still tallin' and, still ballin'
dumb bitches still callin', foes still fallin'
still bustin' a ho, still gettin' bucks out a ho
bitch get outta line i put my chuck's on her throat
still hittin' switches, still gettin' riches
still the best in the game, i'm still hittin' pitches
so, what it do? i'm still at you
i ain't forgot about the past 'cause, it still be fool
gangsta shit, niggas get to ego grippin'
it's snoop dogg and i present to y'all ego trippin'
