swish! 24, thats black mamba
snoop dogg, he's a dope rhymer
collaborates, with the golden state
in a yellow six deuce with the purple plates
i dip and dodge, i hit 3 and roll
fish and chips, bounce pass down to pau gasol
we don't give a damn about the big 3
la lake show we bout to 3 peat
and you can bet, thats on the set
ron artest about to get wet
i'm on the flo' and thats a fact
sittin' next to uncle jack blazin' up the purple sack
