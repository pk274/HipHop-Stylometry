(haan) my whole life been based on that pimp shit
(haan) no movie, just money, real pimp shit
(haan) more cities, more bitches, real slick shit
(haan) my maybach, it matches my outfit, that pimp shit


keepin' my tool, this shit so cool, rule number one, ain't no rule
swallow my lines, follow my grind, rich white bitch with a bottle of wine
word to the wise, word to mine, bird to fly, certified
murder eye, dirty di', never had black but she heard of mine
d-o-dub, i done it all, 20 years i bang and ball
'9-1, i had a lexus nigga, ate seafood for breakfast nigga
caught a few cases in texas nigga, do kush-ups 'til my chest get bigger
i press a nigga 'til i get it all, real shit bitch i really do ball
i am the west to y'all, taught y'all how to invest and ball
best of all, took it on the chest for y'all, that's why i get more than the rest of y'all
it's bad enough i entertain, add it up, gang bang
gat 'em up, slang cane, bag it up, same thang


(haan) my whole life been based on that pimp shit

i bang and ball, i does it all, i smoke with all my dawgs
i bang and ball, i does it all, i smoke with all my dawgs
my paint wet, my feet chrome
fuck boys hate, but they sing along
the real niggas admire, success makes you inspire

bitches feeding me fruit, no longer watch for...
