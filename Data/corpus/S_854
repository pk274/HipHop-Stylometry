and every hussla on the corner needs cheese

pull your braids out and roll yo fro back
just like dat
i bend it slow, let me tell u wat i'm in it fo
sorta like a mineral, but i'm more than a general
no longer a criminal, me an tookie williams for real
we were identical, he took me to the pinnacle


so i’ma spread tha word now that my og is free as a bird
u heard wat i said; u thought that he was betta off dead
but his teachings and doctrines is wat i'ma spread
i love leading those, who love to be led
and i love feeding those, who wanna be fed
so stand in line and get your tickets
ain't no wine and no bread
it's just lines and new rhymes about the crimes that i did
if u doin it big, u gotta handle yo biz, and in the memory of
we go educate the kids
sangfroid that's the word and the lesson
for those unaware that means i'm calm under pressure

on some dangerous shit
now for real, for real, we go the beverly hills
and do a couple of licks, till i stack me some bricks
and we will not quit, until we see fit

i had a stripper used to tip her her name was chanelle
she used to bring me money when i was locked up in jail
and when i got out, i was goin wit her everywhere
she understood me girl yeah she was wat a player
i didn't have to press it; never eva had to stress it
and every time i think about it, damn it’s a blessin'
and i'm confessin', and i’m addressin'
all the ladies who love to love a real man
do ya damn thang, don't be embarrassed
