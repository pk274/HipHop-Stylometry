this, that, unapologetic, kinetic
big snoop dogg, i said it
let it be known, we grown up off that zapp
big boom, bap, slap
this in your cassette or deck
another ounce to bounce your neck
respect out here on the west
roger troutman – the best
yes yes, and my nephew les
say "snoop, kick something off your chest"
let the bird fly from the nest
battlecat and dogg with connect on the set
breathe, now let it rest
strings and guitars, hood stars
all up in your neighborhood, yes we are
blowing hella smoke out of fresh cigars
a lot of dee-dah-dah, a lot of dee-dah-dah
roger troutman – the best
we grown up off that zapp
