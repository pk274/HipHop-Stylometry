i'm chilling like a villain while i'm dealing, i am
ruling while i'm cooling with my tool in my hand
post up, coast up, this is my life, bitch
up close on ya, you'll get stuck with a knife, bitch
cuz burnt out, turnt out like a light switch
got a lot of hoes, but charlene that's my white bitch
the rest of my bitches, nah they ain't gon' like this
but i don't give a fuck cause they all love this nightstick
but i still remain calm, bang and drop bombs
collar popped up, cool as the fonz
motherfucker! have a seat and loosen up
get a glass of some gin, now juice it up, deuces up
see it's a line there for a reason
and if you cross it, no more breathing, ya leaving
believe it - we understand each other?
cause i would hate to have to put a slug in ya, brother - ya dig?
