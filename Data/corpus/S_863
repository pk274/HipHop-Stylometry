all i wanna be is well known now
drive a 'lac, big mack and do my own style
keep a freak on the street that fit the profile
at the pad, money stack, watchin' dough pile
reminiscin' of a player that i once knew
he had it all, went broke but he still kept it true
bounced back like a real mack, got a new sack
new hoes, new clothes and found a new track
now that's a player that i always wanna be like
did dirt, went to church and lived the street life
ask short, ask snoop, we gon' tell you the truth
a real pimp keep a prostitute, and she get lots of loot
do what she gots to do
come back with moolah like she 'posed to do
and stay close to you
so if you ever fell
here's the one most important thing about this tale
ask michelle, tammy and nell when they went to jail
they know who came through with that bail - it was me
'cause i respect the p, do the same
don't be no lame, respect the game
