get down like get around
i'm the shit, legit, big wig in this town
sit down or get clowned
big leaps and big bounds
big verbs and big nouns
boss moves in my crip walk shoes
i bet on my own niggas and i did not lose
fuckin' niggas up with this rick rock groove
tick, tock, make your body rock, we meet up at the marriott
niggas deep while you niggas sleep
outside pockets full of heat, bitches in the back sleep
niggas don't like it, but niggas peep
i make the rules and break 'em if i want to


dragged up, i done hit the switch, let it work out
old block full of old schools
thick bitches, they gon' chew
the dogg's making bread with my niggas at def jam
and ain't nobody fuckin' with the legion of boom
i don't play around, master plan
