i'm out to paper count the paper, bump some bitches and move
i take a trip with my click on a three day cruise
bank a corner in the fo', sittin' low, gettin' low
now we headed to the sto' in the fo', hoes holler
top dollar with the gold flea collar
dippin in my blue impala
they say snoop dogg is a fool
'cause he got the bitches and the little homie sellin' weed up outta high school
i never ever break the law, i just bend it
keep everything splendid, that's how i intended
class is in session, you might get suspended (shhhh)
if you don't shut the fuck up and listen for a minute
i been in it for life, with two kids and a wife
with no tattoos, just stress and stripes
so, i'mma do what i feel and do what i like
but i won't go to sleep without my heater at night (ride on)


let me holler at y'all for a minute, man
i mean this game is gettin' real deep
we got niggas that be misrepresentin'
i mean, motherfuckers, you know, thinkin the dpg
is a motherfuckin football game or a football team or somethin
niggas walkin on and shit like they free agents
and just leavin when they want to
nigga, this ain't no game, this is a motherfuckin way of life
dpgc, dogg pound gangsta... nigga!
the fuck wrong with these niggas, man?
niggas be straight tryin to put they little twist down (holla at em)
but you know we tryin to stay two steps ahead of the game baby, y'know?
let me holler at y'all for a minute, especially you


you done stepped in some dogg shit, check your shoes
nigga, this ain't hollywood, the house of blues
it's the dogg house, so regroup your troops
and tell em... it's kurupt and snoop
fuck your crew, it's on, i take your brougham
it's don corleone in the chronic zone
i turn your dubs into nickels, while i'm chillin
i melt your rhymes into icicles, while i'm killin
sell em, i tell em, kurupt, west up
i know you feel like, givin it up
we can't stop, won't stop, what foe
cause every other day another nigga tryin to pull a dulo
you know, when i was fuckin with the hood
it was all bad, thought it was all good
a nigga had to take a breather
now i'm living single, like khadijah, 'cause they'll squeeze ya
fuck a feeding fish
i put my dick in your bitch and make a wish, ha ha
nigga, that's gangsta shit, with the gangsta twist
yeah, dogg pound gangsta...
