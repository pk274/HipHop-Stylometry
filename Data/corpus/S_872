every time i twist one up, you always seem to come right on by (come right on by, yeah)
you ain't never got no money, but you always wanna get a free high (get a free high, yeah)
so don't be fuckin' (don't be fuckin', who took the roaches out my ashtray?), with my roaches in my ashtray
don't be touchin' (don't be touchin', you took the roaches out my ashtray?), not my roaches in my ashtray
i be lovin' (i be lovin', who took the roaches out my ashtray?), all my roaches in my ashtray
so don't be fuckin' (don't be fuckin', you took the roaches out my ashtray?), with my roaches in my ashtray


nigga slid up in my car in the passenger seat
talking my ears off, adjusting my beat
stashed my heat up under my sеat
stepped out my ride, hollеred at a few freaks
take a couple flicks, mack a bitch
baby, what's your name? (passionate)
fashion nova, fashion fit
dogg, where the weed at? ain't that a bitch
i'm gibbing right now, it's thanksgiving right now
showing baby how i'm livin' right now
clear the crowd, back to my car, no squares in my circle
bodyguard hard, could've swore i left a blunt in my ashtray
little homie slid up on me, pulled a fast play, but this the last play
don't be fuckin' with my roaches in my ashtray
hate to see ya comin', love it when you walk away


every time i twist one up, you always seem to come right on by (come right on by, yeah)
you ain't never got no money, but you always wanna get a free high (get a free high, yeah)
so don't be fuckin' (don't be fuckin', who took the roaches out my ashtray?), with my roaches in my ashtray
don't be touchin' (don't be touchin', you took the roaches out my ashtray?), not my roaches in my ashtray
i be lovin' (i be lovin', who took the roaches out my ashtray?), all my roaches in my ashtray
so don't be fuckin' (don't be fuckin', you took the roaches out my ashtray?), with my roaches in my ashtray


seat on recliner, suede headliner
just pulled in mel's diner, line of
chevys, 'lacs, name it, it's there
fresh wet paint, leather interior
players are everywhere
nothing but love and good bud in the air (yeah)
guap took his camera out
taking pictures of the homies in they cars
while they hittin' switches, some knocking bitches
me, i'm on a mission
fuel injected, front end suspension
wishing the whole world roll like we ride
there's always one homie tryna get that free high
shit never fails, yeah, this shit for sale
skip the bail, put the shit on a scale
this the last day for your last play
quit fucking with the roaches in my ashtray


every time i twist one up, you always seem to come right on by (come right on by, yeah)
you ain't never got no money, but you always wanna get a free high (get a free high, yeah)
so don't be fuckin' (don't be fuckin', who took the roaches out my ashtray?), with my roaches in my ashtray
don't be touchin' (don't be touchin', you took the roaches out my ashtray?), not my roaches in my ashtray
i be lovin' (i be lovin', who took the roaches out my ashtray?), all my roaches in my ashtray
so don't be fuckin' (don't be fuckin', you took the roaches out my ashtray?), with my roaches in my ashtray


say, man, you niggas think y'all crafty, huh?
sitting in my car, adjusting my music
telling me how sweet my car is and all of the sudden my roaches is missin'
say, man, don't be fuckin' with the roaches in my ashtray
you hear me?
