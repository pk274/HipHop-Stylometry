a lot of y'all got snoopy dogg on y'all bucket list
you wanna smoke a bleeze? you wanna bust a flig?
i've got no problem with it - my nigs, just make it quick
i'm tryna lay low, hey ho, as i stay low in your bitch
she couldn't roll a blunt 'til i taught the ho and now she's a pro
easy though to freeze a ho, pleasable and feasible
scary thing, that mary jane
gon' do her thing no matter what
get gat 'em up, tizatted up - it's bad enough, next batter up
dreaded up, breaded up - connect the dots, set it up
we blow 'til you can't get enough
like "give that up," don't give a fuck
rules i bend 'em, hoes i break 'em
take they mind and in time reshape 'em
once i got 'em, shoot 'em, shot 'em
now the bitch is my new assistant
lookin' good, steady twistin'
exercise to maximize
minimize my bottom, problem
let me tell you what i'm gon' do
diamond lane, comin' through
sell a pound, maybe two
in the red, in the blue
smokin' green like "what it do?"
