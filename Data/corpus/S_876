rollin' down the highway
pedal to the floor
same fools ridin' that been down for years (ooh, ooh)
nigga pullin' real weight
same fools ridin' that been down for years
so i won't be broke no more
same fools ridin' that been down for years
rollin' down the highway
same fools ridin' that been down for years
pedal to the floor (pedal to the medal, you know)
same fools ridin' that been down for years (ooh, ooh)
nigga pullin' real weight (real weight)
same fools ridin' that been down for years
'cause i can't be broke no more


i'm on the 17 in a benz, tryna get some more wins
i dip out, i dip in, i jump out, i jump in
i roll out, i roll in, no talkin', just dump in
never punk out, motherfucker, we punked in (nigga)
i get the money up front
then drive off very casually, blazin' a blunt
i'm slidin' off, listenin' to 213 and, ah, man
life is so hard when you're doggy the doggy dogg
i'm talkin' to myself at times, tryna walk a straight line
driftin', drinkin' and drivin', smokin' on mine
tryna keep myself from gettin' caught up
'cause i ain't got time to be doin' time
you might've seen me in the 69, monte carlo
honey blonde, two of a kind, a little toy of mine
g-funk back in action, cadillac maccin' (snoop dogg)
and you can catch me with theâ€”
