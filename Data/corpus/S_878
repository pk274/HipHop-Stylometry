all up in a nigga face with the same game
let me tell you what i'm gon' do
i hop on my sike life, night life
nigga make a dream come true for you
now turn the beat down g style
everybody know my heat go boom
splash and mash and pictures flashing
man my life so cool
let me get back to the camp
i'm rapping now, cookies in the bag
and the vast amounts mixed in with peaches n cream
creep on the scene
crip nigga with the thief and the scene
the war deep with the team
late night creep on 'em, i mean
hit 'em with lot botta bing
all about the money in the green
top down, drop down on 'em clean
