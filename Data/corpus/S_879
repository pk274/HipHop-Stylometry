first thing first, chucks on right
flag on left, banging my set
2 chicks with me on bc
don't snort coke or drink no lean
strap in the purse, they burst first to blast
can't hit a party with a hefty bag
we are, in a league of our own
if you ain't 'bout that, leave it alone
cause if it don't turn you on, it'll turn you wrong
like get the thumper or get the thumpin' alone
dressed like a sharpshooter, knowing something is wrong
but i don't give a fuck, 20 crip to the dome
