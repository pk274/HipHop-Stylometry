original, a lot of style, boom-pow
blowin' on the pound, puh-puh-puh-puh-pow
way up in the cloud
misbehave the flav', now let me show you how
to maintain and sustain as i crush game
smooth as silk with a little bit of kush, mane
plush game, lavish livin'
bust on the pigs with bad intentions
smoke dope, go for broke, young loc
the homie said 9-1-1 is a joke (fuck tha police!)
and i believe that so i protect and serve
every nigga on the block, that's my word
cadillac drivin', stackin', providin'
listen to the sounds of the sirens
i'm a o.g. nigga on a mission
beans don't burn in the kitchen
i'm twistin' while dippin' and crippin'
