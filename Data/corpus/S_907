the cloud becomes black and the sky becomes blue
now you in the midst of the dogg pound crew
ain't no clue on why the fuck we do what we do
leave you in a state of paranoia, ooh
don't make a move for your gat so soon
'cause i drops bombs like platoon (ayy, nigga)
walk with me, hold my hand and let me lead you
i'll take you on a journey, and i promise i won't leave you (i won't leave you)
until you get the full comprehension
and when you do, that's when the mission
or survival becomes your every thought
keep your eyes open, 'cause you don't wanna be caught
half-stepping with your weapon on safety
now break yourself, motherfucker, 'fore you make me
take this two-eleven to another level
i come up with your ends, you go down with the devil
now roam through the depths of hell
where the rest your busta-ass homeboys dwell, well


suicide, it's a suicide
suicide, it's a suicide
suicide, it's a suicide
now tell me, what's my motherfuckin' name?
serial killa
serial killa
serial killa
wake up in the morning, eat your lucky charms cereal
