share, share, share alike
i'll share my skateboard i'll share my bike
if you share your snacks i'll share my treats
so when we get hungry we all can eat
you're favorite story from a book
you can share with friends
and if they love that story
they'll share it again
sharing never stops
it's the gift that gives
so let’s all share
because we care, there it is!


sharing isn’t just about toys and food
you can share your emotions and share your mood
if you're feeling blue and start tearing up
just share how you feel and we'll cheer you up
caring is a major part of this here thing
you can even share your crayons, yellow or green
share your cotton candy or goldfish
know that sharing is caring--but you already know this!
