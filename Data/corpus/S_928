drop the bomb, ring the alarm
we are here to do bodily harm
now grab your girl and run along
'cause she'll be with me by the end of the song
ayo, kaan, what it do?
you take her and i'll take two
stop depressing, stop the crying
red alert, hit the sirens
all ladies are in for free
dimes, dubs, they all from me
all you ladies are in for free
here's my number, call for me
get nasty, get freaky
get wet, now get loose
get nasty, get freaky
get loose, get it girl
