i be eastside rollin', eastside ridin'
big snoop dogg from the eastside slidin'
gangbangin', makin' these hits, i been doin' it
gangbangin', slidin' with sticks, i been doin' it
flag to the left, move right and do my walk like this
the city love me when i talk like this
wait a minute, take a second, let me talk my shit
it's been twenty-plus years and i'm still makin' hits
all the bloods and crips love me, yeah, i'm highly connected
big snoop d-o-g-g, i'm highly respected
i might look like a star, but i'm extra with the business
i ain't even gotta say it, i'm a legend while i'm livin'
i don't know about you, but i'm a product of the crips (cuh-rip)
eastside, big rollin', nigga, r.i.p. to nip (westside)
