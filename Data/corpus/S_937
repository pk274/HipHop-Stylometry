you got the look of a diva, dogg out of all now
follow the procedure, i need you to leave your mind
well, bring your body, ain't nothin' but an eastside party
you know it's crackin' like that, why you actin' like that?
hand me a glass, let me pour you some yak
nice landing and if you act right
by the end of the night, you get the candy
