shit, nigga straight trippin' man
boy trizzoy ran out of bud
i tell joe goin' back to the islands
nigga need a hit man
i ain't had a hit in about a week
i be trying to put this album together without no weed
i don't think i can pull this shit off

i mean damn
i mean when most people think about smoking bud
it's just a passtime hobby
but i mean for me its like
wake up in the morning
i gotta have it
i gots to groove with it, you know
its just a whole thing where i'm missing it right now
i miss this thing like i used to miss my girl
and i mean one question was asked to me
i'm gonna have to ask you the question
do you smoke enough bud
do you get enough bud
cause if you don't you need to
and thats real
