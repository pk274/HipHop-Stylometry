ya see way back in the days when 
another day, another dollar for the s, i guess i'm blessed
since i'm young and black wit' success it's stress
to a nigga mind sometime, but then again
i think of all the homies stretched in the pen
doin' time just to get on swole
i ain't forgot about you niggas, shit i'm still on parole
but uh, in the meantime i watch yo' back
send you some snaps and give ya woman a dope sack
and when ya finally get out the do'
put yo' mind on yo' money and know whatchu out fo'
check yo' game and put yo' law down
ya see, real niggas stay up while punk niggas fall down
it's only right for me to tell you dis
buy game when it's sold, but i ain't tryna sell you dis
a lil' somethin' from the muthafuckin' dogg
i'm bought up and caught up, back to the chronic smog
