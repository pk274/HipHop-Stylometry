uh, to the tick-tock, ya don't stop
uh, to the beep-beep, and you don't freak
uh, check it out, baby bubba in the place to be
my name is snoop (say what?) the one they wanna see
so uh..., blaze up the bud and break out the champagne
'cause we rollin' in the fast lane, tryin' to find the right lane
doin' it just like playas, layin' down laws
governors, mayors pay us to stay up on top of thangs
there's somethin' ‘bout bein' in dat dogg pound gang
that makes me wanna have some type of hustle in life
if bein' wrong is broke, i can’t be right
despite all the madness you hear nowadays
stealin’ rhymes from super duper scenes to get you paid
but you played yaself, 'cause you can’t play me
i see through you, but you can’t see me
