how many real niggas is locked away
behind some bitch-ass nigga with a whole lot to say
man fools is confused ain't no rules to this game
niggas be telling the feds where a nigga lay his head
giving them niggas code names
cold game, but i can't even say shit about it
cause if i catch you slipping, dipping tripping i'm getting rowdy
kill a snitch fuck a bitch i throw 'em both in a ditch
cause they can't stand to see a young nigga getting rich
i'm destined for fame
oh bitch-ass niggas putting salt in the game
put a stain on your brain cause i shall remain
and i know longer dwells in the cocaine game
it's a shame the way the game has switched
and the police man trying to take my shit
i caught a nigga one day jumping out of a cop car
i ain't saying no names but this nigga's a rap star
walking real fast then he dashed in my backyard
buff ass nigga perpetrating to act hard
in the front seat with no cuffs on
i ask him bout the discussion he say the wrong thing i rush him
dust him, cause i can't trust him
plus he working with the boys we bring the noise so fuck 'em
i tuck him in the trunk, i ain't fuckin' with no punk
nigga snitching nigga missing cause we twisting
and that's for all my real niggas locked up
and you bitches that be snitching when a homie sock you up
bitch fix your mouth and get your head right
oh get your muthafuckin' ass out my muthafuckin' house tonight
just like a bitch quick to call the police
but ain't no telling on me and then belling on me
look here, me and p we getting riches
and oh yeah don't forget to tell them bitches
