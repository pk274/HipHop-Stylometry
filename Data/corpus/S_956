look up in the sky, it's a bird, it's a plane
no that's... snooperman


i said some pimp juice
i lay low to get loose
word on the streets is doggy dogg got the goose
on the moon
cause he got a lot to prove
he ain't never taste defeat but this one he gon' lose
on the deuce
i once wanted the truce
but fuck that, this nigga think he bulletproof
i can't talk him, so i brought chalk to him
i had to lay him on the asphalt, bitch nigga ask how
dpgc, l-o-n-g-b-e-a...c-h
is the only way that we play
i catch a nigga by the collar
ay we need to holler
i let you slide when you fuck me out that million dollars
bought me a bitch, a house and a impala
and that they call me top dollar


i do like i do it, can't nobody do it like i can
i'm snooperman
look up in the sky, real high like a bird so i'm fly
i'm snooperman
i do like i do it, can't nobody do it like i can
i'm snooperman


it was december 18th seven days before christmas
i was at the pad putting together my wish list
back then i mean my game was so vicious
i had to shoot a nigga, just cause he was on bitch shit
i mean it seemed so senseless
but i'm a superhero so my life is relentless
biting rhymes nah, i be biting grinds
and fucking niggas up accross of the line
flying through the sky like a bird off that purple light
you niggas can't wait for me to turn it out
i flip a style, crip a while, gon' honey child
ran up about a hundred miles
threw about a hundred styles
you can check my file i'm the one and only
i make records for the girls and the lil homies


i do like i do it, can't nobody do it like i can
i'm snooperman
look up in the sky, real high like a bird so i'm fly
i'm snooperman
i do like i do it, can't nobody do it like i can
i'm snooperman


wow snooperman is totally awesome
i used to wanna be batman, the incredible hulk

i wanna be snooperman
he is the greatest superhero of all time
i love you snooperman, you're the greatest
woah snooperman my hero


i do like i do it, can't nobody do it like i can
i'm snooperman
look up in the sky, real high like a bird so i'm fly
i'm snooperman
i do like i do it, can't nobody do it like i can
i'm snooperman
