woo, yeah
welcome to tha chuuch, volume 2
exclusive 213 (ah, ha, ha)
got my nephew nate dogg in the house
nate dogg, holla at 'em, where you at?


ridin' in my car
and i'm listenin' to the radio
i'm listenin' to a sad girl sing
sing about how she got her heart broke
people reachin' for stars
i just want me somethin' natural
when you're alone, it gets mighty cold
don't act as if you did not know
she let me play with her heart
i'm workin' late, i said, "i'll soon be home"
all the while the girl was home alone
let me tell what she cryin' for (why?)
'cause i'm fly (yeah, he super fly, nate dogg)
woah, oh-oh, i'm fly, yeah


yeah, you know he super fly
but me, i'm snooper dooper and i'm super duper fly (fly, fly)
i be the greatest 'cause i know you waited this
and i wanted this to be elaborate and so strenuos
then you just slide by and wiz-ave
you on another piz-age
that the way that you gon' be-hiz-ave?
i know you feelin' all hurt inside
but you won't talk to a player, let me help out your pride?
i'm like a counselor, a pastor, a priest or a psychologist
a shrink on a freak, peep my technique
i wear minks, gator boots and i'm the one that gets the loot
and i ain't afraid to shoot, and i love to toot-toot
beep-beep as i slide up the street
i'm from the lbc and i don't know what y'all done heard about me
but i'm a c-r-i-p with some p-i-m-p too
i'm a real pimp player from the 213 crew
now look here, boo, if you gon' bang or hang with the dogg
you best to get in, holla at her, nate dogg (holla, holla, holla)
