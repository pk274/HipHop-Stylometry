that's how life is now homie


i'm just sittin' back vibin' to some al green now
10, 11, 12 years in the game and i came from the seenile
got a gang of loved ones in the penile
fighting for they lives everyday
but meanwhile
i see my life is sort of like theirs 'cause other than mom's and boo-boo nobody else cares
i know you think i'm tweekin'
but the only time i gеt to see my kids is on the visitin' weekend
i ain't in no chains
but sometimеs i get tested by the places i hang
and my gang just banged on these niggas from the other side now i got repercussions, suckas is bustin'
talk is cheap
and for some apparent reason
the streets keep watchin' me, well watch me
and watch ya back
pop pop i got ya that ratta-tat nigga
i stay strapped
