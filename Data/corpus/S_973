yo, this shit feel like sports center
nothing but highlights, some ballers
jumping out the mother fucking gym
so designer flow
it's your uncle snoop dogg
let me show you how we keep the trap jumpin' on the west side
the best side


mcdonald's all american
there's really no comparing it
i play some d and pop a three and fly up in the air again
first-round draft pick came in with this rap shit
get a lot of moolah to keep you a bad bitch
those were the rules, i aimed for the full pie
took a slice and now i'm popping at the bull's eye
i'm equivalent to excellence
with my weaponry, i'm stepping while i'm rapping it
now could i should i would i do things your way
and end up dead or in jail? my nigga no way
it's like some good hot head with no foreplay
i won't be caught so i cut you like i'm oj
kingpin nietzche
designer flow hand me the ball young dawg i need a heat check
reset, he wet
dikembe mutombo, that we shit
