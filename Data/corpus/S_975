ashanti, you ever been in love before?


you want it? i got it! it’s dripping like water
what, you want a baby? a boy, or a daughter?
what he gon’ say? what ya mama think?
it’s up to you, let’s make this smooth, getaway
i got this spot, hideaway, i’m in this here to wait
i’ll be yo backbone, i’m so grown, baby girl, i’m here to stay
while you shaking fools, yeah, i’m breaking fools
love it when you love me, then you cook me that jamaican food

i outta quit, but i think not
another bottle pop, now we floating on a yacht
i’m at the top of your life, put your choosing shoes on
and let the dogg be the rock in your life
it’s so immaculate, i never thought, that i’d see the day
where i’d be loving you down, let me lead the way
if we gon’ be together, ain’t no breaking up
just laughing, kissing, and hugging, now we making love
