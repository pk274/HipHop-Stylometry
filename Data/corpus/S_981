yeah, nigga, we're still fuckin' with you
still waters run deep
still snoop dogg and d.r.e
'99, nigga, guess who's back
still, still doin' that shit, andre?
oh for sho'
yeah
check me out


it's still dre day nigga, ak nigga
though i've grown a lot, can't keep it home a lot
‘cause when i frequent the spots that i'm known to rock
you hear the bass from the truck when i'm on the block
ladies they pay homage, but haters say dre fell off
how? nigga, my last album was the chronic
they wanna know if he still got it
they say rap's changed, they wanna know how i feel about it
(if you ain't up on thangs)
dr. dre is the name, i'm ahead of my game
still puffin' my leaves, still fuck with the beats
still not lovin' police (uh-uh)
still rock my khakis with a cuff and a crease (for sho')
still got love for the streets, reppin' 213 (for life)
still the beats bang, still doin' my thang
since i left ain't too much changed, still


i'm representin' for them gangstas all across the world
(still) hittin' them corners in them low-lows, girl
still takin' my time to perfect the beat
and i still got love for the streets, it's the d.r.e
i'm representin' for them gangstas all across the world
(still) hittin' them corners in them low-lows, girl
still takin' my time to perfect the beat
and i still got love for the streets, it's the d.r.e

it ain't nothin' but more hot shit
another classic cd for y'all to vibe with
whether you're coolin' on the corner with your fly bitch
laid back in the shack, play this track
i'm representin' for the gangstas all across the world
still (hittin' them corners in them low-lows, girl)
i'll break your neck, damn near put your face in your lap
niggas try to be the king, but the ace is back
(so if you ain't up on thangs)
dr. dre be the name, still runnin' the game
still got it wrapped like a mummy
still ain't trippin', love to see young blacks get money
spend time out the hood, take they moms out the hood
hit my boys off with jobs, no more livin' hard
barbeques every day, drivin' fancy cars
still gon' get mine regardless (still)

right back up in your mothafuckin' ass
9-5 plus four pennies! add that shit up
d.r.e. right back up on top of thangs
smoke some with your dogg
no stress, no seeds, no stems, no sticks!
some of that real sticky icky icky
ooh wee! put it in the air!
boy, you's a fool, d-r
