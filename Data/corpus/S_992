ayo, steppin' through the fog and creepin' through the smog
it's the number one nigga from the hood, doggy dogg
making videos, now i stay in hollywood
bustin' raps for my snaps, now they call me eastwood
dre is the doctor and my homie, lil' nigga
warren g is my hand and my hand's on the trigger
shootin' at the hoes with the game that i got
sent to death row 'cause i wanted to make a grip from servin' my rocks
and i'm still servin' for mine
peace to my motherfuckin' homies doin' time
in the pen and the county jail
mobbin' with your blues on, mad as hell
and you're sayin', "fuck the police"
and all the homies on the streets is all about peace
and it's drivin' the cops crazy
but ain't nothin' but a black thing, baby
uh, i'm not flaggin', but i'm just saggin'
i bet you don't wanna see the d-o-double-g
and you can't see the d-r to the e
or my motherfuckin' homie d.o.c
you know you can't fuck with my motherfuckin' dj
that's my homie and we call him warren g
yeah, and you don't stop
doggy dogg break 'em down with the motherfuckin' dogg pound
that's the only way we'll beat 'em, man
we gotta smoke 'em then choke 'em like the motherfuckin' peterman
it's like three and to the two and two and to the one
cell block four, peace, doggy dogg's done
