since i was young i grew up in the street life
times get hard for a gangsta in the street life
ain't no tellin' what my life might be like
growin' up in the street life
since i was young i grew up in the street life
times get hard for a gangsta in the street life
ain't no tellin' what my life might be like
growin' up in the street life


you can't tell me shit, about these streets homie
i done lived it and done it, runnin' from the police
out for the money, homies maintain their composure
now that we older we sellin' ki's by the doja
now i'm a soldier motherfucker for the chips wanna dip to trip
headed straight for d.c., down for d.p
flipped the script and came equipped
with some riders who got my back
snoop corleone, you know i'm always down to jack
i jack for instant thought, talkin' walk the walk
niggas who oppose automatically get stomped
terrorizing the neighborhood niggas gainin' they grab me
southside and dash, mashin' for the rep
test in peace to deceased homeboys who ain't alive
street life took him over now he forced to die
slippin' and slidin', bouncin' countin' my ends
to be straight, times is ruff for these days
niggas is crazy, but the fear is much greater
the innovater, dominator, soul creator, out for the papers!
