wheelin' and dealin', appealin', i'm realin'
ya still in love with me, al green
i'm at it, romantic, no panic, organic

you're laying on your bed, just playing with yourself
you're moaning and groaning, you're squirming and squealing
guess it's true, i left you


stuck on a feeling

better lock this down, better box it up (yeah-eh)
gotta work me out, make it real (work it out, yeah)
gotta make it count, get stuck on a feeling
