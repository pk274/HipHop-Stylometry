it's summer in da hood, it's a place to go
a place to cool off, kick back, and just flow
it's a place for me to unwind and let go
gotta love it, summer in da hood


every day feel like a sunday in lbc
cool breeze went through and hit me with that real g
rollin' in my benz with all the homies blazin'
asking the lord above, please don't change what's happening
my crew steady thriftin' like we lookin' for a come up
ain't gonna back down, gonna drop some fire to make it jump
a seal of protection with my homeboys, i'ma keep it comin'
causе this the 'hood, all day, it's summer in da hood nigga

 it's summer in da hood, it's a placе to go
a place to cool off, kick back, and just flow
it's a place for me to unwind and let go
gotta love it, summer in da hood
