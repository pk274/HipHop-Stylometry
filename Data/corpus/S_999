top selector number one big snoop d-o-double-g, ya!
come again, bo, bo!
something bout this night
something bout this light, yahhhhh


illa dilla, i'ma killer
snoopy dogg with the gorillaz
layin low, on the floor
my hands up high, i'm full of dro
girlies tryin to kiss me slow
i'm leaning like a sixty-four
this life i live's incredible
these trees i breeze are medical
take a look, in my eyes
hold on tight, enjoy the ride
if you don't feel good then you out of place
my universe, is outer space
my look, my style, my prada case
lil' daddy get out our face
trip this, sip this, hit that, now sit on back
and let dogg go and get on that
party people you invited


what a night to get involved
everybody have a ball
celebrate and fill your cup
drink until you get enough
how you feel, i got that feeling
disco lights hang from the ceiling
ain't nobody on the wall
pop it, drop it, let that fall
hey dj, play my song
step back, let it bang all night long
i need your attention, no hoping or wishing
come in, in high-definition
said i do, right that i do
get up and get money, yep that i do
rode it, ride it, lick it
bite it, roll it, light it
party people you invited


party people you invited
something like this light, something like this
something like this night, something like this
something like this light, something like this night
something like this light, something like this night
