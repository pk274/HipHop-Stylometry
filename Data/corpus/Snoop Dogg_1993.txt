for all my dogs keepin' y'all in health
just to see you smile and enjoy yourself
'cause it's cool when you cause the cozy condition
in which we create  'cause that's our mission
so listen close to what we say
because this types of shit happens every day
i woke up around ten o'clock in the morning
i gave myself a stretch up, a morning yawn, and
went to the bathroom to wash up
i threw some soap on my face and put my hands upon a cup
and said, "um, mirror mirror, on, the wall
who is the top dog of them all?"
there was a ruffle duffle, five minutes it lasted
the mirror said, "you are, you conceited bastard"
well, that's true, that's why we never have no beef
so i slipped off my khakis and my gold leaf
used oil of olay 'cause my skin gets pale
and then i got the file for my fingernails
i'm true to the style on my behalf
i put the bubbles in the tub so i can take a bubble bath
clean, dry, was my body and hair
i threw on my brand new doggy underwear
for all the bitches i might take home
i got the johnson's baby powder and cool water cologne
now i'm fresh, dressed like a million bucks
threw on my white socks with my all-blue chucks
stepped out the house, stopped short, "oh no"
i went back in, "i forgot my indo"
then i dilly (dally) i ran through a (alley)
i bumped into this smoker named (sally) from the (valley)
this was a girl playing hard to get
so i said, "what's wrong?" 'cause she looked upset
she said, um


damn, now what was i to do?
she's crying over me and she was feelin' blue
i said, "um, don't cry, dry your eye
and here comes your mother with those two little guys"
her mean mother step, then says to me, "hi"
decked sally in the face and punched her in the eye
punched her in the belly and stepped on her feet
slammed the child on the hard concrete
the bitch was strong, the kids was gone
somethin' was wrong, i said, "what was goin' on?"
i tried to break it up, i said, "stop it, just leave her"
she said, "if i can't smoke none, she can't either"
she grabbed me closely by my socks
and so i broke the hell out and i grabbed my sack of rocks
but um, they gave chase, they caught up quick
they started cryin' on my shoes and grabbin' my dick
and sayin', "why don't you give me a play
so we can break it down the long beach way
and if you give me that okay
i'll give you all my love today
doggy, doggy, doggy, can't you see?
somehow your words just hypnotize me
and i just love your jazzy ways
doggy dogg, your love is here to stay"
and on and on and on, she kept goin'
the bitch been around before my mother's born
i said, "cheer up," so i gave her a hit
i said, "you can't have me, i'm too young for you, bitch"
she said, "no, you're not," then she starts cryin'
i says, "i'm nineteen," she says, "stop lyin'"
i says, "i am, go ask my mother
and with your wrinkled pussy, i can't be your lover"


yeah, uh, tick-tock, you don't stop
and to the, uh, tick-tock and you don't quit
yeah, tick-tock and you don't stop
and to the, uh, tick-tock and you don't quit

as i look up at the sky
my mind starts tripping, a tear drops my eye
my body temperature falls
i'm shaking and they break in tryna save the dogg
pumping on my chest and i'm screaming
i stop breathing, damn, i see demons
dear god, i wonder, can you save me?
i can't die, my boo boo's 'bout to have my baby
i think it's too late for praying, hold up
a voice spoke to me and it slowly started saying
bring your lifestyle to me, i'll make it better
how long will i live? eternal life and forever
and will i be the g that i was?
i'll make your life better than you can imagine or even dreamed of
so relax your soul, let me take control
close your eyes, my son, my eyes are closed


murder
murder was the case that they gave me
murder
murder was the case that they gave me

i'm fresh up out my coma
i got my mama and my daddy and my homies in my corner
it's gonna take a miracle they say
for me to walk again and talk again, but anyway
i get fronted some ki's to get back on my feet
and everything that nigga said came to reality
living like a baller loc
having money and blowing hella chronic smoke
i bought my mama a benz and bought my boo boo a jag
and now i'm rolling in a nine-trizzay el do-rad
just remember who changed your mind
'cause when you start set-tripping, that ass is mine
indeed, agreed, proceed to smoke weed
never have a want, never have a need
they say i'm greedy but i still want more
'cause my eyes wanna journey some more, really though (check it out)


now i lay me down to sleep
i pray the lord, my soul to keep
if i should die before i wake
i pray the lord, my soul to take


no more indo, gin and juice
i'm on my way to chino, rolling on the grey goose
shackled from head to toe
twenty-five with an izzel, with nowhere to gizzo, i know
them niggas from the other side recognize my face
'cause it's the o.g. d-o-double-g, l-b-c
mad dogging niggas 'cause i don't care
red jumpsuit with two braids in my hair
niggas stare as i enter the center
they send me to a level three yard, that's where i stay
late night i hear toothbrushes scraping on the floor
niggas getting they shanks, just in case the war
pops off, 'cause you can't tell what's next
my little homie baby boo took a pencil in his neck
and he probably won't make it to see twenty-two
i put that on my mama, i'ma ride for you, baby boo

'cause i drops bombs like platoon (ayy, nigga)
walk with me, hold my hand and let me lead you
i'll take you on a journey, and i promise i won't leave you (i won't leave you)
until you get the full comprehension
and when you do, that's when the mission
or survival becomes your every thought
keep your eyes open, 'cause you don't wanna be caught
half-stepping with your weapon on safety
now break yourself, motherfucker, 'fore you make me
take this 211 to another level
i come up with your ends, you go down with the devil

where the rest your busta-ass homeboys dwell, well
