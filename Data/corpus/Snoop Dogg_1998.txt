bustin shots hoping to hit someone
so i just stopped and let off three shot
two hit that nigga and one hit a cop
i threw down the gun and began to shout
"ay y'all all lets break out got 'em dip out

had his homeboys plugged, wearing gold chains
hanging at the studio, splurging and thangs
nigga f**king off money, saving them hoes
f**ked off some money of mine
and bought me a white rolls
living on wilshire in a penthouse suite
f**king bad bitches seven days a week
colder than a motherf**ker but now i'm hot

but it's a cold game
i ain't make the rules to this game
look, all i know and all i do
is try to come through with something new
banging for you
so whatever you do, you like it or not
because when your shit play out

my grandpappy once sat me in his lap and he said
"son get your money like that" (get your money, man)
i sit alone in the zone
face of stone

eastside up, eastsiders cause we riding (eastside up)
this is portable something to f**k with your ear
doggy dogg will appear to make it sound so clear
i f**ks it up, like i always do
and that's a trick
i'm saying some shit
to make the bitches want to suck my dick

playin' it close with a bunch of thug niggas, drug dealers
project fools, c-murder pass them tools
