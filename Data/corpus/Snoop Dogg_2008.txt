yeah, this record is for my baby, my baby boo
i know i'm always on the road, i'm always gone
and you say i don't ever make records for you no mo'
well this record is from me to you baby
yeah, real talk


i seen everything twice
been around the world i seen every scene twice
stompin' down in tokyo, dippin' in the rice
i'm a boss at the wind, i cracked every color dice
i do it big, fuck the rumors
rich and infamous with the blue and gray pumas
gangstas don't die they just move to miami
i did all that, i was voted my candy
i'm somethin' like sammy
smoother than marvin, i need me a tammi
sippin' chardonnay, makin' bills on my hands-free
father hood, now the actors can't stand me
cause i own rap and i'm comin' for your day job
until then, i'm chillin' at the day spa
relax my mind and just chill
cause without you, none of this is real
baby you know i


yeah, but now i'm back across the water
i'm in sydney with somebody's daughter
blowin' sticky by the zips
and they can tell by how my rag hang, nigga this crip
but i'm chillin'; it feels so good to get away
especially when your name is d-o-double-gizzee
coast to coast jettin', man i been doin that
what y'all just start ballin' cuz? i been up out the trap
poppin' p's with the bosses
300 for the yacht, the third deck got an office
dockin' down in monaco, churchin' with my folks
bad lucc had me dyin' when he fell up out that boat
my life is like a movie
but the bad guy don't die at the end, so sue me
then i relax and chill
cause without you, none of this is real
baby you know i


see you baby
yeah i'm on my way home right now
i'm on my way right now!
i'm leavin' the studio right now
(none of them, none of them, yeahhhhhh)
yeah, soon as i get home i'ma, i'ma go unplug it
matter fact i ain't even gon' bring it in the house
see you in a minute

i guess it's true, you can't take the hood out the homeboy
plus my hood just lost another homeboy
another one got locked, and we don't know
if he comin' home boy
the industry tell me, just leave it alone boy
let them do them, take care of your own boy
but i sit back, think about, before i was grown boy
then had dreams of bein' a doe boy
yeah i was runnin' from the po-po, bangin' for the turf
late night huntin', puttin' in work
hood day comin', airbrushed shirt
payday at the spot, got my haircut first
made mom sick when i wouldn't go to church
see i live in the 'burbs but i think 21st
i know since i've left that it's gotten much worse
but i'd still be there if i couldn't write a verse




to the blocks that raised me
the enemies and the homies that made me
tough enough to hang on the corners that would mold me
critics wonder if i'm tryin' to be the old me
but if they think the old me ever left
then they don't really know me
and gon' know we don't change, we just become o.g
you always addicted to the life, you just don't o.d
but shit, i owe the streets before they owe me
took me in when my mama didn't want me
too wild to be her child, and pops not around
now all i got now is the homies
to teach me, how to be a man and what not
how to break ounces into grams and what not
the reason i'm so nice with my hands and what not
shit, you think i forgot? nah




thank god every day that the boy could spit
and all around the world they enjoyin' my shit
i know i got plenty more awards to get
i got a beautiful wife and some gorgeous kids
but it wouldn't be right if i ignored the shit
that made me who i am, the music and the man
told me that i can before the world gave a damn
if it wasn't for my niggas sayin' stick to the plan
probably be a gun instead of a pen in my hand
probably be doin' a dub in the pen with my man
they say leave the streets but they don't really understand
all i had was the block when i didn't have fans
rapped on the corners when i couldn't get spins
all i had was the homies when i didn't have kids
if it all came down, my career was to end
i'm sure my name would live, in these streets



oh, boy, it's your uncle big snoopy d-o double g, oohweeee
and i'm ego trippin', ahahaaaaaaaa
i got my boy mistah fabby davis
i got my boy too $hort

1992, "deep cover" hit the world and fell in love with snoop
"doggystyle" came out, it's like i dropped a bomb
one of the greatest hip-hop records of all time
i was young gettin' money, livin' wild and free
got on and i brought the whole pound with me
didn't matter who's around, i kept it way too g
niggas knew it was eastside l.b.c
gangsta shit, that's what a motherfuckin' gangsta get
the one up above didn't like my pace
i was movin' too fast and i caught that case
i fought that case, wonder where the west would be if i'da lost that case
i slow mine down, swimmin' with the sharks and i almost drowned


i'm finally out
and the critics hated on me cause i went to the south
said i wasn't gon' shine, had me left for dead
switched sides, now my old boss want me dead
dropped the first of the three and you said it was weak
"no limit top dogg", the return of the beast
so from that point on i know what to do
don't worry 'bout them just do what you do
"last meal" was the one that took me off the leash
that's the last time a nigga gon' eat off of me
stack plaque after plaque, gain millions sold
i'm the bo$$ of this bitch and i ain't never went gold, nigga


bo$$ of the city, boss of the coast
some other niggas tried but none of 'em come close
they stuck lookin' silly, but nothin' like a loc
the bigg bow wow, i kill it with one stroke
(wow!) that's what it's about
they tryin' to tell a nigga what could come out his mouth
motherfucker i'm a g, but first i'm a man
freedom of speech, bitch is a word you can't ban
so they blamin' me, sayin' this my talk
to some women as hoes, like it's my fault
damn they lost, man they just don't know
that a bitch is a bitch, and a ho is a ho
let them heaters cock and let them leaders talk
i'm gon' be smokin' dank, livin' like a boss
let them heaters cock and let them leaders talk
i'mma be smokin' my dank, livin' like a boss, nigga
