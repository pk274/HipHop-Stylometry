we're having a good day
let's make it a great night
you know i see you
and tell you you're so tight
my special lady
you're one of a kind
and every time i see you shine
it's like the lights of midnight
on new year's eve
and i do believe
on new year's eve
we can make it
we can live forever

11:59 and not a second later
she's stayin' in the mix like a crossfader
it's about to go down
no elevator
live for the moment
love in the air
she got me feeling like
i don't wanna be your player
real talk
so i don't wanna be unfair
now watch the apple drop
and celebrate the year
i see you shinin' away
from over there
and all the other girls
no, they don't compare
i whisper something bond to you
all up in your ear
i infiltrate your mind
and then i penetrate her
i get it crackin' baby
call me the ... lady


we're having a good day
let's make it a great night
you know i see you
and tell you you're so tight
my special lady
you're one of a kind
and every time i see you shine

on new year's eve
and i do believe
on new year's eve
we can live forever

grab a glass
make a toast to the good life
bacardi, lime and ciroc
it will pass the time
leather seats in the back of a phantom ride
you stay on my mind so i had to make you mine
master kush smoke for a master mind
my special lady
only one of a kind
i never seen it comin'
i guess love is blind
new year's watch the city come to life
i must say girl
you're looking right
your hair did, nails did, dress
fitting tight
i think i just might
see she's the one i like
see we can look forever girl
let's get hot one night


we're having a good day

and tell you you're so tight
my special lady

and every time i see you shine

on new year's eve
and i do believe
that you and me
we can live forever

smoking smoking weed
havin a party (bring the weed)
i'm going to invite her
i got my lighter (got a blunt)
i'm getting higher
smoking smoking weed


jumped out my bed and i head downstairs
wiped the boogers out my eyes. put some braids in my hair
grabbed my favorite toothbrush and then some crest
rinse my mouth out, now i'm ready for the rest
break it down, roll it up, pass if you've had enough
you're with the big boss dogg so go and puff puff
real talk, can you still walk?
have a seat, have a drink, now rest your feet
see that's the problem, you think that you can go with me?
smoking cest your whole life, now you wanna blow with me
go to the store with me and get some swishy sweet
and grab a bite to eat before you fall out
i'm a ball out and everyday, we're going to smoke until we all out
and that's a promise cuh, we got the bombest bud
and you can ask ray j, he knows what time it was
(smoking, smoking weed)


in the cadillac, with my head back
feeling real good cause it's like that
another 20' sack we've got plenty' that
we keep doing that


smoking smoking weed
smokin on these trees, keeps me at ease with these
crazy things i see
smokin on these trees, keeps me it seems
and i don't just where i'd be - smoking smoking weed


havin a party (bring the weed)
i'm going to invite her
i've got my lighter (got a blunt)
i'm getting higher
wish you would pass it (guess i'll wait)
i'm right beside her
i got an ashtray (at my place)
where did my pipe go?
