leather seats in the back of a phantom ride
you stay on my mind so i had to make you mine
master kush smoke for a master mind
my special lady

smoking smoking weed


jumped out my bed and i head downstairs
wiped the boogers out my eyes. put some braids in my hair
grabbed my favorite toothbrush and then some crest
rinse my mouth out, now i'm ready for the rest
break it down, roll it up, pass if you've had enough
you're with the big boss dogg so go and puff puff
real talk, can you still walk?
have a seat, have a drink, now rest your feet
see that's the problem, you think that you can go with me?
smoking cest your whole life, now you wanna blow with me
go to the store with me and get some swishy sweet
and grab a bite to eat before you fall out
i'm a ball out and everyday, we're going to smoke until we all out
and that's a promise cuh, we got the bombest bud
and you can ask ray j, he knows what time it was
(smoking, smoking weed)


in the cadillac, with my head back
feeling real good cause it's like that
another 20' sack we've got plenty' that
we keep doing that


smoking smoking weed
smokin on these trees, keeps me at ease with these
crazy things i see
smokin on these trees, keeps me it seems
and i don't just where i'd be - smoking smoking weed


havin a party (bring the weed)
i'm going to invite her
i've got my lighter (got a blunt)
i'm getting higher
wish you would pass it (guess i'll wait)
