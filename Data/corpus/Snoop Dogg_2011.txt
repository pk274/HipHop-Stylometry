owe it to the almighty, without you it couldn't be done
your praise put the rise of the son, you dig?
hold closer my hands from my throne
and i never be crucified within my own zone
here is a very good reason to show love
but you gotta separate grown man from grown thug

two sons, beautiful wife for starters
i did it all, jack, poppin' this peas

you sit here, in the bed where
a nigga just wanna put the head in, biatch



eyo battlecat, it's yo dogg
bigg snoopy d.o. double g
hey cuh
i was thinking...
we need to take it back to the way it used to be
you feel me?
yeah, c'mon, yeah drift with me, drift with me, c'mon, drift with me y'all


reflections of the way life used to be
it's all right


take it back to the afros and the naturals
cake cutter picks we slips into the back roads
i'm o.g. my nigga for real though
straight up off that east side top of the hill yo
i'm looking at the overview
thinking bout '86 damn i was overdue
walking in the hood making mix tapes trying to walk up out the hood
while i'm chucking at the hood nigga talk about the hood
that i came from it raised me real crip crazy
what up, oops a daisy
demon or a heathen, scheming while i'm dreaming
screaming to get even, seeing is believing
and don't you forget that
get it to you get back hit that kick back
three flies one a way
reminisce about the things that my grandmama use to say
stay in your own lane stay on your own and quit trying to be grown
day turn to night and play turn to fight
yeah i guess my granny was right


reflections of the way life used to be
it's all right


i like them girls from ladera heights or the girls on hills
i take a trip up the world on wheels and get in a fight
make it back to my ride
pop shots at some suckers disrespecting the side
my big homie my cuzzo schoolyard bozo
slid me away just to get me away
i'm just a long beach nigga outside of my hood
i'm banging riding but doing it good
when i get locked down there ain't hiding and wondering
as soon as i hit the county i'm up in 48 hundred
with the dealers the killers the realest
the best from the west and the beast from the east
yeah i'm acting a fool
i'm getting my degree from gladiator school
i chose this life cause i knows this life
sell a little crack and my flows is tight
i'm clear on my choice and what's cold is
i can still hear my grandma's voice
she say day turn to night and play turn to fight
yeah i guess my granny was right


reflections of the way life used to be
reminisce
it's all right


if you get caught then you don't walk cause you don't talk
and these was the rules squeeze on these fools
i came up in a different era homie
where the g's is the g's and the little wannabe's really want it
wanna be like cause the c life make you wanna g like
now who you wanna be like snoop
that fool on the tv screen
or the homie on the corner getting major cream
in the cadillac beating like battlecat
a nigga with money don't know how to act
smoke til your eyes get cataracts
all money nonsense yeah none of that
quarter sack run it back
hold him back lock him up bag him up front him that
if a trick jump the track do you want your money back
lil bitch was a bunny rat
watch for the funny hat
cause it's gonna come
and my granny said it's no fun
she say day turn to night and play turn to fight
yeah i guess my granny was right


reflections of the way life used to be
it's all right

i wake up early in the morning and it feels so good
smoking on some shit that you wish you could
jealousy envy, please don't feel bad
this weed is mine get your own bag
a sack full of og under locking key
none for the homies this is all for me
got a blunt looking like a cali palm tree
police roll by, i got nothing on me
cause the smoke is already in the air
i am loped up two braids in my hair
all star with the khaki suit
i'm gonna fuck around and take it to the classic snoop
on the east side standing on the vip
back then the only red was my dye
used to pyt and you're looking so fine
i am sorry baby girl but tonight


get back to the episode, sacks for the chronic
out of this world, could relax on a comet
this is church music listen to the choir
to burn my kush you must use fire
dogg like never heard before
smoking that bomb like thc-4
west coast world wide sea shore to sea shore
when is the last time you've seen a g in a g4
don't worry i'll wait
time is ticking i'm tripping
i'm slipping, i'll wait
into a zone where the whores on my dog bone
a dog whistle and they download my ring tone
and she so hypnotized by this pimp poem
what i got here is mine go get your own
i put this to rhymes get piece of mind
ozs to dimes and this weed is mine
