my kids is grown
and i'm still rocking on the microphone
people love me everywhere
and i know why
it's not that i'm dope and my style is so fly
james brown sat me down in a chair
and said, "snoopy, don't you ever cut your hair"
i was dazed and amazed
that's why i keep my shit in ponytails or either braids
when i was in school, i used to get cool grades
when i graduated, used to smoke two jays
with a fifth of seagrams
mixed with some sacco
then i got a caddy sack, just like them vatos
posted up six-one, yeah, that's the block though
ride by slow and get your ass popped, though
me and geeda, faith and terry, that's when rump was enough
can't forget tim, baby dog and half-dead
dre-loc was a 20 crip that showed me a lot of shit
but moving along, i went from a camaro to a fleetwood brougham
my sack in the back
my strap in my lap
room to the back
rolling through the neighborhood, checking my traps
as you get old, life like just might unfold
can't settle, this might be untold
twilight zone, live life long
smoke you a bone, and hit you a blunt
buy you a zo', and roll you a jay
and put it in the e-i

and lighters in the air, repeat after me
i’m too blowed, forever in a day

cake cutter picks we slips into the back roads
i'm o.g. my nigga for real though
straight up off that east side top of the hill yo
i'm looking at the overview
thinking bout '86 damn i was overdue
walking in the hood making mix tapes trying to walk up out the hood
while i'm chucking at the hood nigga talk about the hood
that i came from it raised me real crip crazy
what up, oops a daisy
demon or a heathen, scheming while i'm dreaming
screaming to get even, seeing is believing
and don't you forget that
get it to you get back hit that kick back
three flies one a way
reminisce about the things that my grandmama use to say
stay in your own lane stay on your own and quit trying to be grown
day turn to night and play turn to fight
yeah i guess my granny was right


reflections of the way life used to be
it's all right


i like them girls from ladera heights or the girls on hills
i take a trip up the world on wheels and get in a fight
make it back to my ride
pop shots at some suckers disrespecting the side
my big homie my cuzzo schoolyard bozo
slid me away just to get me away
i'm just a long beach nigga outside of my hood
i'm banging riding but doing it good
when i get locked down there ain't hiding and wondering
as soon as i hit the county i'm up in 48 hundred
with the dealers the killers the realest
the best from the west and the beast from the east
yeah i'm acting a fool
i'm getting my degree from gladiator school
i chose this life cause i knows this life
sell a little crack and my flows is tight
i'm clear on my choice and what's cold is
i can still hear my grandma's voice
she say day turn to night and play turn to fight
yeah i guess my granny was right


reflections of the way life used to be
reminisce
it's all right


if you get caught then you don't walk cause you don't talk
and these was the rules squeeze on these fools
i came up in a different era homie
where the g's is the g's and the little wannabe's really want it
wanna be like cause the c life make you wanna g like
now who you wanna be like snoop
that fool on the tv screen
or the homie on the corner getting major cream
in the cadillac beating like battlecat
a nigga with money don't know how to act
smoke til your eyes get cataracts
all money nonsense yeah none of that
quarter sack run it back
hold him back lock him up bag him up front him that
if a trick jump the track do you want your money back
lil bitch was a bunny rat
watch for the funny hat
cause it's gonna come
and my granny said it's no fun
she say day turn to night and play turn to fight
yeah i guess my granny was right


reflections of the way life used to be
it's all right

i wake up early in the morning and it feels so good
smoking on some shit that you wish you could
jealousy envy, please don't feel bad
this weed is mine get your own bag
a sack full of og under lock and key
none for the homies this is all for me
got a blunt looking like a cali palm tree
police roll by i got nothing on me
cause the smoke is already in the air
i'm rolled up with two braids in my hair
i'll start with the kaki sweet
i'm gonna fuck around and take it back to classic snoop
on the east side standing on the vip
back when my only red was me e-y-e

d-o double g like never heard before
smoking that bomb like thc4
west coast worldwide sea shore to sea shore
when is the last time you've seen a g in a g4?
don't worry i'll wait
time is ticking i'm tripping
i'm slipping away
into the zone where these hoes with they dogg on
a dogg whistle and they download my ring zone
and she is hypnotized by this pimp's poem
what i got here is mine go get your own
i put this to rhymes, get piece of mind
oz's to die for, this weed is mine
