back in the days on the boulevard of linden
we used to kick routines and the presence was fitting


i used to come through with the tools and glocks

i beat a nigga up out his shoes and socks
i used to come through with the tools and glocks
party don't rock like it used to rock
back door, nigga, i refuse to knock
i beat a nigga up out his shoes and socks


standin' amazing, hit you in the brain
get with snoop dogg, he can put you in the game
put you on the stage, maybe even front page
get a little fortune, have a little fame
kill 'em with class, toast to the boogie while you fill up your glass
so quick, so fast
no razzmatazz, i'm just an eastside nigga
with my gangster ass, twenties
i used to pinch pennies
only gs, i don't fuck with no weenies
my clique is sick, it expandin'
to outlaws, riders and bandits

i beat a nigga up out his shoes and socks
i used to come through with the tools and glocks
party don't rock like it used to rock

what's beef? 'cause beef is in the kitchen
what you want dog? i'm on a million-dollar mission
how can you get it if you ain't been through shit?
i'm just a seed that was planted by ruthless
my family tree is so g, we was cut from the cloth called lbc
crybaby, used to c-walk at the park
pitbulls on a leash that would never bark
real love, real dubs, real 'saniacs
trip locc, kinfolk, and wayniac
peace to the deceased that passed away
"duces 'n trayz: the old fashioned way"
what you gon' do
when we pull up in a hood near you?
you know


i used to come through with the tools and glocks
party don't rock like it used to rock
back door, nigga, i refuse to knock
i beat a nigga up out his shoes and socks

yeah, certified official gangsta shit
unfiltered, like a pack of humps, nigga
detrimental to all and any that disrespect or deviate from the g calls
it's either hog status or buster status
it ain't no in betweens
you can't wake up and put this on, nigga
every breath you breathe gotta be committed to this shit
clappin' niggas, tappin' switches, mackin' bitches
mansion business and stackin riches
it's all a part of that lifestyle we created back in the days for the world to follow
gs up, forever
the boss dogg an' tha general, front line and on the east side

you know there is always some big mouth-ass nigga talkin' shit. there's always some big mouth motherfucker hatin'. always a nigga hatin'. it's always somebody that's displeased with what you do. you can never make motherfuckers happy. there is always somebody unsatisfied that feels entitled. there is always some bitch on the sideline talkin' shit with her big mouth there is always some big mouth-ass nigga talkin' 'bout what you shoulda do with your money and what you coulda, woulda, shoulda - it's just... you understand me? big mouth with your big mouth ass!

there's a rumor being spread about me and my crew
about something we did or supposed to do
you might not of heard it or maybe you have
but when i first heard it all i did was laugh
i used to get angry and all uptight
you can say what you want, just spell my name right
cause all i'm ever guilty of is rockin' the house
but that's not what the rumor was all about
so if you like to hate tell all your friends
and if you don't wait until you see me again
this way i can hear it from the horses mouth
right then and there we can straighten it out
because i don't get involved with he said she said
so take my advice and quit while you ahead

not something that you run and tell your crew
but you had to told sharon and she told carol
then the story rolled on just like a wheelbarrow
carol told bibi and she told pam
and pam was overheard a-talking to her man
pam was so rookie, what she thought she heard
and somehow my nigga diddy bop got the word
he told somebody i knew from fruit town
they called me up and put me down
now the whole damn story's been changed around
and that's the reason why i ain't fucking with you now
'cause you never shoulda opened your mouth at all
and i wouldn't a had no reason to make this call

i got my head on a swivel, swivel
i got my head on a swivel


i'm in full beast mode, too cold to be cut down
lifting weights, staying in shape, won't be shut down
antonio brown or julio jones
one on each side, now who do you zone
they on me like a bloodhound cause i won't go down
it's like a merry-go-round the way i'm bending my routes
i'm so sick with this, they can't stick me
stick to to this
sports illustrated, get a flick of this
lost him, cross him, quarterback toss
highest point homie had the randy moss him
one hand as i shook him off me
some obj with a dab of that dj coffin, get off me


call a few plays then break the huddle
check that d, they in the zone no rebuttal
i can throw a strike down the pipe about 80
hand full of rings, i'm shady like brady


i can send a missile
i got my head on a swivel, swivel
i got my head on a swivel
eyes peeled when i wiggle
i got my head on a swivel, swivel
i got my head on a swivel
this is not a starter pistol (no, no)
i got my head on a swivel, swivel (yeah)
i got my head on a swivel
if you need me just whistle
i got my head on a swivel, swivel
i got my head on a swivel


if you play wing back, slot end, or receiver
you got to outwork your opponent or you won't receive a
pass from the quarterback cause he's under pressure
they get a couple 1db's about to press up
looking apart from the start, on the dress up
coach on the play, i'm hoping that he don't mess up
ayy back up off me, you playing me close
you bout to be hot buttered on a breakfast toast
i rock it out and find my way into the endzone
a couple cheerleaders want to be in my friendzone
i tell 'em "cool," i keep my head in the game
cause i'm ahead of the game and i'm a veteran man


call a few plays then break the huddle
check that d, they in the zone no rebuttal
i can throw a strike down the pipe about 80
hand full of rings, i'm shady like brady
