top of the morning, there's just something i wanted to address real quick. you know, there's a lot of people that didn't, like, really appreciate the unity walk yesterday. don't like peace and all that, and i understand. when i was out there, i didn't understand it either. they couldn't talk peace with me. they tried, and i was like, "nigga, that's schoolyard." you can't find a home in my generation that put in more work than me. you may find one or two that put in as much as me, but you ain't gon' find none that put in more than me. and i'm here to tell you that shit was worthless, bro. when they try to peace, i don't wanna peace. look where i'm at. this shit ain't cool, bro. crazy part of this, you go this way to me, two steps that way, you got 60s. you go two steps this way, you got bloods. we wait for each when we walk to trial, bro. we united in here. nigga might not hang with a nigga every day, but we know we got each other's backs. and i don't knock y'all out there that ain't with the peace, but don't get on people that are. some people's just tired of this shit, bro.


one blood, one cuz, now put them all together, we got one love
one blood, one cuz, now put them all together, we got one
one blood, one cuz, now put them all together, we got one love
one blood, one cuz, now put them all together, we got one


for god so loved the world he gave us a good crip
the late, great neighborhood nip
dippin' in this l.a. bullshit
'bout as solid of youngsta as a nigga could get (yup)
wasn't nothin' like these thug phonies
was always showin' love and big respect for all the blood homies (what up)
you understood the values in the youth
man, i swear to god, nephew, you was the truth
damn, how could this nigga do this?
it's 'cause every neighborhood jesus got a neighborhood judas
who hate to see your team ridin' rich
you see that envy and that pride, that's that green-eyed bitch
worse than a woman scorned (damn)
it had been better for that man if he had never been born
but mary, don't you mourn, martha, don't you weep
you see, your son still affected us deep
give us the faith to take that leap


one blood, one cuz, now put them all together, we got one love
one blood, one cuz, now put them all together, we got one
one blood, one cuz, now put them all together, we got one love
one blood, one cuz, now put them all together, we got one


all it take is one, one, one brave blood and one brave crip
standing up together like we did back on them slave ships
out on high sea waves, fighting other whips
steady hearing "jesus saves" out of devils lips
shackled at the hips for the color of our skin
hundreds of us, yeah, we knew we was brothers then
but here we go again, underneath the gun
they got us thinkin' we all different when we (one)
so i'm givin' thanks to the gangstas, givin' praise to the neighbors
damus and pirus, y'all got the whole world amazed
special shout out to the hoovers for showin us how it's done
ain't nothin' greater than when we unite as (one)
ain't got no ulterior motives and no other agendas
fakin' like you with us just like some puppet pretenders
we ready to end this
for every eye that still cries
it's time to realize god will rise when we tie us


one blood, one cuz, now put them all together, we got one love
one blood, one cuz, now put them all together, we got one
one blood, one cuz, now put them all together, we got one love
one blood, one cuz, now put them all together, we got one


one blood, one cuz, yeah
one blood, one cuz
now put them all together, you have one, one, one
one blood, one cuz
motherhood, brotherhood, ain't no other hood
just imagine if we all was one hood
now put them all together, you got one

so past the square, past the bridge
past the mills, now past the stacks
on another gathering storm
comes a tall handsome man
in a dusty black coat (say what?)
with a red right hand (say what, say what?)
did you hear what i said?
in a dusty black coat
with a red right hand


he'll wrap you up in his arms
tell you that you've been a good boy
he'll rekindle all the dreams it took you a lifetime to destroy
he'll reach deep into the hole
heal your shrinking soul
but there won't be a single thing that you can do
'cause he's a god
he's a god, he's a man
he's a ghost, he's a guru
they're whispering his name
through this disappearing land
but hidden in his coat
is a red right hand
yeah, red right hand


you don't have no money?
he'll get you some
you don't have a car? no car?
he'll get you one
you don't have no self-respect
you feel like an insect
well don't you worry buddy
'cause here he comes
through the ghettos and the barrios
and the bowery and the slums
a shadow is cast wherever he stands
stacks of green paper in his red right hand
stacks of green paper (yeah, money) in his red right hand


you'll see him in your nightmares
you'll see him in your dreams
he'll appear out of nowhere but
he ain't what he seems
you'll see him in your head
on the tv screen
and hey buddy, i'm warning you
turn it off
he's a ghost, he's a god
he's a man, he's a guru
you're one microscopic cog
in a catastrophic plan
designed and directed
directed, designed and directed
by his red right hand, yeah
red right hand

i would like to say to this gentleman and all other people who are not blessed with melanin at this point in time to understand that what has happened in our history is that you have been misinformed as much as we have been misinformed.
much of the information that is brought forth, not only from doctor mohammed, but other areas, other scholars, are not available to you as a sister said in your curriculum that you've had for 400 years when you did not allow us to read and write, it was being hidden.
whether you, sir, personally did that or not, it was a legacy that was passed onto you.
and i end by saying the holocaust is simply the greatest atrocity on film.
ours was not filmed.


what will it take for my peoples to connect together?
you know it's black excellence if we compete together
picture a photograph of black folks lit together
in high definition, in high, i would never
turn my back on the block, i got the block on my back
like james brown, boy, i'm proud to be black
to all my sisters, mother earth has birthed us
lurchers, it hurts us first, less heard this
to all my sisters, ain't no knockin' you back
politicans politickin' with a gown and a cap
the house got flavor and i like it like that

presidents meetin' overseas just to have a sitdown


they tryna keep us from runnin' up
i never tell you to get down, it's all about comin' up


the foundation was laid, y'all nation was made
off our ancestors' back, back, back in the day
four hundred years ago, y'all made us slaves
and you can hear it in the spirit comin' deep from the graves
life is a maze
smoke so much dope you in a daze
but you ain't trippin', you gettin' paid
who do you praise? but anyways
i read a history book, but i ain't learned nothin', dawg
so i read the bible, then the holy quran
went to jamaica to acquire my knowledge
sat with some rastas 'til my game got polished
the gangbang extreme with malice
trees and degrees like i'm trained for college


they tryna keep us from runnin' up
i never tell you to get down, it's all about comin' up

touch down on the west and soak the sun rays up
blow smoke out the six deuce
and pour another cup of that gin and juice (woo)

we gon' crash out on slauson, that nipsey blue
you never actin' funny style (never)
them veneers in your mouth, girl, you got a money smile (ching)
hold on like a tight grip (tight grip)
shakin' that ass, you turn me on like a light switch (woo, oh, no)


hand over your heart if you in love, baby
kissin' on your body 'til you can't take it
silencer on the gun, i'm locked and loaded
pedal to the metal, foot down and floor it
i won't say shit 'cause you hard-headed
as long as we together, whippin' it, aw yeah
girl, ain't nobody doin' it like papi chulo (oh-woah)
this a fiesta, pull your dress up when we're together (oh, na, na, hey)


psycho-disco, snoop-adellic
with the crypto-cash on me, you could smell it (smell it)
now breathe it in, wait to exhale, now breathe again
you smell like money, dressed to kill
wave my wand, we can disappear
in a cadillac spaceship
over the hills and palm trees to the matrix (cb)


yeah, snoop dogg, cb
haha, yeah
