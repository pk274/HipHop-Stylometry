i see your face in my mind as i drive away
'cause none of us thought it was gonna end that way
people are people and sometimes, we change our minds
but it's killing me to see you go after all this time


music starts playing like the end of a sad movie
it's the kind of ending you don't really wanna see
'cause it's tragedy and it'll only bring you down
now, i don't know what to be without you around


and we know it's never simple, never easy
never a clean break, no one here to save me
you're the only thing i know like the back of my hand


and i can't breathe without you, but i have to
breathe without you, but i have to


never wanted this, never wanna see you hurt
every little bump in the road, i tried to swerve
but people are people and sometimes, it doesn't work out
nothing we say is gonna save us from the fall out


and we know it's never simple, never easy
never a clean break, no one here to save me
you're the only thing i know like the back of my hand


and i can't breathe without you, but i have to
breathe without you but i have to


it's 2 a.m, feeling like i just lost a friend
hope you know it's not easy, easy for me
it's 2 a.m, feeling like i just lost a friend
hope you know this ain't easy, easy for me


and we know it's never simple, never easy
never a clean break, no one here to save me, oh-oh


i can't breathe without you, but i have to
breathe without you, but i have to
breathe without you, but i have to


i'm sorry, i'm sorry (mmm)
i'm sorry, (yeah, yeah) i'm sorry
i'm sorry, i'm sorry
i'm sorry

it was painted red, the stripe was white
it was 18 feet from bow to stern light
secondhand from a dealer in atlanta
i rode up with daddy when he went there to get her
we put on a shine, put on a motor
built out of love, and made for the water
ran her for years, until the transom got rotten
a piece of my childhood will never be forgotten


it was just an old plywood boat
75 johnson and an electric choke
a young girl, two hands on the wheel
i can't replace the way it made me feel
and i would turn her sharp
i would make it whine
he'd say, "you can't beat the way a old wood boat rides"
just a little lake across the alabama line
but i was king of the ocean
when daddy let me drive


just an old half ton short bed ford
my uncle bought new in '64
daddy got it right cause the engine was smoking
a couple burnt valves and he had it going
he'd let me drive her when we haul off a load
down a dirt strip, we'd haul trash off of thigpen road
i'd sit up in the seat and stretch my feet out to the pedals
smiling like a hero who just received his medal


it was just an old hand-me-down ford
with 3 speed on the column and a dent in the door
a young girl, two hands on the wheel
i can't replace the way it made me feel and
i would press that clutch
and i would keep it right
he would say a little slower, girl
you're doing just fine
just a dirt road with trash on each side
but i was mario andretti
when daddy let me drive


soon i'll be grown up
with daughters of my own
i let them drive my old jeep
across the pasture at our home
maybe one day they'll reach back in their file
and pull out that old memory
and think of me and smile
and say


it was just an old worn out jeep
rusty old floor boards
hot on my feet
a young girl, two hands on the wheel
i can't replace the way it made me feel
and he'd say
steer it left, and turn it right
straighten up girl now, you're doing just fine
just a little valley by the river where we'd ride
but i was high on a mountain
when daddy let me drive
oh, he let me drive
oh, he let me drive


it's just an old plywood boat
with a 75 johnson
and electric choke

there's something 'bout the way
the street looks when it's just rained
there's a glow off the pavement, you walk me to the car
and you know i wanna ask you to dance right there
in the middle of the parking lot, yeah
oh, yeah


we're driving down the road, i wonder if you know
i'm trying so hard not to get caught up now
but you're just so cool, run your hands through your hair
absentmindedly making me want you


and i don't know how it gets better than this
you take my hand and drag me head first, fearless
and i don't know why but with you, i'd dance
in a storm in my best dress, fearless


so, baby, drive slow 'til we run out of road
in this one horse town, i wanna stay right here
in this passenger's seat
you put your eyes on me
in this moment now, capture it, remember it


'cause i don't know how it gets better than this
you take my hand and drag me head first, fearless
and i don't know why but with you, i'd dance
in a storm in my best dress, fearless


well, you stood there with me in the doorway
my hands shake, i'm not usually this way but
you pull me in and i'm a little more brave
it's the first kiss, it's flawless, really something
it's fearless
oh, yeah


'cause i don't know how it gets better than this
you take my hand and drag me head first, fearless
and i don't know why but with you, i'd dance
in a storm in my best dress, fearless
'cause i don't know how it gets better than this
you take my hand and drag me head first, fearless
and i don't know why but with you, i'd dance
in a storm in my best dress, fearless


oh, oh
oh, yeah

you take a deep breath and you walk through the doors
it's the mornin' of your very first day
you say "hi" to your friends you ain't seen in a while
try and stay out of everybody's way
it's your freshman year and you're gonna be here
for the next four years in this town
hopin' one of those senior boys will wink at you and say
"you know, i haven't seen you around before"


'cause when you're fifteen and somebody tells you they love you
you're gonna believe them
and when you're fifteen, feelin' like there's nothin' to figure out
well, count to ten, take it in
this is life before you know who you're gonna be
fifteen


you sit in class next to a redhead named abigail
and soon enough, you're best friends
laughin' at the other girls who think they're so cool
we'll be outta here as soon as we can
and then, you're on your very first date and he's got a car
and you're feelin' like flyin'
and your mama's waitin' up and you're thinkin' he's the one
and you're dancin' 'round your room when the night ends
when the night ends


'cause when you're fifteen and somebody tells you they love you
you're gonna believe them
and when you're fifteen and your first kiss
makes your head spin 'round
but in your life, you'll do things greater than
dating the boy on the football team
but i didn't know it at fifteen


when all you wanted was to be wanted
wish you could go back and tell yourself what you know now
back then, i swore i was gonna marry him someday
but i realized some bigger dreams of mine
and abigail gave everything she had
to a boy who changed his mind
and we both cried


'cause when you're fifteen and somebody tells you they love you
you're gonna believe them
and when you're fifteen, don't forget to look before you fall
i've found time can heal most anything
and you just might find who you're supposed to be
i didn't know who i was supposed to be
at fifteen


la-la-la, la-la-la, la-la-la-la
la-la-la, la-la-la, la-la-la-la
la-la-la, la-la-la


your very first day
take a deep breath, girl
take a deep breath as you walk through the doors

once upon a time
i believe it was a tuesday when i caught your eye
and we caught onto something
i hold onto the night
you looked me in the eye and told me you loved me
were you just kidding?
'cause it seems to me
this thing is breaking down, we almost never speak
i don't feel welcome anymore
baby, what happened? please, tell me
'cause one second, it was perfect
now, you're halfway out the door


and i stare at the phone, he still hasn't called
and then you feel so low you can't feel nothing at all
and you flashback to when he said, "forever and always"
oh, and it rains in your bedroom
everything is wrong
it rains when you're here and it rains when you're gone
'cause i was there when you said, "forever and always"


was i out of line?
did i say something way too honest, made you run and hide
like a scared little boy?
i looked into your eyes
thought i knew you for a minute, now, i'm not so sure
so here's to everything coming down to nothing
here's to silence that cuts me to the core
where is this going?
thought i knew for a minute, but i don't anymore


and i stare at the phone, he still hasn't called
and then you feel so low you can't feel nothing at all
and you flashback to when he said, "forever and always"
oh, and it rains in your bedroom
everything is wrong
it rains when you're here and it rains when you're gone
'cause i was there when you said, "forever and always"
you didn't mean it, baby, i don't think so


oh, back up, baby, back up
did you forget everything?
back up, baby, back up
did you forget everything?


'cause it rains in your bedroom
everything is wrong
it rains when you're here and it rains when you're gone
'cause i was there when you said, "forever and always"
oh, i stare at the phone, he still hasn't called
and then you feel so low you can't feel nothing at all
and you flashback to when we said, "forever and always"
and it rains in your bedroom
everything is wrong
it rains when you're here and it rains when you're gone
'cause i was there when you said, "forever and always"


you didn't mean it, baby
you said, "forever and always", yeah

mmm-mm, mm-mm
mmm-mm, mm-mm
mmm-mm, mm-mm, yeah


hey, stephen, i know looks can be deceiving
but i know i saw a light in you
and as we walked, we were talking
i didn't say half the things i wanted to
of all the girls tossing rocks at your window
i'll be the one waiting there even when it's cold
hey, stephen, boy, you might have me believing
i don't always have to be alone


'cause i can't help it if you look like an angel
can't help it if i wanna kiss you in the rain so
come feel this magic i've been feeling since i met you
can't help it if there's no one else
mmm, i can't help myself


hey, stephen, i've been holding back this feeling
so i got some things to say to you, ha
i've seen it all, so i thought
but i never seen nobody shine the way you do
the way you walk, way you talk, way you say my name
it's beautiful, wonderful, don't you ever change
hey, stephen, why are people always leaving?
i think you and i should stay the same


'cause i can't help it if you look like an angel
can't help it if i wanna kiss you in the rain so
come feel this magic i've been feeling since i met you
can't help it if there's no one else
mmm, i can't help myself


they're dimming the street lights, you're perfect for me
why aren't you here tonight?
i'm waiting alone now, so come on and come out
and pull me near and shine, shine, shine


i can't help it if you look like an angel
can't help it if i wanna kiss you in the rain so
come feel this magic i've been feeling since i met you
can't help it if there's no one else
mmm, i can't help myself
if you look like an angel
can't help it if i wanna kiss you in the rain so
come feel this magic i've been feeling since i met you
can't help it if there's no one else
mmm, i can't help myself


myself
can't help myself
i can't help myself

wish i had concentrated
they said love was complicated
but it's something i just fell into
and it was overrated
but just look what i've created
i came out alive but i'm black and blue


before you ask me if i’m alright
think about what i had to do, yeah


wake up and smell the breakup
fix my heart, put on my makeup
another mess i didn't plan
and i'll bet you thought you'd beat me
wish you could only see
i got an "i heart question mark"
written on the back of my hand


i'd be fine if you just walked by
but you had to talk about why
you were wrong and i was right
but i can't believe you made me
sit at home, cry like a baby
wait right by the phone every night


and now you ask about you and i
there's no you and i
remember what you put me through, i had to


wake up and smell the breakup
fix my heart, put on my makeup
another mess i didn't plan
and i'll bet you thought you'd beat me
wish you could only see
i got an "i heart question mark"
written on the back of my hand


and when you're home all alone at night
you'll still wonder why
you took everything i had, oh, baby
i haven't thought about you and i
there's no you and i
and i know someday you will


wake up and smell the breakup
realize that we won't make up
it didn't go the way you planned
and you'll know you didn't beat me
when you look down and see
i got an "i heart question mark"
written on the back of my hand


written on the back of my hand
an "i heart question mark," yeah
written on the back of my hand

we were both young when i first saw you
i close my eyes and the flashback starts
i'm standing there
on a balcony in summer air
see the lights, see the party, the ball gowns
see you make your way through the crowd
and say, "hello"
little did i know


that you were romeo, you were throwing pebbles
and my daddy said, "stay away from juliet"
and i was crying on the staircase
begging you, "please don't go," and i said


romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone
i'll be waiting, all there's left to do is run
you'll be the prince and i'll be the princess
it's a love story, baby, just say, "yes"


so i sneak out to the garden to see you
we keep quiet 'cause we're dead if they knew
so close your eyes
escape this town for a little while, oh, oh


'cause you were romeo, i was a scarlet letter
and my daddy said, "stay away from juliet"
but you were everything to me
i was begging you, "please don't go," and i said


romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone
i'll be waiting, all there's left to do is run
you'll be the prince and i'll be the princess
it's a love story, baby, just say, "yes"
romeo, save me, they're trying to tell me how to feel
this love is difficult, but it's real
don't be afraid, we'll make it out of this mess
it's a love story, baby, just say, "yes"


oh, oh


but i got tired of waiting
wondering if you were ever coming around
my faith in you was fading
when i met you on the outskirts of town and i said


"romeo, save me, i've been feeling so alone
i keep waiting for you, but you never come
is this in my head? i don't know what to think"
he knelt to the ground and pulled out a ring, and said
"marry me, juliet, you'll never have to be alone
i love you and that's all i really know
i talked to your dad, go pick out a white dress
it's a love story, baby, just say 'yes'"


oh, oh, oh
oh, oh, oh
'cause we were both young when i first saw you

that you were romeo, you were throwing pebbles
and my daddy said, "stay away from juliet"
and i was crying on the staircase
begging you, "please don't go," and i said


romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone
i'll bе waiting, all there's left to do is run
you'll bе the prince and i'll be the princess
it's a love story, baby, just say, "yes"


so i sneak out to the garden to see you
we keep quiet 'cause we're dead if they knew
so close your eyes
escape this town for a little while, oh, oh


'cause you were romeo, i was a scarlet letter
and my daddy said, "stay away from juliet"
but you were everything to me

oh, oh


but i got tired of waiting
wondering if you were ever coming around
my faith in you was fading
when i met you on the outskirts of town and i said


"romeo, save me, i've been feeling so alone
i keep waiting for you, but you never come

he knelt to the ground and pulled out a ring, and said
"marry me, juliet, you'll never have to be alone
i love you and that's all i really know
i talked to your dad, go pick out a white dress
it's a love story, baby, just say 'yes'"


oh, oh, oh
oh, oh, oh
'cause we were both young when i first saw you

i took a chance, i took a shot
and you might think i'm bulletproof, but i'm not
you took a swing, i took it hard
and down here from the ground, i see who you are


i'm sick and tired of your attitude
i'm feeling like i don't know you
you tell me that you love me, then cut me down
and i need you like a heartbeat
but you know you got a mean streak
that makes me run for cover when you're around
and here's to you and your temper
yes, i remember what you said last night
and i know that you see what you're doing to me
tell me why


you could write a book on how to ruin someone's perfect day
well, i get so confused and frustrated
forget what i'm trying to say, oh


i'm sick and tired of your reasons
i got no one to believe in
you tell me that you want me, then push me around
and i need you like a heartbeat
but you know you got a mean streak
that makes me run for cover when you're around
here's to you and your temper
yes, i remember what you said last night
and i know that you see what you're doing to me
tell me why


why do you have to make me feel small
so you can feel whole inside?
why do you have to put down my dreams
so you're the only thing on my mind?


i'm sick and tired of your attitude
i'm feeling like i don't know you
you tell me that you want me, then cut me down
i'm sick and tired of your reasons
i've got no one to believe in
you ask me for my love, then you push me around
here's to you and your temper
yes, i remember what you said last night
and i know that you see what you're doing to me
tell me why (why)
tell me why (why)


i take a step back, let you go
i told you i'm not bulletproof
now you know

i'm five years old, it's getting cold, i've got my big coat on
i hear your laugh and look up smiling at you, i run and run
past the pumpkin patch and the tractor rides
look now, the sky is gold
i hug your legs and fall asleep on the way home


i don't know why all the trees change in the fall
but i know you're not scared of anything at all
don't know if snow white's house is near or far away
but i know i had the best day with you today


i'm thirteen now
and don't know how my friends could be so mean
i come home crying and you hold me tight and grab the keys
and we drive and drive until we found a town far enough away
and we talk and window shop 'til i've forgotten all their names


i don't know who i'm going to talk to now at school
but i know i'm laughing on the car ride home with you
don't know how long it's going to take to feel okay
but i know i had the best day with you today


i have an excellent father, his strength is making me stronger
god smiles on my little brother, inside and out
he's better than i am
i grew up in a pretty house and i had space to run
and i had the best days with you


there is a video i found from back when i was three
you set up a paint set in the kitchen and you're talking to me
it's the age of princesses and pirate ships and the seven dwarfs
and daddy's smart
and you're the prettiest lady in the whole wide world


and now, i know why all the trees change in the fall
i know you were on my side even when i was wrong
and i love you for giving me your eyes
for staying back and watching me shine
and i didn't know if you knew, so i'm taking this chance to say
that i had the best day with you today

he is sensible and so incredible
and all my single friends are jealous
he says everything i need to hear and it's like
i couldn't ask for anything better
he opens up my door and i get into his car
and he says you look beautiful tonight
and i feel perfectly fine


but i miss screaming and fighting and kissing in the rain
and it's 2am and i'm cursing your name
you're so in love that you act insane
and that's the way i loved you
breaking down and coming undone
it's a roller coaster kind of rush
and i never knew i could feel that much
and that's the way i loved you


he respects my space
and never makes me wait
and he calls exactly when he says he will
he's close to my mother
talks business with my father
he's charming and endearing
and i'm comfortable


but i miss screaming and fighting and kissing in the rain
and it's 2am and i'm cursing your name
you're so in love that you acted insane
and that's the way i loved you
breaking down and coming undone
it's a roller coaster kind of rush
and i never knew i could feel that much
and that's the way i loved you


he can't see the smile i'm faking
and my heart's not breaking
'cause i'm not feeling anything at all
and you were wild and crazy
just so frustrating
intoxicating, complicated
got away by some mistake and now


i miss screaming and fighting and kissing in the rain
it's 2am and i'm cursing your name
i'm so in love that i acted insane
and that's the way i loved you
breaking down and coming undone
it's a roller coaster kind of rush
and i never knew i could feel that much
and that's the way i loved you, oh, oh


and that's the way i loved you, oh, oh
never knew i could feel that much
and that's the way i loved you

say you're sorry, that face of an angel
comes out just when you need it to
as i paced back and forth all this time
'cause i honestly believed in you
holdin' on, the days drag on
stupid girl, i shoulda known, i shoulda known


that i'm not a princess, this ain't a fairytale
i'm not the one you'll sweep off her feet, lead her up the stairwell
this ain't hollywood, this is a small town
i was a dreamer before you went and let me down
now, it's too late for you and your white horse
to come around


maybe i was naive, got lost in your eyes
and never really had a chance
my mistake, i didn't know to be in love
you had to fight to have the upper hand
i had so many dreams about you and me
happy endings, now, i know


that i'm not a princess, this ain't a fairytale
i'm not the one you'll sweep off her feet, lead her up the stairwell
this ain't hollywood, this is a small town
i was a dreamer before you went and let me down
now, it's too late for you and your white horse
to come around


and there you are on your knees
beggin' for forgiveness, beggin' for me
just like i always wanted
but i'm so sorry


'cause i'm not your princess, this ain't our fairytale
i'm gonna find someone someday who might actually treat me well
this is a big world, that was a small town
there in my rear view mirror disappearing now
and it's too late for you and your white horse
now, it's too late for you and your white horse
to catch me now


oh, whoa, whoa, whoa
try and catch me now, oh
it's too late to catch me now

you're on the phone with your girlfriend, she's upset
she's going off about something that you said
'cause she doesn't get your humor like i do
i'm in the room, it's a typical tuesday night
i'm listening to the kind of music she doesn't like
and she'll never know your story like i do


but she wears short skirts, i wear t-shirts
she's cheer captain and i'm on the bleachers
dreaming 'bout the day when you wake up and find
that what you're looking for has been here the whole time


if you could see that i'm the one who understands you
been here all along, so why can't you see?
you belong with me, you belong with me


walking the streets with you and your worn-out jeans
i can't help thinking this is how it ought to be
laughing on a park bench, thinking to myself
hey, isn't this easy?
and you've got a smile that could light up this whole town
i haven't seen it in a while since she brought you down
you say you're fine, i know you better than that
hey, whatcha doing with a girl like that?


she wears high heels, i wear sneakers
she's cheer captain and i'm on the bleachers
dreaming 'bout the day when you wake up and find
that what you're looking for has been here the whole time


if you could see that i'm the one who understands you
been here all along, so why can't you see?
you belong with me
standing by and waiting at your back door
all this time, how could you not know, baby?
you belong with me, you belong with me


oh, i remember you driving to my house
in the middle of the night
i'm the one who makes you laugh
when you know you're 'bout to cry
and i know your favorite songs
and you tell me 'bout your dreams
think i know where you belong
think i know it's with me


can't you see that i'm the one who understands you
been here all along, so why can't you see?
you belong with me
standing by and waiting at your back door
all this time, how could you not know, baby?
you belong with me, you belong with me


you belong with me
have you ever thought just maybe
you belong with me?
you belong with me

all this time i was wasting hoping you would come around
i've been giving out chances every time and all you do is let me down
and it's taken me this long, baby, but i've figured you out
and you're thinking we'll be fine again, but not this time around


you don't have to call anymore
i won't pick up the phone
this is the last straw
don't wanna hurt anymore
and you can tell me that you're sorry
but i don't believe you, baby, like i did before
you're not sorry (no, no, no, no)


you're looking so innocent, i might believe you if i didn't know
could've loved you all my life if you hadn't left me waiting in the cold
and you've got your share of secrets
and i'm tired of being last to know, oh
and now, you're asking me to listen 'cause it's worked each time before


but you don't have to call anymore
i won't pick up the phone
this is the last straw
don't wanna hurt anymore
and you can tell me that you're sorry
but i don't believe you, baby, like i did before
you're not sorry (no, no, no, no)
you're not sorry (no, no, no, no)


you had me crawling for you, honey, and it never would've gone away, no
you used to shine so bright, but i watched all of it fade


so you don't have to call anymore
i won't pick up the phone
this is the last straw
there's nothing left to beg for
and you can tell me that you're sorry
but i don't believe you, baby, like i did before
you're not sorry (no, no, no, no)
you're not sorry (no, no, no, no)
(no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no)
woah, oh, oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
(oh, oh, oh, no, no, no, no, no, no)
