the way you look, the way you laugh
the way you love with all you have
there aren’t nothing about you that don't do something for me


once i thought that love was something i could never do
never knew that i could feel this much
but this yearning in the deep part of my heart for you
is more than a reaction to your touch
it's a perfect passion and i can't get enough


the way you look, the way you laugh
the way you love with all you have
there aren’t nothing about you that don't do something for me
the way you kiss, the way you cry
the way you move when you walk by
there's aren’t nothing about you (there aren’t nothing about you)
that don't do something for me

whoa


in my life i've been hammered by some heavy blows
that never knocked me off my feet
all you got to do is smile at me and down i go
and baby it's no mystery why i surrender
girl you got everything


the way you look, the way you laugh
the way you love with all you have
there aren’t nothing about you that don't do something for me
the way you kiss, the way you cry
the way you move when you walk by
there's aren’t nothing about you (there aren’t nothing about you)
that don't do something for me
i love your attitude, your rose tattoo, your every thought
your smile, you lips and girl the list goes on and on and on


the way you look, the way you laugh
the way you love with all you have
there aren’t nothing about you that don't do something for me
the way you kiss, the way you cry
the way you move when you walk by
there's aren’t nothing about you (there aren’t nothing about you)
that don't do something for me


the way you look, the way you laugh
the way you love with all you have
your dance, your drive, you make me feel alive


the way you talk, the way you tease
by now i think you see that
there aren’t nothing about you that don't do something for me

i'm so glad you made time to see me
how's life? tell me, how's your family?
i haven't seen them in a while
you've been good, busier than ever
we small talk, work and the weather
your guard is up and i know why


because the last time you saw me
is still burned in the back of your mind
you gave me roses and i left them there to die


so this is me swallowing my pride
standin' in front of you sayin', "i'm sorry for that night"
and i go back to december all the time
it turns out freedom ain't nothing but missin' you
wishin' i'd realized what i had when you were mine
i go back to december, turn around and make it alright
i go back to december all the time


these days, i haven't been sleeping
stayin' up, playing back myself leavin'
when your birthday passed and i didn't call
then i think about summer, all the beautiful times
i watched you laughing from the passenger side
and realized i loved you in the fall


and then the cold came, the dark days
when fear crept into my mind
you gave me all your love and all i gave you was goodbye


so this is me swallowing my pride
standin' in front of you, sayin', "i'm sorry for that night"
and i go back to december all the time
it turns out freedom ain't nothing but missin' you
wishin' i'd realized what i had when you were mine
i go back to december, turn around and change my own mind
i go back to december all the time


i miss your tanned skin, your sweet smile
so good to me, so right
and how you held me in your arms that september night
the first time you ever saw me cry
maybe this is wishful thinkin'
probably mindless dreaming
but if we loved again, i swear i'd love you right
i'd go back in time and change it, but i can't
so, if the chain is on your door, i understand


but this is me swallowing my pride
standin' in front of you, sayin', "i'm sorry for that night"
and i go back to december
it turns out freedom ain't nothing but missin' you
wishin' i'd realized what i had when you were mine
i go back to december, turn around and make it alright
i go back to december, turn around and change my own mind
i go back to december all the time


all the time

all the time

now, go stand in the corner and think about what you did (ha)
haha, time for a little revenge


the story starts when it was hot and it was summer and
i had it all, i had him right there where i wanted him
she came along, got him alone, and let's hear the applause
she took him faster than you can say "sabotage"
i never saw it coming, wouldn't have suspected it
i underestimated just who i was dealing with
she had to know the pain was beating on me like a drum
she underestimated just who she was stealing from


she's not a saint and she's not what you think
she's an actress, woah
she's better known for the things that she does
on the mattress, woah
soon, she's gonna find stealing other people's toys
on the playground won't make you many friends
she should keep in mind, she should keep in mind
there is nothing i do better than revenge, ha


she looks at life like it's a party and she's on the list
she looks at me like i'm a trend and she's so over it
i think her ever-present frown is a little troubling and
she thinks i'm psycho 'cause i like to rhyme her name with things
but sophistication isn't what you wear or who you know
or pushing people down to get you where you wanna go
oh, they didn't teach you that in prep school so it's up to me
but no amount of vintage dresses gives you dignity
(think about what you did)


she's not a saint and she's not what you think
she's an actress, woah
she's better known for the things that she does
on the mattress, woah
soon, she's gonna find stealing other people's toys
on the playground won't make you many friends
she should keep in mind, she should keep in mind
there is nothing i do better than revenge, ha


i'm just another thing for you to roll your eyes at, honey
you might have him, but haven't you heard?
i'm just another thing for you to roll your eyes at, honey
you might have him, but i always get the last word
woah, woah-ah-oh


she's not a saint and she's not what you think
she's an actress, woah (she deserved it)
she's better known for the things that she does
on the mattress, woah
soon, she's gonna find stealing other people's toys
on the playground won't make you many friends
she should keep in mind, she should keep in mind
there is nothing i do better than revenge


do you still feel like you know what you're doing?
'cause i don't think you do, oh (no, no, no, no)
do you still feel like you know what you're doing? (no)
i don't think you do, i don't think you do
let's hear the applause (come on, come on)
come on, show me how much better you are
(so much better, yeah?)
see, you deserve some applause
'cause you're so much better
she took him faster than you could say "sabotage"

long were the nights when
my days once revolved around you
counting my footsteps
praying the floor won't fall through again
and my mother accused me of losing my mind
but i swore i was fine
you paint me a blue sky
then go back and turn it to rain
and i lived in your chess game
but you changed the rules everyday
wondering which version of you i might get on the phone tonight
well, i stopped pickin' up and this song is to let you know why


dear john, i see it all now that you're gone
don't you think i was too young to be messed with?
the girl in the dress cried the whole way home
i should've known


well, maybe it's me
and my blind optimism to blame
or maybe it's you and your sick need
to give love and take it away
and you'll add my name to your long list of traitors
who don't understand
and i look back in regret how i ignored when they said
"run as fast as you can"


dear john, i see it all now that you're gone
don't you think i was too young to be messed with?
the girl in the dress cried the whole way home
dear john, i see it all now, it was wrong
don't you think nineteen's too young
to be played by your dark, twisted games when i loved you so?
i should've known


you are an expert at sorry and keeping lines blurry
never impressed by me acing your tests
all the girls that you've run dry have tired lifeless eyes
'cause you burned them out
but i took your matches before fire could catch me
so don't look now
i'm shining like fireworks over your sad empty town
oh, oh


dear john, i see it all now that you're gone
don't you think i was too young to be messed with?
the girl in the dress cried the whole way home
i see it all now that you're gone
don't you think i was too young to be messed with?
the girl in the dress wrote you a song
you should've known


you should've known
don't you think i was too young?
you should've known

there i was again tonight
forcing laughter, faking smiles
same old tired, lonely place
walls of insincerity
shifting eyes and vacancy
vanished when i saw your face
all i can say is it was enchanting to meet you


your eyes whispered, "have we met?"
across the room, your silhouette
starts to make its way to me
the playful conversation starts
counter all your quick remarks
like passing notes in secrecy
and it was enchanting to meet you
all i can say is i was enchanted to meet you


this night is sparklin', don't you let it go
i'm wonderstruck, blushin' all the way home
i'll spend forever wonderin' if you knew
i was enchanted to meet you


the lingering question kept me up
2am, who do you love?
i wonder 'til i'm wide awake
and now, i'm pacing back and forth
wishing you were at my door
i'd open up and you would say
"hey, it was enchanting to meet you"
all i know is i was enchanted to meet you


this night is sparklin', don't you let it go
i'm wonderstruck, blushin' all the way home
i'll spend forever wonderin' if you knew
this night is flawless, don't you let it go
i'm wonderstruck, dancing around all alone
i'll spend forever wonderin' if you knew
i was enchanted to meet you


this is me praying that
this was the very first page
not where the storyline ends
my thoughts will echo your name
until i see you again
these are the words i held back
as i was leaving too soon
i was enchanted to meet you
please, don't be in love with someone else
please, don't have somebody waiting on you
please, don't be in love with someone else (ooh)
please, don't have somebody waiting on you (ooh, oh)


this night is sparklin', don't you let it go
i'm wonderstruck, blushin' all the way home
i'll spend forever wonderin' if you knew
this night is flawless (please, don't be in love with someone else)
don't you let it go
i'm wonderstruck (please, don't have somebody waiting on you)
dancing around all alone
i'll spend forever (please, don't be in love with someone else)
wonderin' if you knew
i was enchanted to meet you


please, don't be in love with someone else
please, don't have somebody waiting on you

you and i walk a fragile line
i have known it all this time
but i never thought i'd live to see it break
it's getting dark and it's all too quiet
and i can't trust anything now
and it's coming over you like it's all a big mistake


woah, holding my breath
won't lose you again
something's made your eyes go cold


come on, come on, don't leave me like this
i thought i had you figured out
something's gone terribly wrong
you're all i wanted
come on, come on, don't leave me like this
i thought i had you figured out
can't breathe whenever you're gone
can't turn back now, i'm haunted


stood there and watched you walk away
from everything we had
but i still mean every word i said to you
he will try to take away my pain
and he just might make me smile
but the whole time, i'm wishing he was you instead


oh, holding my breath
won't see you again
something keeps me holding onto nothing


come on, come on, don't leave me like this
i thought i had you figured out
something's gone terribly wrong
you're all i wanted
come on, come on, don't leave me like this
i thought i had you figured out
can't breathe whenever you're gone
can't turn back now, i'm haunted


i know, i know
i just know
you're not gone
you can't be gone, no


come on, come on, don't leave me like this
i thought i had you figured out
something's gone terribly wrong
won't finish what you started
come on, come on, don't leave me like this
i thought i had you figured out
can't breathe whenever you're gone
i can't go back, i'm haunted


oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh
you and i walk a fragile line
i have known it all this time
never ever thought i'd see it break
never thought i'd see it

last night, i heard my own heart beating
sounded like footsteps on my stairs
six months gone and i'm still reaching
even though i know you're not there
i was playing back a thousand memories, baby
thinking 'bout everything we've been through
maybe i've been going back too much lately
when time stood still and i had you


come back, come back, come back to me like
you would, you would if this was a movie
stand in the rain outside 'til i came out
come back, come back, come back to me like
you could, you could if you just said you're sorry
i know that we could work it out somehow
but if this was a movie, you'd be here by now


i know people change and these things happen
but i remember how it was back then
wrapped up in your arms and our friends were laughin'
'cause nothing like this ever happened to them
now i'm pacing down the hall, chasing down your street
flashback to the night when you said to me
that nothing's gonna change, not for me and you
back before i knew how much i had to lose


come back, come back, come back to me like
you would, you would if this was a movie
stand in the rain outside 'til i came out
come back, come back, come back to me like
you could, you could if you just said you're sorry
i know that we could work it out somehow
but if this was a movie, you'd be here by now


if you're out there, if you're somewhere, if you're moving on
i've been waiting for you every day since you've been gone
i just want it back the way it was before
and i just wanna see you back at my front door


come back, come back, come back to me like
you would, you would if this was a movie
stand in the rain outside 'til i came out
come back, come back, come back to me like
you could, you could if you just said you're sorry
i know that we could work it out somehow
but if this was a movie, you'd be here by now


you'd be here by now
it's not the kind of ending you wanna see now
baby, what about the ending?
oh, i thought you'd be here by now
oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
thought you'd be here by now

i guess you really did it this time
left yourself in your war path
lost your balance on a tightrope
lost your mind trying to get it back


wasn't it easier in your lunchbox days?
always a bigger bed to crawl into
wasn't it beautiful when you believed in everything
and everybody believed in you?


it's alright, just wait and see
your string of lights is still bright to me, oh
who you are is not where you've been
you're still an innocent
you're still an innocent


did some things you can't speak of
but at night, you live it all again
you wouldn't be shattered on the floor now
if only you had seen what you know now then


wasn't it easier in your firefly-catching days?
when everything out of reach
someone bigger brought down to you
wasn't it beautiful running wild 'til you fell asleep
before the monsters caught up to you?


it's alright, just wait and see
your string of lights is still bright to me, oh
who you are is not where you've been
you're still an innocent
it's okay, life is a tough crowd
thirty-two and still growing up now
who you are is not what you did
you're still an innocent


time turns flames to embers
you'll have new septembers
every one of us has messed up, too, ooh
minds change like the weather
i hope you remember
today is never too late to be brand new, oh


it's alright, just wait and see
your string of lights is still bright to me, oh
who you are is not where you've been
you're still an innocent
it's okay, life is a tough crowd
thirty-two and still growing up now
who you are is not what you did
you're still an innocent
you're still an innocent


lost your balance on a tightrope, oh
it's never too late to get it back

i still remember the look on your face
lit through the darkness at 1:58
the words that you whispered for just us to know
you told me you loved me, so why did you go away?
away


i do recall now, the smell of the rain
fresh on the pavement, i ran off the plane
that july ninth, the beat of your heart
it jumps through your shirt, i can still feel your arms


but now i'll go
sit on the floor wearing your clothes
all that i know is i don't know
how to be something you miss


i never thought we'd have a last kiss
i never imagined we'd end like this
your name, forever the name on my lips


i do remember the swing of your step
the life of the party, you're showing off again
and i'd roll my eyes and then you'd pull me in
i'm not much for dancing, but for you, i did
because i love your handshake, meeting my father
i love how you walk with your hands in your pockets
how you'd kiss me when i was in the middle of saying something
there's not a day i don't miss those rude interruptions


and i'll go
sit on the floor wearing your clothes
all that i know is i don't know
how to be something you miss


i never thought we'd have a last kiss
i never imagined we'd end like this
your name, forever the name on my lips, ooh


so i'll watch your life in pictures like i used to watch you sleep
and i feel you forget me like i used to feel you breathe
and i'll keep up with our old friends just to ask them how you are
hope it's nice where you are


and i hope the sun shines and it's a beautiful day
and something reminds you you wish you had stayed
you can plan for a change in the weather and time
but i never planned on you changing your mind


so, i'll go
sit on the floor wearing your clothes
all that i know is i don't know
how to be something you miss


i never thought we'd have a last kiss
i never imagined we'd end like this
your name, forever the name on my lips


just like our last kiss
forever the name on my lips
forever the name on my lips
just like our last

you, with your words like knives
and swords and weapons that you use against me
you have knocked me off my feet again
got me feeling like i'm nothing
you, with your voice like nails on a chalkboard
calling me out when i'm wounded
you, pickin' on the weaker man


well, you can take me down
with just one single blow
but you don't know what you don't know


someday, i'll be livin' in a big, ole city
and all you're ever gonna be is mean
someday, i'll be big enough so you can't hit me
and all you're ever gonna be is mean
why you gotta be so mean?


you, with your switching sides
and your wildfire lies and your humiliation
you have pointed out my flaws again
as if i don't already see them
i walk with my head down, trying to block you out
'cause i'll never impress you
i just wanna feel okay again


i bet you got pushed around
somebody made you cold
but the cycle ends right now
'cause you can't lead me down that road
and you don't know what you don't know


someday, i'll be livin' in a big, ole city
and all you're ever gonna be is mean
someday, i'll be big enough so you can't hit me
and all you're ever gonna be is mean
why you gotta be so mean?


and i can see you years from now in a bar
talking over a football game
with that same big, loud opinion
but nobody's listening
washed up and ranting about the same old bitter things
drunk and grumblin' on about how i can't sing
but all you are is mean


but someday, i'll be livin' in a big, ole city
and all you're ever gonna be is mean
yeah, someday, i'll be big enough so you can't hit me
and all you're ever gonna be is mean
why you gotta be so mean?
someday, i'll be livin' in a big, ole city
(why you gotta be so mean?)
and all you're ever gonna be is mean
(why you gotta be so mean?)
someday, i'll be big enough so you can't hit me
(why you gotta be so mean?)
and all you're ever gonna be is mean
why you gotta be so mean?

oh-oh, oh-oh
oh-oh, oh-oh


you were in college working part time waitin' tables
left a small town, never looked back
i was a flight risk with a fear of falling
wonderin' why we bother with love if it never lasts


i say, "can you believe it?"
as we're lyin' on the couch
the moment i could see it
yes, yes, i can see it now


do you remember, we were sittin' there by the water?
you put your arm around me for the first time
you made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter
you are the best thing that's ever been mine


flash forward and we're takin' on the world together
and there's a drawer of my things at your place
you learn my secrets and you figure out why i'm guarded
you say we'll never make my parents' mistakes


but we got bills to pay
we got nothing figured out
when it was hard to take
yes, yes, this is what i thought about


do you remember, we were sittin' there by the water?
you put your arm around me for the first time
you made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter
you are the best thing that's ever been mine
do you remember all the city lights on the water?
you saw me start to believe for the first time
you made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter
you are the best thing that's ever been mine


oh-oh, oh-oh


and i remember that fight, 2:30am
as everything was slipping right out of our hands
i ran out crying and you followed me out into the street
braced myself for the goodbye
'cause that's all i've ever known
then you took me by surprise
you said, "i'll never leave you alone"


you said, "i remember how we felt sitting by the water
and every time i look at you, it's like the first time
i fell in love with a careless man's careful daughter
she is the best thing that's ever been mine"


hold on, make it last
hold on, never turn back
(hold on) you made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter (make it last)
(hold on) you are the best thing that's ever been mine (hold on)


yes, yes, do you believe it? (hold on)
yes, yes, we're gonna make it now (hold on)
yes, yes, i can see it
yes, yes, i can see it now

your little hand's wrapped around my finger
and it's so quiet in the world tonight
your little eyelids flutter 'cause you're dreaming
so i tuck you in, turn on your favourite nightlight


to you, everything's funny
you got nothing to regret
i'd give all i have, honey
if you could stay like that


oh, darling, don't you ever grow up
don't you ever grow up, just stay this little
oh, darling, don't you ever grow up
don't you ever grow up, it could stay this simple
i won't let nobody hurt you
won't let no one break your heart
and no one will desert you
just try to never grow up


never grow up


you're in the car, on the way to the movies
and you're mortified your mom's dropping you off
at fourteen, there's just so much you can't do
and you can't wait to move out someday and call your own shots


but don't make her drop you off around the block
remember that she's gettin' older, too
and don't lose the way that you dance around
in your pjs getting ready for school


oh, darling, don't you ever grow up
don't you ever grow up, just stay this little
oh, darling, don't you ever grow up
don't you ever grow up, it could stay this simple
no one's ever burned you
nothing's ever left you scarred
and even though you want to
just try to never grow up


take pictures in your mind of your childhood room
memorize what it sounded like when your dad gets home
remember the footsteps, remember the words said
and all your little brother's favorite songs
i just realized everything i have is, someday, gonna be gone


so, here i am in my new apartment
in a big city, they just dropped me off
it's so much colder than i thought it would be
so i tuck myself in and turn my nightlight on


wish i'd never grown up
i wish i'd never grown up
oh, i don't wanna grow up
wish i'd never grown up, i could still be little
oh, i don't wanna grow up
wish i'd never grown up, it could still be simple
oh, darling, don't you ever grow up
don't you ever grow up, just stay this little
oh, darlin', don't you ever grow up
don't you ever grow up, it could stay this simple
i won't let nobody hurt you (never grow up)
won't let no one break your heart
and even though you want to
please, try to never grow up


oh, oh (never grow up)
don't you ever grow up
oh (never grow up)
just never grow up

elevator buttons and morning air
strangers' silence makes me want to take the stairs
if you were here, we'd laugh about their vacant stares
but right now, my time is theirs
seems like there's always someone who disapproves
they'll judge it like they know about me and you
and the verdict comes from those with nothing else to do
the jury's out, but my choice is you


so don't you worry your pretty little mind
people throw rocks at things that shine
and life makes love look hard
the stakes are high, the water's rough
but this love is ours


you never know what people have up their sleeves
ghosts from your past gonna jump out at me
lurking in the shadows with their lip gloss smiles
but i don't care, 'cause right now, you're mine
and you'll say


don't you worry your pretty little mind
people throw rocks at things that shine
and life makes love look hard
the stakes are high, the water's rough
but this love is ours


and it's not theirs to speculate if it's wrong and
your hands are tough, but they are where mine belong and
i'll fight their doubt and give you faith with this song for you
'cause i love the gap between your teeth
and i love the riddles that you speak
and any snide remarks from my father about your tattoos
will be ignored, 'cause my heart is yours


so don't you worry your pretty little mind
people throw rocks at things that shine
and life makes love look hard
and don't you worry your pretty little mind
people throw rocks at things that shine
but they can't take what's ours
they can't take what's ours
the stakes are high, the water's rough
but this love is ours

the way you move is like a full on rainstorm and i'm a house of cards
you're the kind of reckless that should send me runnin'
but i kinda know that i won't get far
and you stood there in front of me, just close enough to touch
close enough to hope you couldn't see what i was thinkin' of


drop everything now, meet me in the pouring rain
kiss me on the sidewalk, take away the pain
'cause i see sparks fly whenever you smile
get me with those green eyes, baby, as the lights go down
give me something that'll haunt me when you're not around
'cause i see sparks fly whenever you smile


my mind forgets to remind me you're a bad idea
you touch me once and it's really somethin'
you find i'm even better than you imagined i would be
i'm on my guard for the rest of the world
but with you, i know it's no good
and i could wait patiently, but i really wish you would


drop everything now, meet me in the pouring rain
kiss me on the sidewalk, take away the pain
'cause i see sparks fly whenever you smile
get me with those green eyes, baby, as the lights go down
give me something that'll haunt me when you're not around
'cause i see sparks fly whenever you smile


i run my fingers through your hair and watch the lights go wild
just keep on keepin' your eyes on me, it's just wrong enough to make it feel right
and lead me up the staircase, won't you whisper soft and slow?
i'm captivated by you, baby, like a firework show


drop everything now, meet me in the pouring rain
kiss me on the sidewalk (ah-ah), take away the pain
'cause i see sparks fly whenever you smile
get me with those green eyes, baby, as the lights go down
give me something that'll haunt me when you're not around
'cause i see sparks fly whenever you smile


and the sparks fly
oh, baby, smile
and the sparks fly

i am not the kind of girl
who should be rudely bargin' in on a white veil occasion
but you are not the kind of boy
who should be marrying the wrong girl
i sneak in and see your friends
and her snotty little family all dressed in pastel
and she is yelling at a bridesmaid
somewhere back inside a room
wearin' a gown shaped like a pastry


this is surely not what you thought it would be
i lose myself in a daydream
where i stand and say


don't say yes, run away now
i'll meet you when you're out
of the church, at the back door
don't wait or say a single vow
you need to hear me out
and they said, "speak now"


fond gestures are exchanged
and the organ starts to play a song that sounds like a death march
and i am hiding in the curtains
it seems that i was uninvited by your lovely bride-to-be


she floats down the aisle like a pageant queen
but i know you wish it was me
you wish it was me, don't you?


don't say yes, run away now
i'll meet you when you're out
of the church, at the back door
don't wait or say a single vow
you need to hear me out
and they said, "speak now"
don't say yes, run away now (run away now)
i'll meet you when you're out
of the church, at the back door
don't wait or say a single vow (say a single vow)
your time is running out
and they said, "speak now"


ooh (run away now), la
ooh (say a single vow), ooh


i hear the preacher say
"speak now or forever hold your peace"
there's the silence, there's my last chance
i stand up with shaky hands, all eyes on me
horrified looks from everyone in the room
but i'm only lookin' at you


i am not the kind of girl
who should be rudely bargin' in on a white veil occasion
but you are not the kind of boy
who should be marrying the wrong girl, haha


so, don't say yes, run away now
i'll meet you when you're out
of the church, at the back door
don't wait or say a single vow
you need to hear me out
they said, "speak now"
and you say, "let's run away now (run away now)
i'll meet you when i'm out
of my tux, at the back door
baby, i didn't say my vows (say a single vow)
so glad you were around
when they said, 'speak now'"

tall, dark, and superman
he puts papers in his briefcase and drives away
to save the world or go to work
it's the same thing to me
he's got his mother's eyes, his father's ambition
i wonder if he knows how much that i miss him
i hang on every word you say, yay
and you smile and say, "how are you?”
i say, "just fine"
i always forget to tell you, i love you
i love you forever


i watch superman fly away
you've got a busy day today
go save the world, i'll be around
and i watch superman fly away
come back, i'll be with you someday
i'll be right here on the ground
when you come back down


tall, dark and beautiful
he's complicated, he's irrational
but i hope someday you'll take me away and save the day, yeah
something in his deep brown eyes has me sayin'
he's not all bad like his reputation
and i can't hear one single word they say
and you'll leave, got places to be and i'll be okay
i always forget to tell you i love you
i loved you from the very first day


i watch superman fly away
you've got a busy day today
go save the world, i'll be around
i watch superman fly away
come back, i'll be with you someday
i'll be right here on the ground
when you come back down


and i watch you fly around the world
and i hope you don't save some other girl
don't forget, don't forget about me
i'm far away, but i never let you go
i'm love-struck and looking out the window
don't forget, don't forget where i'll be
right here, wishing the flowers were from you
wishing the card was from you
wishing the call was from you
'cause i loved you from the very first day


i watch superman fly away
you've got a busy day today
go save the world, i'll be around
forever and ever here
i watch superman fly away
i swear, i'll be with you someday
i'll be right here on the ground
when you come back down


la, la, la, la, la, la
la, la, la, la, la, la
when you come back down

i used to think, one day, we'd tell the story of us
how we met and the sparks flew instantly
and people would say, "they're the lucky ones"
i used to know my place was the spot next to you
now, i'm searching the room for an empty seat
'cause lately, i don't even know what page you're on


oh, a simple complication
miscommunications lead to fallout
so many things that i wish you knew
so many walls up, i can't break through


now, i'm standin' alone in a crowded room
and we're not speakin'
and i'm dyin' to know
is it killin' you like it's killin' me? yeah
i don't know what to say since the twist of fate
when it all broke down
and the story of us looks a lot like a tragedy now


next chapter


how'd we end up this way?
see me nervously pulling at my clothes and trying to look busy
and you're doin' your best to avoid me
i'm starting to think, one day, i'll tell the story of us
how i was losing my mind when i saw you here
but you held your pride like you should've held me


oh, i'm scared to see the ending
why are we pretending this is nothin'?
i'd tell you i miss you, but i don't know how
i've never heard silence quite this loud


now, i'm standin' alone in a crowded room
and we're not speakin'
and i'm dyin' to know
is it killin' you like it's killin' me? yeah
i don't know what to say since the twist of fate
when it all broke down
and the story of us looks a lot like a tragedy now


this is lookin' like a contest
of who can act like they care less
but i liked it better when you were on my side
the battle's in your hands now
but i would lay my armor down
if you said you'd rather love than fight


so many things that you wish i knew
but the story of us might be ending soon


now, i'm standin' alone in a crowded room
and we're not speakin'
and i'm dyin' to know
is it killin' you like it's killin' me? yeah
and i don't know what to say since the twist of fate
when it all broke down
and the story of us looks a lot like a tragedy now, now, now
and we're not speakin'
and i'm dyin' to know
is it killin' you like it's killin' me? yeah
i don't know what to say since the twist of fate
'cause we're going down
and the story of us looks a lot like a tragedy now


the end

today was a fairytale, you were the prince
i used to be a damsel in distress
you took me by the hand and you picked me up at six
today was a fairytale
today was a fairytale


today was a fairytale, i wore a dress
you wore a dark gray t-shirt
you told me i was pretty when i looked like a mess
today was a fairytale


time slows down
whenever you're around


well, can you feel this magic in the air?
it must have been the way you kissed me
fell in love when i saw you standing there
it must have been the way
today was a fairytale
it must have been the way
today was a fairytale


today was a fairytale, you've got a smile
that takes me to another planet
every move you make, everything you say is right
today was a fairytale
today was a fairytale, all that i can say
is now it's getting so much clearer
nothing made sense 'til the time i saw your face
today was a fairytale


time slows down
whenever you're around, yeah

it must have been the way you kissed me
fell in love when i saw you standing there
it must have been the way
today was a fairytale
it must have been the way
today was a fairytale


time slows down
whenever you're around
i can feel my heart
it's beating in my chest
did you feel it?
i can't put this down


but can you feel this magic in the air?
it must have been the way you kissed me
fell in love when i saw you standing there
it must have been the way


but can you feel this magic in the air?
it must have been the way you kissed me
fell in love when i saw you standing there
