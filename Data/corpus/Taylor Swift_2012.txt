it feels like a perfect night
to dress up like hipsters
and make fun of our exes
uh-uh, uh-uh
it feels like a perfect night
for breakfast at midnight
to fall in love with strangers
uh-uh, uh-uh


yeah
we're happy, free, confused and lonely at the same time
it's miserable and magical, oh, yeah
tonight's the night when we forget about the deadlines
it's time, oh-oh


i don't know about you
but i'm feeling twenty-two
everything will be alright if
you keep me next to you
you don't know about me
but i'll bet you want to
everything will be alright if
we just keep dancing like we're
twenty-two, twenty-two


it seems like one of those nights
this place is too crowded
too many cool kids
uh-uh, uh-uh (who's taylor swift, anyway? ew)
it seems like one of those nights
we ditch the whole scene
and end up dreamin'
instead of sleeping


yeah
we're happy, free, confused and lonely in the best way
it's miserable and magical, oh, yeah
tonight's the night when we forget about the heartbreaks
it's time, oh-oh


(hey!) i don't know about you
but i'm feeling twenty-two
everything will be alright if (ooh)
you keep me next to you
you don't know about me
but i'll bet you want to
everything will be alright if (alright)
we just keep dancing like we're
twenty-two (oh-oh-oh-oh, oh), twenty-two (i don't know about you)
twenty-two, twenty-two (ooh)


it feels like one of those nights
we ditch the whole scene
it feels like one of those nights
we won't be sleepin'
it feels like one of those nights
you look like bad news
i gotta have you
i gotta have you (you)
woah, ooh, yeah, eh-yeah


(hey!) i don't know about you (i don't know about you)
but i'm feeling twenty-two
everything will be alright if (ooh)
you keep me next to you
you don't know about me (you don't know about me)
but i'll bet you want to
everything will be alright if
we just keep dancing like we're (dancing like we're twenty-two)
twenty-two (woah-oh), twenty-two (dancing like)
twenty-two (yeah, yeah), twenty-two (yeah, yeah, yeah)


it feels like one of those nights (twenty-two)
we ditch the whole scene
it feels like one of those nights (twenty-two)
we won't be sleeping
it feels like one of those nights (twenty-two)
you look like bad news
i gotta have you
i gotta have you

i walked through the door with you, the air was cold
but something 'bout it felt like home somehow
and i left my scarf there at your sister's house
and you've still got it in your drawer, even now


oh, your sweet disposition and my wide-eyed gaze
we're singing in the car, getting lost upstate
autumn leaves falling down like pieces into place
and i can picture it after all these days


and i know it's long gone and
that magic's not here no more
and i might be okay, but i'm not fine at all
oh, oh, oh


'cause there we are again on that little town street
you almost ran the red 'cause you were lookin' over at me
wind in my hair, i was there
i remember it all too well


photo album on the counter, your cheeks were turning red
you used to be a little kid with glasses in a twin-sized bed
and your mother's telling stories 'bout you on the tee-ball team
you taught me 'bout your past, thinking your future was me


and i know it's long gone and
there was nothing else i could do
and i forget about you long enough
to forget why i needed to

'cause there we are again in the middle of the night
we're dancing ‘round the kitchen in the refrigerator light
down the stairs, i was there
i remember it all too well, yeah


well, maybe we got lost in translation
maybe i asked for too much
but maybe this thing was a masterpiece
'til you tore it all up
running scared, i was there
i remember it all too well
and you call me up again
just to break me like a promise
so casually cruel in the name of being honest
i'm a crumpled up piece of paper lying here
'cause i remember it all, all, all
too well


time won't fly, it's like i'm paralyzed by it
i'd like to be my old self again, but i'm still trying to find it
after plaid shirt days and nights when you made me your own
now, you mail back my things and i walk home alone
but you keep my old scarf from that very first week
'cause it reminds you of innocence and it smells like me
you can't get rid of it
'cause you remember it all too well, yeah


'cause there we are again when i loved you so
back before you lost the one real thing you've ever known
it was rare, i was there
i remember it all too well


wind in my hair, you were there
you remember it all
down the stairs, you were there
you remember it all
it was rare, i was there
i remember it all too well

took a deep breath in the mirror
he didn't like it when i wore high heels
but i do
turn the lock and put my headphones on
he always said he didn't get this song
but i do, i do


i walked in, expecting you'd be late
but you got here early and you stand and wave
i walk to you
you pull my chair out and help me in
and you don't know how nice that is
but i do


and you throw your head back laughin' like a little kid
i think it's strange that you think i'm funny 'cause he never did
i've been spending the last eight months
thinkin' all love ever does is break and burn and end
but on a wednesday, in a café, i watched it begin again


you said you never met one girl who
had as many james taylor records as you
but i do
we tell stories and you don't know why
i'm comin' off a little shy
but i do


but you throw your head back laughin' like a little kid
i think it's strange that you think i'm funny 'cause he never did
i've been spending the last eight months
thinkin' all love ever does is break and burn and end
but on a wednesday, in a café, i watched it begin again


and we walked down the block to my car
and i almost brought him up
but you start to talk about the movies
that your family watches every single christmas
and i wanna talk about that
and for the first time, what's past is past


'cause you throw your head back laughin' like a little kid
i think it's strange that you think i'm funny 'cause he never did
i've been spending the last eight months
thinkin' all love ever does is break and burn and end
but on a wednesday, in a café, i watched it begin again


hmm, hmm
but on a wednesday, in a café, i watched it begin again

you said it in a simple way
4 a.m. the second day
how strange that i don't know you at all
stumbled through the long goodbye
one last kiss, then catch your flight
right when i was just about to fall


i told myself, don't get attached
but in my mind, i play it back
spinning faster than the plane that took you


and this is when the feeling sinks in
i don't wanna miss you like this
come back, be here, come back, be here
i guess you're in new york today
i don't wanna need you this way
come back, be here, come back, be here


the delicate beginning rush
the feeling you can know so much
without knowing anything at all
and now that i can put this down
if i had known what i know now
i never would've played so nonchalant


taxi cabs and busy streets
that never bring you back to me
i can't help but wish you took me with you


and this is when the feeling sinks in
i don't wanna miss you like this
come back, be here, come back, be here
i guess you're in london today
and i don't wanna need you this way
come back, be here, come back, be here


this is falling in love in the cruelest way
this is falling for you when you are worlds away
in new york, be here
but you're in london, and i break down
'cause it's not fair that you're not around


this is when the feeling sinks in
i don't wanna miss you like this
come back, be here, come back, be here
i guess you're in new york today
and i don't wanna need you this way
come back, be here, come back, be here


oh-oh, oh-oh
i don't wanna miss you like this
oh-oh, oh-oh
come back, be here
come back, be here

everybody's waiting
everybody's watching
even when you're sleeping
keep your eyes open


the tricky thing is yesterday we were just children
playing soldiers, just pretending
dreaming dreams with happy endings
in backyards, winning battles with our wooden swords
but now we've stepped into a cruel world
where everybody stands and keeps score
keep your eyes open


everybody's waiting for you to break down
everybody's watching to see the fallout
even when you're sleeping, sleeping
keep your eyes open
keep your eyes open
keep your eyes open


so here you are, two steps ahead and staying on guard
every lesson forms a new scar
they never thought you'd make it this far
but turn around (turn around)
oh, they've surrounded you, it's a showdown (showdown)
and nobody comes to save you now
but you got something they don't
yeah, you got something they don't


you just gotta keep your eyes open


everybody's waiting for you to break down
everybody's watching to see the fallout
even when you're sleeping, sleeping
keep your eyes open
keep your eyes open
keep your eyes—


keep your feet ready, heartbeat steady
keep your eyes open
keep your aim locked, the night goes dark
keep your eyes open
(keep your eyes open)
(keep your eyes open)
(keep your eyes open)
(keep your eyes open)


everybody's waiting for you to break down
everybody's watching to see the fallout
even when you're sleeping, sleeping
keep your eyes open
keep your eyes open
keep your eyes open
keep your eyes open
keep your eyes open

don't look at me, you got a girl at home
and everybody knows that, everybody knows that, ah-ah
don't look at me, you got a girl at home
and everybody knows that


i don't even know her
but i feel a responsibility
to do what's upstanding and right
it's kinda like a code, yeah
and you've been getting closer and closer
and crossing so many lines


and it would be a fine proposition
if i was a stupid girl
but, honey, i am no one's exception
this, i have previously learned


so don't look at me, you got a girl at home
and everybody knows that, everybody knows that, ah-ah
don't look at me, you got a girl at home
and everybody knows that, everybody knows that
i see you turn off your phone
and now you've got me alone, and i say
don't look at me, you got a girl at home
and everybody knows that, everybody knows that


i just want to make sure
you understand perfectly
you're the kind of man who makes me sad
while she waits up
you chase down the newest thing
and take for granted what you have


and it would be a fine proposition
if i was a stupid girl
and, yeah, i might go with it
if i hadn't once been just like her


so don't look at me, you got a girl at home
and everybody knows that, everybody knows that, ah-ah
don't look at me, you got a girl at home
and everybody knows that, everybody knows that
i see you turn off your phone
and now you've got me alone, and i say
don't look at me, you got a girl at home
and everybody knows that, everybody knows that


oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh


call a cab, lose my number
you're about to lose your girl
call a cab, lose my number
let's consider this lesson learned


don't look at me, you got a girl at home
and everybody knows that, everybody knows that, ah-ah
don't look at me, you got a girl at home
and everybody knows that, everybody knows that
want to see you pick up your phone
and tell her you're coming home
don't look at me, you got a girl at home
and everybody knows that, everybody knows that


don't look at me, you got a girl at home
and everybody knows that, everybody knows that
it would be a fine proposition
if i hadn't once been just like her



once upon a time, a few mistakes ago
i was in your sights, you got me alone
you found me, you found me
you found me-e-e-e-e
i guess you didn't care and i guess i liked that
and when i fell hard, you took a step back
without me, without me
without me-e-e-e-e


and he's long gone when he's next to me
and i realize the blame is on me


'cause i knew you were trouble when you walked in
so shame on me now
flew me to places i'd never been
'til you put me down, oh
i knew you were trouble when you walked in
so shame on me now
flew me to places i'd never been
now, i'm lying on the cold, hard ground


oh, oh-oh
trouble, trouble, trouble
oh, oh-oh
trouble, trouble, trouble


no apologies, he'll never see you cry
pretends he doesn't know that he's the reason why
you're drowning, you're drowning
you're drowning-ing-ing-ing-ing
and i heard you moved on from whispers on the street
a new notch in your belt is all i'll ever be
and now, i see, now, i see
now, i see-e-e-e-e


he was long gone when he met me
and i realize the joke is on me, yeah


i knew you were trouble when you walked in (oh)
so shame on me now
flew me to places i'd never been
'til you put me down, oh
i knew you were trouble when you walked in
so shame on me now
flew me to places i'd never been (yeah)
now, i'm lying on the cold, hard ground


oh, oh-oh
trouble, trouble, trouble (yeah, trouble)
oh, oh-oh
trouble, trouble, trouble


and the saddest fear
comes creeping in
that you never loved me
or her, or anyone, or anything, yeah


i knew you were trouble when you walked in
so shame on me now
flew me to places i'd never been (never been)
'til you put me down, oh
i knew you were trouble when you walked in (knew it right there)
so shame on me now (knew it right there)
flew me to places i'd never been (ooh)
now, i'm lying on the cold, hard ground


oh, oh-oh
trouble, trouble, trouble (oh)
oh, oh-oh
trouble, trouble, trouble
i knew you were trouble when you walked in
trouble, trouble, trouble
i knew you were trouble when you walked in
trouble, trouble, trouble



loving him is like driving a new maserati down a dead-end street
faster than the wind, passionate as sin, ending so suddenly
loving him is like trying to change your mind once you're already flying through the free fall
like the colors in autumn, so bright just before they lose it all


losing him was blue like i'd never known
missing him was dark gray, all alone
forgetting him was like trying to know somebody you've never met
but loving him was red


(red, red)
(red, red)
loving him was red
(red, red)
(red, red)


touching him was like realizing all you ever wanted was right there in front of you
memorizing him was as easy as knowing all the words to your old favorite song
fighting with him was like trying to solve a crossword and realizing there's no right answer
regretting him was like wishing you never found out that love could be that strong


losing him was blue like i'd never known
missing him was dark gray, all alone (whoa)
forgetting him was like trying to know somebody you've never met
but loving him was red


(red, red)
oh, red (red, red)
burning red (red, red)
(red, red)


remembering him comes in flashbacks and echoes
tell myself it's time now, gotta let go
but moving on from him is impossible
when i still see it all in my head
in burning red
burning, it was red


oh, losing him was blue like i'd never known
missing him was dark gray, all alone (whoa)
forgetting him was like trying to know somebody you've never met
'cause loving him was red


(red, red) yeah, yeah, red (red, red)
burning red (red, red)
(red, red)


his love was like driving a new maserati down a dead-end street

i remember you bare feet, down the hallway
i remember your little laugh
race cars on the kitchen floor, plastic dinosaurs
i love you to the moon and back
i remember your blue eyes looking into mine
like we had our own secret club
i remember you dancing before bed time
then jumping on me waking me up
i can still feel you hold my hand, little man
and even the moment i knew
you fought it hard like an army guy
remember i leaned in and whispered to you


"come on, baby, with me
we're going to fly away from here
you were my best four years"


i remember the drive home
when the blind hope turned to crying and screaming, "why?"
flowers pile up in the worst way, no one knows what to say
about a beautiful boy who died
and it's about to be halloween
you could be anything you wanted, if you were still here
i remember the last day, when i kissed your face
and whispered in your ear


"come on, baby, with me
we're going to fly away from here
out of this curtained room and this hospital grey
we'll just disappear
come on, baby, with me
we're going to fly away from here
you were my best four years"


what if i'm standing in your closet trying to talk to you?
and what if i kept the hand-me-downs you won't grow into?
and what if i really thought some miracle would see us through?
what if the miracle was even getting one moment with you?


come on, baby, with me
we're going to fly away from here
come on, baby, with me
we're going to fly away from here
you were my best four years


i remember you bare feet, down the hallway
i love you to the moon and back

i said, "oh, my, what a marvelous tune"
it was the best night, never would forget how he moved
the whole place was dressed to the nines
and we were dancing, dancing
like we're made of starlight
like we're made of starlight


i met bobby on the boardwalk, summer of '45
picked me up, late one night out the window
we were 17 and crazy, running wild, wild
can't remember what song it was playing when we walked in
the night we snuck into a yacht club party
pretending to be a duchess and a prince


and i said, "oh, my, what a marvelous tune"
it was the best night, never would forget how he moved
the whole place was dressed to the nines
and we were dancing, dancing
like we're made of starlight, starlight
like we're made of starlight, starlight


he said, “look at you, worrying too much about things you can't change
you'll spend your whole life singing the blues if you keep thinking that way"
he was trying to skip rocks on the ocean, saying to me
"don't you see the starlight, starlight?
don't you dream impossible things?"


like, "oh, my, what a marvelous tune"
it was the best night, never would forget how he moved
the whole place was dressed to the nines
and we were dancing, dancing
like we're made of starlight, starlight
like we're made of starlight, starlight


ooh-ooh, he's talking crazy
ooh-ooh, dancing with me
ooh-ooh, we could get married
have ten kids and teach 'em how to dream


oh, my, what a marvelous tune
it was the best night, never would forget how he moved
the whole place was dressed to the nines
and we were dancing, dancing
like we're made of starlight, starlight
like we're made of starlight, starlight


don't you see the starlight, starlight?
don't you dream impossible things?

i'm pretty sure we almost broke up last night
i threw my phone across the room, at you
i was expecting some dramatic turn away
but you stayed
this morning, i said we should talk about it
'cause i read you should never leave a fight unresolved
that's when you came in wearing a football helmet
and said, "okay, let's talk"
and i said


stay, stay, stay
i've been loving you for quite some time, time, time
you think that it's funny when i'm mad, mad, mad
but i think that it's best if we both stay


before you, i'd only dated self-indulgent takers
who took all of their problems out on me
but you carry my groceries and now, i'm always laughing
and i love you because you have given me
no choice but to


stay, stay, stay
i've been loving you for quite some time, time, time
you think that it's funny when i'm mad, mad, mad
but i think that it's best if we both stay, stay, stay, stay


you took the time to memorize me
my fears, my hopes, and dreams
i just like hanging out with you all the time
all those times that you didn't leave, it's been occurring to me
i'd like to hang out with you for my whole life


stay, stay, stay
i've been loving you for quite some time, time, time
you think that it's funny when i'm mad, mad, mad
but i think that it's best if we both stay, stay
stay, stay, stay, stay!


stay, stay, stay
i've been loving you for quite some time, time, time
you think that it's funny when i'm mad, mad, mad
but i think that it's best if we both stay
(ha-ha-ha, it's so fun)

new to town with a made-up name
in the angel's city, chasing fortune and fame
and the camera flashes make it look like a dream
you had it figured out since you were in school
everybody loves pretty, everybody loves cool
so overnight, you look like a sixties queen


another name goes up in lights
like diamonds in the sky


and they’ll tell you now, you’re the lucky one
yeah, they’ll tell you now, you’re the lucky one
but can you tell me now, you’re the lucky one?
oh, oh, oh


now, it’s big black cars and riviera views
and your lover in the foyer doesn’t even know you
and your secrets end up splashed on the news front page
and they tell you that you’re lucky, but you’re so confused
'cause you don’t feel pretty, you just feel used
and all the young things line up to take your place


another name goes up in lights
you wonder if you’ll make it out alive


and they’ll tell you now, you’re the lucky one
yeah, they’ll tell you now, you’re the lucky one
but can you tell me now, you’re the lucky one?
oh, oh, oh


it was a few years later, i showed up here
and they still tell the legend of how you disappeared
how you took the money and your dignity and got the hell out
they say you bought a bunch of land somewhere
chose the rose garden over madison square
and it took some time, but i understand it now


'cause now, my name is up in lights
but i think you got it right


let me tell you now, you’re the lucky one
let me tell you now, you’re the lucky one
let me tell you now, you’re the lucky one, oh, oh, oh
and they’ll tell you now, you’re the lucky one
yeah, they’ll tell you now, you’re the lucky one
and they’ll tell you now, you’re the lucky one, oh, oh, oh
oh, whoa, oh, oh

you should've been there
should've burst through the door
with that "baby, i'm right here" smile
and it would've felt like
a million little shining stars had just aligned
and i would've been so happy


christmas lights glisten
i've got my eye on the door
just waiting for you to walk in
but the time is ticking
people ask me how i've been
as i comb back through my memory
how you said you'd be here
you said you'd be here


and it was like slow motion
standing there in my party dress
in red lipstick
with no one to impress
and they're all laughing
as i'm looking around the room
but there was one thing missing
and that was the moment i knew


and the hours pass by
now i just wanna be alone
but your close friends always seem to know
when there's something really wrong
so they follow me down the hall
and there in the bathroom
i try not to fall apart
and the sinking feeling starts
as i say hopelessly
"he said he'd be here"


and it was like slow motion
standing there in my party dress
in red lipstick
with no one to impress
and they're all laughing
and asking me about you
but there was one thing missing (missing)
and that was the moment i knew


what do you say
when tears are streaming down your face
in front of everyone you know?
and what do you do
when the one who means the most to you
is the one who didn't show?


and it was like slow motion
standing there in my party dress
in red lipstick
with no one to impress
and they're all standing around me, singing
"happy birthday to you"
but there was one thing missing
and that was the moment i knew
oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, i knew
oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh


you called me later
and said, "i'm sorry i didn't make it"
and i said, "i'm sorry, too"
and that was the moment i knew

i remember when we broke up the first time
saying, "this is it, i've had enough," 'cause like
we hadn't seen each other in a month
when you said you needed space (what?)
then you come around again and say
"baby, i miss you and i swear i'm gonna change, trust me"
remember how that lasted for a day?
i say, "i hate you," we break up, you call me, "i love you"


ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
we called it off again last night, but
ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
this time, i'm telling you, i'm telling you


we are never, ever, ever getting back together
we are never, ever, ever getting back together
you go talk to your friends, talk to my friends, talk to me
but we are never, ever, ever, ever getting back together
like, ever


i'm really gonna miss you picking fights
and me falling for it, screaming that i'm right
and you would hide away and find your peace of mind
with some indie record that's much cooler than mine


ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
you called me up again tonight, but
ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
this time, i'm telling you, i'm telling you


we (we) are never, ever, ever getting back together
we are never, ever, ever getting back together
you go talk to your friends, talk to my friends, talk to me (talk to me)
but we are never, ever, ever, ever getting back together


ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh (yeah)
ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh (yeah)
ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh (yeah)
oh-oh-oh


i used to think that we were forever, ever
and i used to say, "never say never"
ugh, so he calls me up and he's like, "i still love you"
and i'm like, "i just, i mean, this is exhausting, you know?
like, we are never getting back together, like, ever"


(no) we are never, ever, ever getting back together
we are never, ever, ever (ooh) getting back together
you go talk to your friends, talk to my friends, talk to me
but we are never, ever, ever, ever getting back together


we (ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh, no)
getting back together
we (ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, oh, oh)
getting back together (yeah)
you go talk to your friends, talk to my friends, talk to me (talk to me)
but we are never, ever, ever, ever getting back together
