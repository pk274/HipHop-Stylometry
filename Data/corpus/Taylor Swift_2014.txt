you stand with your hand on my waistline
it's a scene and we're out here in plain sight
i can hear them whisper as we pass by
it's a bad sign, bad sign
somethin' happens when everybody finds out
see the vultures circling, dark clouds
love's a fragile little flame, it could burn out
it could burn out


'cause they got the cages, they got the boxes and guns
they are the hunters, we are the foxes and we run


baby, i know places we won't be found
and they'll be chasing their tails tryin' to track us down
'cause i, i know places we can hide
i know places, i know places


lights flash and we'll run for the fences
let them say what they want, we won't hear it
loose lips sink ships all the damn time
not this time


just grab my hand and don't ever drop it, my love
they are the hunters, we are the foxes and we run


baby (baby), i know places we won't be found
and they'll (they'll) be (be) chasing their tails tryin' to track us down

we're all bored, we're all so tired of everything
we wait for trains that just aren't comin'
we show off our different scarlet letters
trust me, mine is better
we're so young, but we're on the road to ruin
we play dumb, but we know exactly what we're doin'
we cry tears of mascara in the bathroom
honey, life is just a classroom
ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah


'cause baby, i could build a castle
out of all the bricks they threw at me
and every day is like a battle
but every night with us is like a dream
baby, we're the new romantics, come on, come along with me
heartbreak is the national anthem, we sing it proudly
we are too busy dancin' to get knocked off our feet
baby, we're the new romantics
the best people in life are free


we're all here, the lights and noise are blinding
we hang back, it's all in the timing
it's poker, he can't see it in my face
but i'm about to play my ace, ah
we need love, but all we want is danger
we team up, then switch sides like a record changer
the rumors are terrible and cruel
but, honey, most of them are true
ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah


'cause baby, i could build a castle
out of all the bricks they threw at me
and every day is like a battle
but every night with us is like a dream

heartbreak is the national anthem, we sing it proudly
we are too busy dancin' (yeah) to get knocked off our feet (hey)

clear blue water
high tide came and brought you in
and i could go on and on, on and on and i will
skies grew darker
currents swept you out again
and you were just gone and gone, gone and gone


in silent screams and wildest dreams
i never dreamed of this


this love is good, this love is bad
this love is alive back from the dead, oh-oh, oh
these hands had to let it go free, and
this love came back to me, oh-oh, oh
oh-oh, oh-oh, oh


tossing, turning
struggled through the night with someone new
baby, i could go on and on, on and on
lantern, burning
flickered in my mind, only you

been losing grip on sinking ships
you showed up just in time


this love is good, this love is bad
this love is alive back from the dead, oh-oh, oh
these hands had to let it go free, and
this love came back to me, oh-oh, oh
this love left a permanent mark
this love is glowing in the dark, oh-oh, oh
these hands had to let it go free, and
this love came back to me, oh-oh, oh


(this love, this love, this love, this love, oh-oh, oh)
(this love, this love, this love, this love, oh-oh, oh)
(this love, this love, this love, this love, oh-oh, oh)
(this love, this love, this love, this love)


your kiss, my cheek, i watched you leave
your smile, my ghost, i fell to my knees
when you're young, you just run
but you come back to what you need


this love is good, this love is bad
this love is alive back from the dead, oh-oh, oh
these hands had to let it go free, and
this love came back to me, oh-oh, oh
(this love) this love left a permanent mark
(this love) this love is glowing in the dark, oh-oh, oh
(this love) these hands had to let it go free, and
(this love) this love came back to me, oh-oh, oh


(this love, this love, this love, this love, oh-oh, oh)
(this love, this love, this love, this love, oh-oh, oh)
(this love, this love, this love, this love)
this love, this love came back to me, oh-oh, oh

walkin' through a crowd, the village is aglow
kaleidoscope of loud heartbeats under coats
everybody here wanted somethin' more
searchin' for a sound we hadn't heard before
and it said


welcome to new york, it's been waitin' for you
welcome to new york, welcome to new york
welcome to new york, it's been waitin' for you
welcome to new york, welcome to new york
it's a new soundtrack, i could dance to this beat, beat forevermore
the lights are so bright, but they never blind me, me
welcome to new york, it's been waitin' for you
welcome to new york, welcome to new york


when we first dropped our bags on apartment floors
took our broken hearts, put them in a drawer
everybody here was someone else before
and you can want who you want
boys and boys and girls and girls


welcome to new york, it's been waitin' for you
welcome to new york, welcome to new york
welcome to new york, it's been waitin' for you
welcome to new york, welcome to new york
it's a new soundtrack, i could dance to this beat, beat forevermore
the lights are so bright, but they never blind me, me
welcome to new york (new york), it's been waitin' for you
welcome to new york, welcome to new york


like any great love, it keeps you guessing
like any real love, it's ever-changing
like any true love, it drives you crazy
but you know you wouldn't change anything, anything, anything


welcome to new york, it's been waitin' for you
welcome to new york, welcome to new york
welcome to new york, it's been waitin' for you
welcome to new york, welcome to new york
it's a new soundtrack, i could dance to this beat
the lights are so bright, but they never blind me
welcome to new york (new soundtrack), it's been waitin' for you
welcome to new york, the lights are so bright, but they never blind me
welcome to new york, so bright, they never blind me, yeah
welcome to new york, welcome to new york

he said, "let's get out of this town
drive out of the city, away from the crowds"
i thought, "heaven can't help me now"
nothing lasts forever
but this is gonna take me down


he's so tall and handsome as hell
he's so bad, but he does it so well
i can see the end as it begins
my one condition is


say you'll remember me
standin' in a nice dress
starin' at the sunset, babe
red lips and rosy cheeks
say you'll see me again
even if it's just in your
wildest dreams, ah, ha
wildest dreams, ah, ha


i said, "no one has to know what we do"
his hands are in my hair, his clothes are in my room
and his voice is a familiar sound
nothin' lasts forever
but this is gettin' good now


he's so tall and handsome as hell
he's so bad, but he does it so well
and when we've had our very last kiss
my last request is


say you'll remember me
standin' in a nice dress
starin' at the sunset, babe
red lips and rosy cheeks
say you'll see me again
even if it's just in your
wildest dreams, ah, ha
wildest dreams, ah, ha

you'll see me in hindsight
tangled up with you all night
burnin' it down
someday, when you leave me
i bet these memories
follow you around
you'll see me in hindsight
tangled up with you all night
burnin' (burnin') it (it) down (down)
someday, when you leave me
i bet these memories
follow (follow) you (you) around
(follow you around)


say you'll remember me
standin' in a nice dress
starin' at the sunset, babe
red lips and rosy cheeks
say you'll see me again
even if it's just in your (just pretend, just pretend)
wildest dreams, ah, ha (ah)
in your wildest dreams, ah, ha
even if it's just in your
in your wildest dreams, ah, ha
in your wildest dreams, ah, ha

flashing lights
and we took a wrong turn
and we fell down a rabbit hole
you held on tight to me
'cause nothing's as it seems
and spinning out of control

didn't they tell us "don't rush into things"?
didn't you flash your green eyes at me?
haven't you heard what becomes of curious minds?
ooh, didn't it all seem new and exciting?
i felt your arms twistin' around me
i should have slept with one eye open at night


we found wonderland, you and i got lost in it
and we pretended it could last forever (eh, eh)
we found wonderland, you and i got lost in it
and life was never worse, but never better (eh, eh)


(eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh)
in wonderland
(eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh)
in wonderland
(eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh)
in wonderland
(eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh)
in wonderland


so, we went on our way
too in love to think straight
all alone, or so it seemed
but there were strangers watchin'
and whispers turned to talkin'
and talking turned to screams, oh


didn't they tell us "don't rush into things"?
didn't you flash your green eyes at me?
didn't you calm my fears with a cheshire cat smile?
ooh, didn't it all seem new and exciting?
i felt your arms twistin' around me
it's all fun and games 'til somebody loses their mind
but darling


we found wonderland, you and i got lost in it
and we pretended it could last forever (eh, eh)
we found wonderland, you and i got lost in it
and life was never worse but never better (eh, eh)


(eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh)
in wonderland
(eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh) eh, eh
in wonderland
(eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh)
in wonderland
(eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh) woah
in wonderland


i reached for you, but you were gone
i knew i had to go back home
you searched the world for somethin' else
to make you feel like what we had
and in the end, in wonderland, we both went mad
oh


we found wonderland, you and i got lost in it
and we pretended it could last forever (last forever; eh, eh)
we found wonderland, you and i got lost in it (got lost in it)
and life was never worse but never better (never better; eh, eh)
(eh, eh, eh, eh, eh)
we found wonderland, you and i got lost in it
(eh, eh, eh, eh, eh)
and we pretended it could last forever (in wonderland)
(eh, eh, eh, eh, eh)
we found wonderland, you and i got lost in it (lost in it)
(eh, eh, eh, eh, eh)
and life was never worse but never better
in wonderland

one look, dark room, meant just for you
time moved too fast, you play it back
buttons on a coat, lighthearted joke
no proof, not much, but you saw enough
small talk, he drives, coffee at midnight
the light reflects the chain on your neck
he says, "look up" and your shoulders brush
no proof, one touch, but you felt enough


you can hear it in the silence (silence), silence (silence), you
you can feel it on the way home (way home), way home (way home), you
you can see it with the lights out (lights out), lights out (lights out)
you are in love, true love
you are in love


morning, his place, burnt toast, sunday
you keep his shirt, he keeps his word
and for once, you let go of your fears and your ghosts
one step, not much, but it said enough
you kiss on sidewalks, you fight and you talk
one night, he wakes, strange look on his face
pauses, then says "you're my best friend"
and you knew what it was, he is in love


you can hear it in the silence (silence), silence (silence), you
you can feel it on the way home (way home), way home (way home), you
you can see it with the lights out (lights out), lights out (lights out)
you are in love, true love


and so it goes
you two are dancing in a snow globe, 'round and 'round
and he keeps a picture of you in his office downtown
and you understand now
why they lost their minds and fought the wars
and why i've spent my whole life trying to put it into words


you can hear it in the silence (silence), silence (silence), you
you can feel it on the way home (way home), way home (way home), you
you can see it with the lights out (lights out), lights out (lights out)
you are in love, true love
you are in love (ah)
you can hear it in the silence (silence), silence (silence), you (ah)
you can feel it on the way home (way home), way home (way home), you (ah)
you can see it with the lights out (lights out), lights out (lights out)
you are in love, true love
you are in love
