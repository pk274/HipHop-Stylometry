my castle crumbled overnight
i brought a knife to a gunfight
they took the crown, but it's alright
all the liars are calling me one
nobody's heard from me for months
i'm doin' better than i ever was

high above the whole scene
loves me like i'm brand new
so call it what you want, yeah

windows boarded up after the storm
he built a fire just to keep me warm
all the drama queens taking swings
all the jokers dressing up as kings
they fade to nothing when i look at him


and i know i make the same mistakes every time
bridges burn, i never learn
at least i did one thing right
i did one thing right
i'm laughing with my lover, makin' forts under covers
trust him like a brother
yeah, you know i did one thing right
starry eyes sparkin' up my darkest night


my baby's fit like a daydream
walkin' with his head down
i'm the one he's walking to
so call it what you want, yeah

(call it what you want, call it what you want, call it)
so call it what you want, yeah

i want to wear his initial on a chain 'round my neck
chain 'round my neck
not because he owns me
but 'cause he really knows me
which is more than they can say, i
i recall late november
holding my breath, slowly, i said
"you don't need to save me
but would you run away with me?"
yes (would you run away?)


my baby's fit like a daydream
walkin' with his head down
i'm the one he's walking to

deep blue, but you painted me golden
oh, and you held me close

i could've spent forever with your hands in my pockets
picture of your face in an invisible locket
you said there was nothin' in the world that could stop it
i had a bad feelin'
and darlin', you had turned my bed into a sacred oasis
people started talkin', puttin' us through our paces
i knew there was no one in the world who could take it

deep fears that the world would divide us
so, baby, can we dance
oh, through an avalanche? and
say, say that we got it
i'm a mess, but i'm the mess that you wanted
oh, 'cause it's gravity

our secret moments in a crowded room
they got no idea about me and you
there is an indentation in the shape of you
made your mark on me, a golden tattoo


all of this silence and patience, pining and anticipation
my hands are shakin' from holdin’ back from you, ha, ah, ah
all of this silence and patience, pining and desperately waitin'
my hands are shakin' from all this, ah, ha, ha, ha-ah


say my name and everything just stops
i don’t want you like a best friend
only bought this dress so you could take it off
take it off, ha, ha, ha-ah
carve your name into my bedpost
'cause i don't want you like a best friend
only bought this dress so you could take it off
take it off, ha, ha, ha-ah


inescapable, i'm not even gonna try
and if i get burned, at least we were electrified
i'm spillin' wine in the bathtub
you kiss my face and we're both drunk
everyone thinks that they know us
but they know nothin' about


all of this silence and patience, pining and anticipation
my hands are shakin’ from holdin’ back from you, ha, ah, ah
all of this silence and patience, pining and desperately waitin'
my hands are shakin’ from all this, ah, ha, ha, ha-ah


say my name and everything just stops

only bought this dress so you could take it off
take it off, ha, ha


ha-ah-ah, ha-ah-ah, ha-ah-ah-ah
only bought this dress so you could take it off
ha-ah-ah, ha-ah-ah, ha-ah-ah-ah
only bought this dress so you could take it off


flashback when you met me
your buzzcut and my hair bleached
even in my worst times
you could see the best in me
flashback to my mistakes
my rebounds, my earthquakes
even in my worst lies
you saw the truth in me
and i woke up just in time
now i wake up by your side
my one and only, my lifeline
i woke up just in time
now i wake up by your side
my hands shake, i can’t explain this, ah, ha, ha, ha-ah


say my name and everything just stops
i don't want you like a best friend
only bought this dress so you could take it off
take it off, ha, ha, ha-ah
carve your name into my bedpost
'cause i don't want you like a best friend
only bought this dress so you could take it off
take it off, ha, ha, ha-ah


there is an indentation in the shape of you
(only bought this dress so you could take it off)
you made your mark on me, golden tattoo
(only bought this dress so you could take it off)

no, nothin' good starts in a getaway car


it was the best of times, the worst of crimes
i struck a match and blew your mind
but i didn’t mean it and you didn't see it
the ties were black, the lies were white
in shades of gray in candlelight
i wanted to leave him, i needed a reason


"x" marks the spot where we fell apart
he poisoned the well, i was lyin' to myself
i knew it from the first old fashioned, we were cursed
we never had a shotgun shot in the dark (oh)

it was the great escape, the prison break
the light of freedom on my face
but you weren’t thinkin’ and i was just drinkin'
while he was runnin’ after us, i was screamin', "go, go, go"
but with three of us, honey, it's a sideshow
and a circus ain't a love story and now we’re both sorry (we're both sorry)

there's glitter on the floor after the party
girls carryin’ their shoes down in the lobby
candle wax and polaroids on the hardwood floor
you and me from the night before, but

but i stay when you're lost and i’m scared and you're turnin' away
i want your midnights
but i'll be cleanin' up bottles with you on new year's day


you squeeze my hand three times in the back of the taxi
i can tell that it's gonna be a long road
i'll be there if you’re the toast of the town, babe
or if you strike out and you’re crawlin' home


don’t read the last page
but i stay when it's hard or it's wrong or we're makin’ mistakes

whose laugh i could recognize anywhere

but if he's a ghost, then i can be a phantom

but if i'm a thief, then he can join the heist and
we'll move to an island and

cut me into pieces
gold cage, hostage to my feelings
back against the wall
trippin', trip-trippin' when you're gone


'cause we break down a little
but when you get me alone, it's so simple
'cause, baby, i know what you know
we can feel it


and all the pieces fall right into place
gettin' caught up in a moment, lipstick on your face
so it goes
i'm yours to keep and i'm yours to lose
you know i'm not a bad girl, but i do bad things with you
so it goes


met you in a bar
all eyes on me, your illusionist
all eyes on us
i make all your gray days clear and
wear you like a necklace
i'm so chill, but you make me jealous
but i got your heart
skippin', skip-skippin' when i'm gone


'cause we break down a little
but when i get you alone, it's so simple

we can feel it

all at once, this is enough


and all at once, you are the one i have been waiting for
king of my heart, body, and soul, ooh whoathe next day

it was so nice throwin' big parties
jump into the pool from the balcony
everyone swimmin' in a champagne sea
and there are no rules when you show up here
bass beat rattling the chandelier
feelin' so gatsby for that whole year


so why'd you have to rain on my parade?
i'm shaking my head and locking the gates

this is why we can't have nice things, darlin'
because you break them, i had to take them away
this is why we can't have nice things, honey (oh)
did you think i wouldn't hear all the things you said about me?
this is why we can't have nice things


it was so nice being friends again
there i was, giving you a second chance
but you stabbed me in the back while shakin' my hand
and therein lies the issue, friends don't try to trick you
get you on the phone and mind-twist you
and so i took an axe to a mended fence


but i'm not the only friend you've lost lately (mm-mm)
if only you weren't so shady

this is why we can't have nice things, darlin' (yeah)

and here's to my baby
he ain't readin' what they call me lately
and here's to my mama
had to listen to all this drama
and here's to you
'cause forgiveness is a nice thing to do
haha, i can't even say it with a straight face (this is why we can't have)

this is why we can't have nice things, darlin' (darlin')
because you break them, i had to take them away (away)
this is why we can't have nice (uh, uh) things (oh, no), honey (baby, oh)
did you think i wouldn't hear all the things you said about me?
this is why we can't have (oh) nice (oh, no) things, darlin'
