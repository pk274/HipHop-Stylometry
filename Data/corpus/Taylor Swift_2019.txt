i blew things out of proportion, now you're blue
put you in jail for something you didn’t do
i pinned your hands behind your back, oh
thought i had reason to attack, but no


fighting with a true love is boxing with no gloves
chemistry 'til it blows up, 'til there’s no us
why'd i have to break what i love so much?
it's on your face, and i'm to blame, i need to say


hey, it's all me, in my head
i'm the one who burned us down
but it's not what i meant
sorry that i hurt you
i don't wanna do, i don’t wanna do this to you (ooh)
i don’t wanna lose, i don't wanna lose this with you (ooh)
i need to say, hey, it’s all me, just don't go
meet me in the afterglow


it's so excruciating to see you low
just wanna lift you up and not let you go
this ultraviolet morning light below
tells me this love is worth the fight, oh


i lived like an island, punished you with silence
went off like sirens, just crying
why'd i have to break what i love so much?
it’s on your face, don't walk away, i need to say


hey, it's all me, in my head
i'm the one who burned us down
but it's not what i meant
i'm sorry that i hurt you
i don't wanna do, i don't wanna do this to you (ooh)
i don't wanna lose, i don't wanna lose this with you (ooh)
i need to say, hey, it's all me, just don't go
meet me in the afterglow


tell me that you're still mine
tell me that we'll be just fine
even when i lose my mind
i need to say
tell me that it's not my fault
tell me that i'm all you want
even when i break your heart
i need to say


hey, it's all me, in my head
i'm the one who burned us down
but it's not what i meant
sorry that i hurt you
i don't wanna do, i don't wanna do this to you (ooh)
i don't wanna lose, i don't wanna lose this with you (ooh)
i need to say, hey, it's all me, just don't go
meet me in the afterglow

follow me home if you dare to
i wouldn't know where to lead you
should i take chances when no one took chances on me?
so i watch from the dark, wait for my life to start
with no beauty in my memory


all that i wanted was to be wanted
too young to wander london streets, alone and haunted
born into nothing
at least you have something, something to cling to
visions of dazzling rooms i'll never get let into
and the memories were lost long ago
but at least you have beautiful ghosts


perilous night, their voices calling
a flicker of light before the dawning
out here, the wild ones are taming the fear within me
scared to call them my friends and be broken again
is this hope just a mystical dream?


all that i wanted was to be wanted
too young to wander london streets, alone and haunted
born into nothing
at least you have something, something to cling to
visions of dazzling rooms i'll never get let into
and the memories were lost long ago
but at least you have beautiful ghosts


and so maybe my home isn't what i had known
what i thought it would be
but i feel so alive with these phantoms of night
and i know that this life isn't safe, but it's wild and it's free


all that i wanted was to be wanted
i'll never wander london streets, alone and haunted
born into nothing
with them, i have something, something to cling to
i never knew i'd love this world they've let me into
and the memories were lost long ago
so i'll dance with these beautiful ghosts
and the memories were lost long ago
so i'll dance with these beautiful ghosts

my winter nights are taken up by static
stress and holiday shopping traffic
but i close my eyes and i'm somewhere else
just like magic


in my heart is a christmas tree farm
where the people would come
to dance under sparkling lights
bundled up in their mittens and coats
and the cider would flow
and i just wanna be there tonight


sweet dreams of holly and ribbon
mistakes are forgiven
and everythin' is icy and blue
and you would be there too


under the mistletoe
watchin' the fire glow
and tellin' me, "i love you"
just bein' in your arms
takes me back to that little farm
where every wish comes true


in my heart is a christmas tree farm
there's a light in the barn
we run inside out from the cold
in the town, kids are dreamin' of sleighs
and they're warm and they're safe
they wake to see a blanket of snow


sweet dreams of holly and ribbon
mistakes are forgiven
and everythin' is icy and blue
and you would be there too


under the mistletoe
watchin' the fire glow
and tellin' me, "i love you"
just bein' in your arms
takes me back to that little farm
where every wish comes true
baby, yeah


and when i'm feelin' alone
you remind me of home
oh, baby, baby, merry christmas
and when the world isn't fair
i pretend that we're there
baby, baby, merry christmas (to you)


under the mistletoe (to you)
watching the fire glow
and tellin' me, "i love you"


oh, baby, baby, merry christmas
oh, baby, baby, merry christmas (darling)
oh, baby, baby, merry christmas
i love you
oh, baby, baby, merry christmas
oh, baby, baby, merry christmas (i just want you to know)
oh, baby, baby, merry christmas
where every wish comes true
i love you

we were in the backseat
drunk on something stronger than the drinks in the bar
"i rent a place on cornelia street"
i say casually in the car
we were a fresh page on the desk
filling in the blanks as we go
as if the street lights pointed in an arrow head
leading us home


and i hope i never lose you, hope it never ends
i'd never walk cornelia street again
that's the kinda heartbreak time could never mend
i'd never walk cornelia street again
and baby, i get mystified by how this city screams your name
and baby, i'm so terrified of if you ever walk away
i'd never walk cornelia street again
i'd never walk cornelia street again


windows flung right open, autumn air
jacket 'round my shoulders is yours
we bless the rains on cornelia street
memorize the creaks in the floor
back when we were card sharks, playing games
i thought you were leading me on
i packed my bags, left cornelia street
before you even knew i was gone


but then you called, showed your hand
i turned around before i hit the tunnel
sat on the roof, you and i


i hope i never lose you, hope it never ends
i'd never walk cornelia street again
that's the kinda heartbreak time could never mend
i'd never walk cornelia street again
and baby, i get mystified by how this city screams your name (city screams your name)
and baby, i'm so terrified of if you ever walk away
i'd never walk cornelia street again
i'd never walk cornelia street again

you hold my hand on the street
walk me back to that apartment
years ago, we were just inside
barefoot in the kitchen
sacred new beginnings
that became my religion, listen


i hope i never lose you
i'd never walk cornelia street again
oh, never again
and baby, i get mystified by how this city screams your name (city screams your name)
and baby, i'm so terrified of if you ever walk away
i'd never walk cornelia street again
i'd never walk cornelia street again


i don't wanna lose you (hope it never ends)
i'd never walk cornelia street again
i don't wanna lose you (yeah)


"i rent a place on cornelia street"
i say casually in the car

(yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)


fever dream high in the quiet of the night
you know that i caught it (oh yeah, you're right, i want it)
bad, bad boy, shiny toy with a price
you know that i bought it (oh yeah, you're right, i want it)


killing me slow, out the window
i'm always waiting for you to be waiting below
devils roll the dice, angels roll their eyes
what doesn't kill me makes me want you more


and it's new, the shape of your body
it's blue, the feeling i've got
and it's ooh, woah-oh
it's a cruel summer
it's cool, that's what i tell 'em
no rules in breakable heaven
but ooh, woah-oh
it's a cruel summer with you


hang your head low in the glow of the vending machine
i'm not dying (oh yeah, you're right, i want it)
we say that we'll just screw it up in these trying times
we're not trying (oh yeah, you're right, i want it)


so cut the headlights, summer's a knife
i'm always waiting for you just to cut to the bone
devils roll the dice, angels roll their eyes
and if i bleed, you'll be the last to know, oh


it's new, the shape of your body
it's blue, the feeling i've got
and it's ooh, woah-oh
it's a cruel summer
it's cool, that's what i tell 'em
no rules in breakable heaven
but ooh, woah-oh
it's a cruel summer with you


i'm drunk in the back of the car
and i cried like a baby comin' home from the bar (oh)
said, "i'm fine," but it wasn't true
i don't wanna keep secrets just to keep you
and i snuck in through the garden gate
every night that summer just to seal my fate (oh)
and i scream, "for whatever it's worth
i love you, ain't that the worst thing you ever heard?"
he looks up, grinnin' like a devil


it's new, the shape of your body
it's blue, the feeling i've got
and it's ooh, woah-oh
it's a cruel summer
it's cool, that's what i tell 'em
no rules in breakable heaven
but ooh, woah-oh
it's a cruel summer with you


i'm drunk in the back of the car
and i cried like a baby comin' home from the bar (oh)
said, "i'm fine," but it wasn't true
i don't wanna keep secrets just to keep you
and i snuck in through the garden gate
every night that summer just to seal my fate (oh)
and i scream, "for whatever it's worth
i love you, ain't that the worst thing you ever heard?"
(yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)

my love was as cruel as the cities i lived in
everyone looked worse in the light
there are so many lines that i've crossed unforgiven
i'll tell you the truth but never goodbye


i don't wanna look at anything else now that i saw you
i don't wanna think of anything else now that i thought of you
i've been sleepin' so long in a twenty-year dark night
and now i see daylight, i only see daylight


luck of the draw only draws the unlucky
and so i became the butt of the joke
i wounded the good and i trusted the wicked
clearin' the air, i breathed in the smoke


maybe you ran with the wolves and refused to settle down
maybe i've stormed out of every single room in this town
threw out our cloaks and our daggers because it's morning now
it's brighter now, now


i don't wanna look at anything else now that i saw you
(i can never look away)
i don't wanna think of anything else now that i thought of you
(things will never be the same)
i've been sleepin' so long in a twenty-year dark night
(now i'm wide awake)
and now i see daylight (daylight), i only see daylight (daylight)


i only see daylight, daylight, daylight, daylight
i only see daylight, daylight, daylight, daylight


and i can still see it all (in my mind)
all of you, all of me (intertwined)
i once believed love would be (black and white)
but it's golden (golden)
and i can still see it all (in my head)
back and forth from new york (sneakin' in your bed)
i once believed love would be (burnin' red)
but it's golden
like daylight, like daylight
like daylight, daylight


i don't wanna look at anything else now that i saw you
(i can never look away)
and i don't wanna think of anything else now that i thought of you
(things will never be the same)
i've been sleepin' so long in a twenty-year dark night
(now i'm wide awake)
and now i see daylight (i see daylight), i only see daylight (ah)


i only see daylight, daylight, daylight, daylight
i only see daylight, daylight, daylight, daylight (ah)
(and i can still see it all)
i only see daylight, daylight, daylight, daylight
(and i can still see it all, back and forth from new york)
i only see daylight, daylight, daylight, daylight
(i once believed love would be burning red)


like daylight
it's golden like daylight
you gotta step into the daylight and let it go
just let it go, let it go

i wanna be defined by the things that i love
not the things i hate
not the things i'm afraid of, i'm afraid of
or the things that haunt me in the middle of the night
i, i just think that
you are what you love

my, my, my, my
my, my, my, my
my, my, my, my
my, my, my, my
my, my, my, my
my, my, my, my
my, my, my, my
my, my, my, my


saying goodbye is death by a thousand cuts
flashbacks waking me up
i get drunk, but it's not enough
’cause the morning comes and you're not my baby
i look through the windows of this love
even though we boarded them up
chandelier's still flickering here
’cause i can't pretend it's okay when it's not
it's death by a thousand cuts


i dress to kill my time, i take the long way home
i ask the traffic lights if it'll be alright
they say, "i don't know"
and what once was ours is no one's now
i see you everywhere, the only thing we share
is this small town
you said it was a great love, one for the ages
but if the story’s over, why am i still writing pages?


’cause saying goodbye is death by a thousand cuts
flashbacks waking me up
i get drunk, but it's not enough
’cause the morning comes and you're not my baby
i look through the windows of this love
even though we boarded them up
chandelier's still flickering here
'cause i can’t pretend it's okay when it's not
it's death by a thousand cuts


my heart, my hips, my body, my love
tryna find a part of me that you didn't touch
gave up on me like i was a bad drug
now i'm searching for signs in a haunted club
our songs, our films, united we stand
our country, guess it was a lawless land
quiet my fears with the touch of your hand
paper cut stings from our paper-thin plans
my time, my wine, my spirit, my trust
tryna find a part of me you didn't take up
gave you too much, but it wasn't enough
but i'll be alright, it's just a thousand cuts


i get drunk, but it's not enough
'cause you're not my baby
i look through the windows of this love
even though we boarded them up
chandelier's still flickering here
'cause i can't pretend it's okay when it's not
no, it's not
it's death by a thousand cuts (you didn't touch)


tryna find a part of me that you didn't touch
my body, my love, my trust (it's death by a thousand cuts)
but it wasn't enough, it wasn't enough, no, no


i take the long way home
i ask the traffic lights if it'll be alright
they say, "i don't know"

we were crazy to think
crazy to think that this could work
remember how i said i'd die for you?
we were stupid to jump
in the ocean separating us
remember how i’d fly to you?


and i can't talk to you when you're like this
staring out the window like i’m not your favorite town
i'm new york city
i still do it for you, babe
they all warned us about times like this
they say the road gets hard and you get lost
when you're led by blind faith, blind faith


but we might just get away with it
religion's in your lips
even if it's a false god
we'd still worship
we might just get away with it
the altar is my hips
even if it's a false god
we'd still worship this love
we’d still worship this love
we’d still worship this love


i know heaven's a thing
i go there when you touch me, honey
hell is when i fight with you
but we can patch it up good
make confessions and we’re begging for forgiveness
got the wine for you


and you can't talk to me when i'm like this
daring you to leave me just so i can try and scare you
you're the west village
you still do it for me, babe
they all warned us about times like this
they say the road gets hard and you get lost
when you’re led by blind faith, blind faith


but we might just get away with it
religion's in your lips
even if it's a false god
we'd still worship
we might just get away with it
the altar is my hips
even if it's a false god
we'd still worship this love
we'd still worship this love

even if it's a false god
even if it's a false god
still worship this love

how many days did i spend thinking
'bout how you did me wrong, wrong, wrong?
lived in the shade you were throwing
'til all of my sunshine was gone, gone, gone
and i couldn't get away from ya
in my feelings more than drake, so yeah
your name on my lips, tongue-tied
free rent, living in my mind


but then something happened one magical night


i forgot that you existed
and i thought that it would kill me, but it didn't
and it was so nice
so peaceful and quiet
i forgot that you existed
it isn't love, it isn't hate, it's just indifference
i forgot that you


got out some popcorn
as soon as my rep started going down, down, down
laughed on the school yard
as soon as i tripped up and hit the ground, ground, ground
and i would've stuck around for ya
would've fought the whole town, so yeah
would've been right there, front row
even if nobody came to your show


but you showed who you are, then one magical night


i forgot that you existed
and i thought that it would kill me, but it didn't
and it was so nice
so peaceful and quiet
i forgot that you existed
it isn't love, it isn't hate, it's just indifference
i forgot that you


sent me a clear message
taught me some hard lessons
i just forget what they were
it's all just a blur


i forgot that you existed
and i thought that it would kill me, but it didn't
and it was so nice
so peaceful and quiet
i forgot that you existed
i did, i did, i did
it isn't hate, it's just indifference
it isn't love, it isn't hate, it's just indifference
so, yeah

macavity's a mystery cat, he's called the hiddenpaw
for he's the master criminal who can defy the law
he's the bafflement of scotland yard, the flying squad's despair
for when they reach the scene of crime, macavity's not there


macavity, macavity, there's no one like macavity
he's broken every human law, he breaks the law of gravity
his powers of levitation would make a fakir stare
but when they reach the scene of crime, macavity's not there


macavity's a ginger cat, he's very tall and thin
you would know him if you saw him for his eyes are sunken in
his brow is deeply lined with thought, his head is highly domed
his coat is dusty from neglect, his whiskers are uncombed
he sways his head from side to side, with movements like a snake
and when you think he's half asleep, he's always wide awake


macavity, macavity, there's no one like macavity
for he's a fiend in feline shape, a monster of depravity
you may meet him in a by-street, you may see him in the square
but when a crime's discovered, then macavity's not there


he's outwardly respectable, i know, he cheats at cards
and his footprints are not found in any files of scotland yard's
and when the larder's looted and the jewel case is rifled
or when the milk is missing or another peke's been stifled
or the greenhouse glass is broken and the trellis past repair
there's the wonder of the thing, macavity's not there


macavity, macavity, there's no one like macavity
there never was a cat of such deceitfulness and suavity
he always has an alibi, and one or two to spare
what ever time the deed took place, macavity wasn't there
and they say that all the cats whose wicked deeds are widely known
i might mention mungojerrie, rumpleteazer, griddlebone
are nothing more than agents for the cat who all the time
just controls the operations, the napoleon of crime
macavity, macavity, there's no one like macavity
he's a fiend in feline shape, a monster of depravity
you may meet him in a by-street, you may see him in the square
but when a crime's discovered, then macavity, macavity
macavity, macavity


when a crime's discovered, then
macavity's not there

i promise that you'll never find another like me


i know that i'm a handful, baby, uh
i know i never think before i jump
and you're the kinda guy the ladies want
(and there's a lotta cool chicks out there)
i know that i went psycho on the phone
i never leave well enough alone
and trouble's gonna follow where i go
(and there's a lotta cool chicks out there)


but one of these things is not like the others
like a rainbow with all of the colors
baby doll, when it comes to a lover
i promise that you'll never find another like


me-e-e, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
i'm the only one of me
baby, that's the fun of me
eeh-eeh-eeh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
you're the only one of you
baby, that's the fun of you
and i promise that nobody's gonna love you like me-e-e


i know i tend to make it about me
i know you never get just what you see
but i will never bore you, baby
(and there's a lotta lame guys out there)
and when we had that fight out in the rain
you ran after me and called my name
i never wanna see you walk away
(and there's a lotta lame guys out there)


girl, there ain't no "i" in "team"
but you know there is a "me"
strike the band up, one, two, three
i promise that you'll never find another like me
girl, there ain't no "i" in "team"
but you know there is a "me"
and you can't spell "awesome" without "me"
i promise that you'll never find another like


me-e-e (yeah), ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh (and i want ya, baby)
i'm the only one of me (i'm the only one of me)
baby, that's the fun of me (baby, that's the fun of me)
eeh-eeh-eeh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh (oh)
you're the only one of you (oh)
baby, that's the fun of you
and i promise that nobody's gonna love you like me-e-e


girl, there ain't no "i" in "team" (ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
but you know there is a "me"
i'm the only one of me (oh-oh)
baby, that's the fun of me
(eeh-eeh-eeh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
strike the band up, one, two, three
you can't spell "awesome" without "me"
you're the only one of you (yeah, yeah)
baby, that's the fun of you
and i promise that nobody's gonna love you like me-e-e

you know i adore you, i'm crazier for you
than i was at sixteen, lost in a film scene
waving homecoming queens, marching band playing
i'm lost in the lights
american glory faded before me
now i'm feeling hopeless, ripped up my prom dress
running through rose thorns, i saw the scoreboard
and ran for my life (ah)


no cameras catch my pageant smile
i counted days, i counted miles
to see you there, to see you there
it's been a long time coming, but


it's you and me, that's my whole world
they whisper in the hallway, "she's a bad, bad girl" (okay)
the whole school is rolling fake dice
you play stupid games, you win stupid prizes
it's you and me, there's nothing like this
miss americana and the heartbreak prince (okay)
we're so sad, we paint the town blue
voted most likely to run away with you


my team is losing, battered and bruising
i see the high fives between the bad guys
leave with my head hung, you are the only one
who seems to care
american stories burning before me
i'm feeling helpless, the damsels are depressed
boys will be boys then, where are the wise men?
darling, i'm scared (ah)


no cameras catch my muffled cries
i counted days, i counted miles
to see you there, to see you there
and now the storm is coming, but


it's you and me, that's my whole world
they whisper in the hallway, "she's a bad, bad girl" (okay)
the whole school is rolling fake dice
you play stupid games, you win stupid prizes
it's you and me, there's nothing like this
miss americana and the heartbreak prince (okay)
we're so sad, we paint the town blue
voted most likely to run away with you


and i don't want you to (go), i don't really wanna (fight)
'cause nobody's gonna (win), i think you should come home
and i don't want you to (go), i don't really wanna (fight)
'cause nobody's gonna (win), i think you should come home
and i don't want you to (go), i don't really wanna (fight)
'cause nobody's gonna (win), just thought you should know
and i'll never let you (go) 'cause i know this is a (fight)
that someday we're gonna (win)


it's you and me, that's my whole world
they whisper in the hallway, "she's a bad, bad girl"
oh, i just thought you should know (you should know)
it's you and me, there's nothing like this (like this)
miss americana and the heartbreak prince (okay)
we're so sad, we paint the town blue (paint it blue)
voted most likely to run away with you


and i don't want you to (go), i don't really wanna (fight)
'cause nobody's gonna (win), i think you should come home
and i'll never let you (go) 'cause i know this is a (fight)
that someday we're gonna (win), just thought you should know


it's you and me, that's my whole world
they whisper in the hallway, "she's a bad, bad girl"
"she's a bad, bad girl"

the moon is high
like your friends were the night that we first met
went home and tried to stalk you on the internet
now i've read all of the books beside your bed
the wine is cold
like the shoulder that i gave you in the street
cat and mouse for a month or two or three
now i wake up in the night and watch you breathe


(ayy)
kiss me once 'cause you know i had a long night (oh)
kiss me twice 'cause it's gonna be alright (uh)
three times 'cause i waited my whole life (one, two, one, two, three, four)


i like shiny things, but i'd marry you with paper rings
uh-huh, that's right
darling, you're the one i want, and
i hate accidents, except when we went from friends to this
uh-huh, that's right
darling, you're the one i want
in paper rings, in picture frames, in dirty dreams
oh, you're the one i want


in the winter, in the icy outdoor pool
when you jumped in first, i went in too
i'm with you even if it makes me blue
which takes me back
to the color that we painted your brother's wall
honey, without all the exes, fights and flaws
we wouldn't be standing here so tall, so


(ayy)
kiss you once 'cause i know you had a long night (oh)
kiss you twice 'cause it's gonna be alright (uh)
three times 'cause you waited your whole life (one, two, one, two, three, four)
ah


i like shiny things, but i'd marry you with paper rings
uh-huh, that's right
darling, you're the one i want, and
i hate accidents, except when we went from friends to this
uh-huh, that's right
darling, you're the one i want
in paper rings, in picture frames, in dirty dreams
oh, you're the one i want


i want to drive away with you
i want your complications too
i want your dreary mondays
wrap your arms around me, baby boy
i want to drive away with you
i want your complications too
i want your dreary mondays
wrap your arms around me, baby boy
uh-huh


i like shiny things, but i'd marry you with paper rings
ah-ah, that's right, you're the one i want
i hate accidents, except when we went from friends to this
ah-ah, darling, you're the one i want
i like shiny things, but i'd marry you with paper rings
uh-huh, that's right
darling, you're the one i want, and
i hate accidents, except when we went from friends to this
uh-huh, that's right
darling, you're the one i want
in paper rings, in picture frames, in all my dreams
you're the one i want
in paper rings, in picture frames, in all my dreams
oh, you're the one i want


you're the one i want, one i want
you're the one i want, one i want

combat, i'm ready for combat
i say i don't want that, but what if i do?
'cause cruelty wins in the movies
i've got a hundred thrown-out speeches i almost said to you


easy they come, easy they go
i jump from the train, i ride off alone
i never grew up, it's getting so old
help me hold on to you


i've been the archer, i've been the prey
who could ever leave me, darling
but who could stay?


dark side, i search for your dark side
but what if i'm alright, right, right, right here?
and i cut off my nose just to spite my face
then i hate my reflection for years and years


i wake in the night, i pace like a ghost
the room is on fire, invisible smoke
and all of my heroes die all alone
help me hold on to you


i've been the archer, i've been the prey
screaming, who could ever leave me, darling
but who could stay?
(i see right through me, i see right through me)


'cause they see right through me
they see right through me
they see right through
can you see right through me?
they see right through
they see right through me
i see right through me
i see right through me


all the king's horses, all the king's men
couldn't put me together again
'cause all of my enemies started out friends
help me hold on to you


i've been the archer, i've been the prey
who could ever leave me, darling
but who could stay?
(i see right through me, i see right through me)
who could stay?
who could stay?
who could stay?
you could stay
you could stay


combat, i'm ready for combat

i would be complex, i would be cool
they'd say i played the field before i found someone to commit to
and that would be okay for me to do
every conquest i had made would make me more of a boss to you


i’d be a fearless leader, i'd be an alpha type
when everyone believes ya, what's that like?


i’m so sick of running as fast as i can
wonderin' if i'd get there quicker if i was a man
and i'm so sick of them comin' at me again
'cause if i was a man, then i'd be the man
i'd be the man (man)
i’d be the man (man)


they’d say i hustled, put in the work
they wouldn't shake their heads and question how much of this i deserve
what i was wearing, if i was rude
could all be separated from my good ideas and power moves


and they would toast to me, oh (ayy), let the players play
i’d be just like leo in saint-tropez


i'm so sick of running as fast as i can
wonderin' if i'd get there quicker if i was a man
and i’m so sick of them comin' at me again
'cause if i was a man, then i'd be the man
i'd be the man (man)
i'd be the man (man)


what's it like to brag about raking in dollars
and getting bitches and models?
and it's all good if you're bad
and it's okay if you're mad
if i was out flashin' my dollars
i'd be a bitch, not a baller
they'd paint me out to be bad
so it's okay that i'm mad


i'm so sick of running as fast as i can
wonderin' if i'd get there quicker if i was a man (you know that)
and i'm so sick of them comin' at me again (comin' at me again)
'cause if i was a man (if i was a man), then i'd be the man (then i'd be the man)
i'm so sick of running as fast as i can (as fast as i can)
wonderin' if i'd get there quicker if i was a man (hey)
and i'm so sick of them comin' at me again (comin' at me again)
'cause if i was a man (if i was a man), then i'd be the man
i'd be the man (man)
i'd be the man (man, oh)
i'd be the man (man, yeah)
i'd be the man (man, i'd be the man)


if i was a man
then i'd be the man

you are somebody that i don't know
but you're takin' shots at me like it's patrón
and i'm just like, damn, it's 7 am
say it in the street, that's a knock-out
but you say it in a tweet, that's a cop-out
and i'm just like, "hey, are you okay?"


and i ain't tryna mess with your self-expression
but i've learned a lesson that stressin' and obsessin' 'bout somebody else is no fun
and snakes and stones never broke my bones


so oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
you need to calm down, you're being too loud
and i'm just like oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh (oh)
you need to just stop, like can you just not step on my gown?
you need to calm down


you are somebody that we don't know
but you're comin' at my friends like a missile
why are you mad when you could be glaad? (you could be glaad)
sunshine on the street at the parade
but you would rather be in the dark ages
makin' that sign must've taken all night


you just need to take several seats and then try to restore the peace
and control your urges to scream about all the people you hate
'cause shade never made anybody less gay


so oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
you need to calm down, you're being too loud
and i'm just like oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh (oh)
you need to just stop, like can you just not step on his gown?
you need to calm down


and we see you over there on the internet
comparing all the girls who are killing it
but we figured you out
we all know now we all got crowns
you need to calm down


oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
you need to calm down (you need to calm down)
you're being too loud (you're being too loud)
and i'm just like oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh (oh)
you need to just stop (can you stop?)
like can you just not step on our gowns?
you need to calm down
